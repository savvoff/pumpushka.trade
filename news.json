    "title": "Here’s How High The Dogecoin Price Will Go Once The MACD Bullish Cross Happens",
    "body": "The Dogecoin price has been drifting through a subdued stretch over the past few days, holding around the mid-$0.13 to $0.14. The recent decline has slowed down in the past 48 hours, and the chart now shows the meme coin attempting to steady itself after weeks of persistent selling pressure. Trader Tardigrade, a well-known crypto analyst on X, shared a new three-day chart suggesting that an important MACD signal is on the verge of forming, and historical performance shows that Dogecoin tends to move bullish once this signal appears. Approaching The MACD Bullish Cross Dogecoin’s quiet phase in the past 48 hours has become increasingly important because one of Dogecoin’s higher-timeframe indicators is beginning to show early signs of life. According to Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin’s MACD indicator on the 3-day candlestick price chart has not yet confirmed a bullish cross, but it is very close to doing so. Related Reading: Trend Reversal Puts Dogecoin On A Path To $0.188 The chart he shared shows the MACD lines converging at the lower boundary of the recent downtrend, and the blue line is approaching the red line. The blue line is about to cross over the red one, mirroring the exact setup that preceded previous breakouts earlier this year. Even with Dogecoin trading quietly in recent days, the compression of the MACD indicator hints that bearish momentum is fading. Once the cross officially forms, the trend will shift into a bullish one. This gradual tightening of price movement is also characteristic of an accumulation phase, and this is shown by an important Dogecoin metric. Dogecoin Price Chart, MACD Cross. Source: @TATrader_Alan On X How High The Dogecoin Price Could Go The chart reveals a clear pattern: every time Dogecoin printed a three-day MACD bullish cross in 2025, the price responded with a significant upward move. The first cross was in April, and this preceded a rally that pushed Dogecoin’s price from below $0.14 into a breakout to $0.26. A second cross followed during mid-summer in July, and once again the price climbed aggressively shortly afterward. This saw the Dogecoin price rally from around $0.16 to $0.30 very briefly. Related Reading: The MicroStrategy Of Asia: Japanese Company Announces Plan For Bitcoin And XRP Treasury Both events are circled on the chart above, showing how the momentum flipped swiftly once the MACD crossed above the signal line. These repeated reactions strengthen the case that Dogecoin could be preparing for another sizeable run if the indicator confirms a cross in the coming days. The projection area drawn on the right side of the chart points to a climb that extends well above $0.20. This suggests that the next wave may revisit the upper levels where Dogecoin last traded during its late-summer rally. The analyst’s chart outlines a wide upward arc, indicating that the expected move would not be a minor rebound but a structured uptrend similar to the earlier surges this year. In terms of a price target, the projection shows Dogecoin reaching a price target around $0.35 in the next few weeks. This would translate to a 140% increase from Dogecoin’s current price of $0.142.

    "title": "Smart Whales Align: Top Performers Go All-In On Ethereum Long Positions With Over $425M in Exposure",
    "body": "Ethereum has reclaimed the $3,150 level after a volatile stretch, offering a rare sign of strength in an otherwise uncertain market. The broader crypto landscape remains sharply divided: some analysts argue that ETH and the rest of the market still face downward continuation, potentially setting new local lows, while others believe this correction is simply a reset before a much larger bull cycle—possibly extending into 2026. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Break $97K To Restore Confidence Among Youngest Long-Term Holders – Details Yet one signal stands out clearly amid the noise: smart whales are unanimously going long on ETH. On-chain data shows that several of the most profitable and consistent whale traders—each with tens of millions in realized gains—have opened substantial long positions, collectively exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars. Their coordinated behavior indicates confidence that Ethereum’s recent lows represent opportunity rather than danger. This alignment among top-performing whales introduces a compelling counterpoint to bearish narratives. While retail sentiment remains fragile, the most sophisticated market participants appear to be positioning for a larger move ahead. As Ethereum stabilizes above $3,150, the question now becomes whether whale conviction will prove to be early—or correct. Top Performers Load Up on Ethereum According to Hyperdash data shared by Lookonchain, some of the most successful and influential whales in the market are aggressively accumulating Ethereum—sending a strong signal that high-conviction players expect upside ahead. One of the most notable is BitcoinOG, the trader widely recognized for shorting the market during the violent 10/10 crash, a move that earned him significant credibility. With a total realized PNL of $105 million, BitcoinOG is now positioned firmly on the bullish side, holding 54,277 ETH worth approximately $169.48 million. Another major player is the well-known Anti-CZ whale, named for his historical pattern of taking the opposite side of positions favored by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. With an impressive $58.8 million in total PNL, this whale is currently long 62,156 ETH—a massive $194 million position. His trades have often been early indicators of broad market direction, adding weight to this shift toward bullish exposure. Finally, pension-usdt.eth, a consistently profitable whale address with $16.3 million in realized gains, is long 20,000 ETH valued at $62.5 million. Taken together, these positions reflect a unified stance among top-performing whales: despite market uncertainty, they are positioning for Ethereum strength. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows Signs Of Accumulation As CVD Strengthens And Correlation Stays Elevated Weekly Structure Shows Early Signs of Stabilization Ethereum’s weekly chart reveals a market attempting to regain its footing after a sharp multi-week decline from the $4,500 region. The recent reclaim of $3,150 is a meaningful development, as this level aligns closely with prior weekly support from mid-2024 and sits just above the 50-week moving average—an area that often acts as a trend-defining zone. ETH briefly dipped below this region during the November selloff, but buyers stepped in aggressively, producing a strong weekly wick that signals demand at lower levels. Despite this recovery attempt, ETH remains below key resistance levels. The 20-week and 100-week moving averages are positioned above the current price and converging, creating a zone of potential rejection unless momentum strengthens. For now, ETH is trading in a transitional structure: no longer trending downward aggressively, but not yet showing a confirmed bullish reversal on high timeframes. Related Reading: Ethereum NUPL Holds Steady, Signaling Market Balance Amid Volatility Volume patterns also support this interpretation. Selling volume has diminished compared to the capitulation phase, while recent green candles show moderate but steady buying interest—suggesting accumulation rather than full risk-on behavior. If ETH can establish consecutive weekly closes above $3,200–$3,300, the chart opens the door for a retest of the $3,600–$3,800 range. Failure to hold $3,150, however, risks another move toward $2,800 support. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Is Just Getting Started — 200x Growth Possible, Tom Lee Says Around 2 million people in four regional banks can now buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and USDC through the apps. Measured Limited Rollout The launch covers the Provence-Alpes-Côte-d’Azur branch of Caisse d’Épargne and the Île-de-France division of Banque Populaire, among others. BPCE has said it will watch early use closely. That controlled approach is meant to catch technical issues and fix the user flow before wider availability. If all goes to plan, the bank intends to extend the feature across its 25 remaining regional entities by 2026, reaching a retail base of roughly 12 million clients. 🔴 EXCLUSIVE @TheBigWhale_: BPCE now lets customers buy crypto assets. Starting this Monday, the French bank’s customers will be able to purchase BTC, ETH, SOL, and USDC: https://t.co/J2C4UnWi68@GroupeBPCE, one of Europe’s leading banks, is rolling out this service in a first… pic.twitter.com/3olRgVoot4 — Raphaël Bloch 🐳 (@Raph_Bloch) December 6, 2025 BPCE has set up a separate unit, Hexarq, to handle customer crypto accounts. Each user will have a dedicated in-app digital-asset account that is managed by Hexarq rather than being routed to outside exchanges or third-party wallets. The arrangement keeps custody within the bank’s ecosystem. It also comes with a monthly fee of €2.99 and a trading commission of 1.5% on transactions. Banks Face Fintech Pressure Reports have pointed to the rise of fintech rivals as a driving reason for the move. Companies such as Revolut, Deblock, Bitstack and Trade Republic built early crypto offerings and attracted many retail users. Traditional lenders now risk losing younger customers unless they match those services. Some banks in Europe already offer in-app trading: BBVA supports Bitcoin and Ethereum, Openbank under Santander lists five cryptocurrencies, and Raiffeisen in Vienna provides similar features through a tie-up with Bitpanda. BPCE’s entry follows this trend and could push other big lenders to act.

    "title": "XRP Selloff: Whales Shed Coins Worth $1 Billion In A Week",
    "body": "On-chain data shows the XRP whales have distributed a significant amount during the past week, a sign of negative sentiment among large holders. XRP Whales Have Shed 510 Million Tokens From Their Holdings As announced by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, XRP whales have participated in a notable amount of selling recently. A “whale” is typically defined as an XRP investor holding between 1 million and 10 million tokens. At the current exchange rate of the cryptocurrency, this range converts to $2 million at the lower end and $20 million at the upper one. Related Reading: This 11.7 Billion Dogecoin Wall Could Be Key Resistance For DOGE, Analyst Says Given the size of the range, the only investors who would qualify for the cohort would be the big-money hands. These holders can carry some influence in the market, making the group a key one for the network. Now, here is the chart from on-chain analytics firm Santiment shared by Martinez that shows how the supply of the XRP whales has changed over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP whale supply has been following a downtrend since mid-November, indicating that the large holders have been distributing. The trend has continued during the past week, with entities belonging to the group collectively selling 510 million coins, worth more than $2 billion at the latest price. At the same time as the selloff over the last few weeks, XRP has witnessed some net bearish price action, implying that the whales may have had a role to play in it. Given that these humongous entities haven’t shown any signs of slowing down recently, it’s possible that the coin could see a further drop. It only remains to be seen, however, how whale behavior will develop in the coming days. In some other news, XRP could be set up for a 16% move according to a technical analysis (TA) pattern, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post. From the chart, it’s visible that XRP has roughly been traveling inside a Symmetrical Triangle on the 1-hour timeframe since November. A Symmetrical Triangle is a consolidation channel that involves two converging trendlines approaching each other at an equal and opposite slope. The coin is already more than halfway through the channel, meaning that its range is getting narrow. A narrower range means retests of the support and resistance levels become more frequent, making either more probable. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Structure Echoes 2022 Bear Start, Glassnode Warns Based on the height of the channel, the analyst has noted that a breakout could lead to a 16% move for XRP. It now remains to be seen which direction the asset will exit, and whether the pattern will hold. XRP Price XRP has again found a rebound since its retest of the $2.00 level, as its price is now back at $2.09. Featured image from Dall-E, charts from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Active Addresses Slide As ETF Era Rewires Market Participation — Here’s Why",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s on-chain activity has shown a sharp slowdown since spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched. While institutional inflows into these products have accelerated, the number of active BTC addresses has declined. As Wall Street embraces BTC exposure, the network’s grassroots participation appears to be undergoing a significant transformation. In an X post, the CEO of SwanDesk, financial analyst Jacob King, pointed out that Bitcoin active addresses have been in a steady decline since the US spot BTC ETFs launched in January 2024, and the irony is obvious. Why Retail Participation Shows Signs Of Fatigue For years, BTC maximalists have pushed for Wall Street adoption, believing institutional involvement would unlock the next wave of mass usage. Instead, on-chain participation has dropped sharply as retail lost interest. Related Reading: US Fed Has Ended Quantitative Tightening, But Why Is The Bitcoin Price Still Below $100,000? King noted that these Bitcoiners have piled into the ETF for a quick, early FOMO bump, and then bailed, leaving behind a market where the asset is increasingly traded by proxy. According to King, ETF investing kills BTC’s core principles. While investors no longer hold or control their own assets as banks do, which is the very system BTC was designed to challenge, greed always beats ideology. Market watcher Crypto Seth has revealed that the net inflows into BlackRock and Fidelity’s spot BTC ETFs have been relatively subdued since October 10, when the largest liquidation events happened. Seth believes that this might turn into a momentum reversal soon, as the US stock market is at 1% below new highs despite retail sentiment remaining stuck in extreme fear. Seth also pointed out that the macro backdrop is shifting in BTC’s favor. This is because the Federal Reserve ended its Quantitative Tightening (QT) program on December 1, 2025, wrapping up a multi-year effort that shaved nearly $3 trillion from the balance sheet since 2022. Since the US Fed rate is still at 4.00%, more interest rate cuts are on the horizon, which is higher than both Europe and China. The BlackRock iShares BTC Trust (IBIT), which was launched in January 2024, is currently the firm’s most profitable exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on annual fee revenue, despite being less than two years old. Unlocking Bitcoin Without Compromising Its Core Principles Bitcoin is seeing key initiatives that improve its ecosystem. Every market cycle that has promise to unlock Bitcoin for decentralized finance (DeFi), RioSwap is one of the few products built on infrastructure that was capable of unlocking it in a truly decentralized way. Related Reading: Bitcoin Aims Higher as Bulls Regain Strength and Push for Resistance Break According to Mintlayer, this was powered by Mintlayer’s native HTLC architecture, as RioSwap introduces a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that allows BTC to move directly into decentralized markets without wrapping, unbridging, and is fully in the user’s control. With the RioSwap testnet now live, Mintlayer sees this as the start of a new liquidity phase for BTC where the asset will become an active participant in the decentralized market on its own terms.

    "title": "All Eyes On Ethereum: Price Attempts Key Breakout As BlackRock Files For Staked ETH ETF",
    "body": "After weeks of speculation, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has officially filed for a staked Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Amid the bullish news, the King of Altcoins’ price is attempting to break out of a two-month resistance, which could set the stage for a retest of higher levels. Related Reading: XRP ETFs Record 13-Day Streak As SOL Funds See Largest Outflows Since Launch BlackRock Files For Staked Ethereum ETF BlackRock has submitted an S-1 form with the US SEC to get approval for its iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ETHB), which “seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of ether and rewards from staking a portion of the Trust’s ether, to the extent the Sponsor in its sole discretion determines that the Trust may do so without incurring undue legal or regulatory risk.” Filed on December 5, BlackRock’s registration statement explains that, if approved, the proposed fund aims to stake 70% to 90% of its Ethereum holdings, distributing staking rewards to stakeholders at least quarterly. Coinbase Custody Trust will serve as the custodian for the Trust’s ETH holdings, the filing noted, while Anchorage Digital Bank will be an available alternative custodian for the Trust’s ether holdings. Meanwhile, the Bank of New York Mellon will serve as the custodian for the Trust’s cash holdings and the administrator of the Trust. Notably, BlackRock’s ETHB will operate separately from its spot ETH fund, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), which is the largest in its category with $11 billion in assets under management (AUM). It’s worth noting that the crypto community began speculating about BlackRock’s upcoming staked ETH fund after the leading asset manager registered the name in Delaware last month. In a November report, 10x Research argued that the potential introduction of a staked Ethereum ETF by BlackRock would bring “increased scrutiny” to “the economics of DATs” as retail investors would reallocate to a low-cost source of yield. The report added that many investors are unaware that Digital Asset Treasury (DATs)’s embedded costs “far exceed” the management fee charged by asset managers like BlackRock on its Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH ETFs. ETH Nears Key Downtrend Line Ethereum’s price started the week attempting to reclaim a crucial area after managing to hold the $3,000 level as support despite the volatility during the weekend. The cryptocurrency surged nearly 3% in the daily timeframe, hitting $3,180 before retracing on Monday. Amid this performance, analyst Ali Martinez suggested that “it’s time to pay attention to ETH,” noting that it nears a key level that could push the price to higher zones. Per the chart, Ethereum briefly broke out of its two-month downtrend line, which has served as resistance since early October. Over this period, the King of Altcoins has attempted to break out of this level twice, but has ultimately been rejected during each attempt. On Monday morning, ETH briefly broke above the trendline before being rejected a third time. However, if Ethereum reclaims the $3,120-$3,130 levels and turns the downtrend into support, it could build the base for a retest of the $3,200-$3,300 horizontal levels, which marks the lower boundary of its Q3 and early Q4 price range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Slides Below $90,000 – Is A Retest Of The November Lows Near? Meanwhile, Rekt Capital asserted that Ethereum Dominance (ETHDOM) continues to move within its macro consolidation range, holding support at the 11.67% level. He previously affirmed that if “ETHDOM can maintain itself above 10.05% then it should be positioned for higher market dominance levels over time.” The analyst added that although history suggests a potential 2.5% drop to the consolidation range lows, this dip would occur “in the context of a macro move to 18%-20%” in the future. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,114, a 13.7% increase on the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "New Bitcoin Crash Incoming? Twenty One Capital Moves 43,500 BTC Amid Major Losses",
    "body": "Twenty One Capital, a major player in the Bitcoin (BTC) treasury sector founded by Jack Mallers, is on the verge of going public in the United States. However, ahead of its highly anticipated debut on December 9, the company has moved a substantial sum of 43,500 BTC—approximately worth $4.5 billion—into an escrow wallet. This move has sparked market concerns about a potential sell-off, which could create major selling pressure for the leading cryptocurrency as it attempts to consolidate above the key $90,000 support level. $1.5 Billion Loss In Bitcoin Investments Experts on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), such as OxNobler, have pointed out that the company is currently grappling with a significant $1.5 billion loss on its Bitcoin investment. He warned that this financial pressure could potentially lead to a new crash for Bitcoin and adversely affect the broader cryptocurrency market as well. Related Reading: Here’s How High The Dogecoin Price Will Go Once The MACD Bullish Cross Happens The apprehension surrounding this situation is reflected in Bitcoin’s price action, as the leading cryptocurrency dipped below $90,000 earlier on Monday amid growing uncertainty about its future trajectory. However, Jack Mallers had previously addressed the reasoning behind this monumental Bitcoin transfer. According to him, this step is part of the preparations for Twenty One Capital’s upcoming listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). As part of the transaction, the company is transitioning 43,500 BTC from third-party custody to a self-custody account, ensuring transparency by updating its proof of reserves accordingly. The firm, backed by major players like Tether and SoftBank, aims to take on Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin proxy firm Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) in the competitive Bitcoin treasury sector. A significant milestone was reached on December 3, when shareholders of CEP approved a business merger with Twenty One Capital, paving the way for the company’s initial public offering (IPO). Once the transactions are finalized, the combined entity will operate as Twenty One Capital, Inc., with its shares expected to begin trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “XXI.” Twenty One Capital Gears Up For IPO Amid the preparations for its anticipated debut in the US, the firm has indicated that it will focus exclusively on Bitcoin-related ventures, offering shareholders new opportunities to gain exposure to BTC through equity markets. With a Bitcoin-native operating framework and a long-term strategy designed for value creation, Twenty One intends to establish itself as a leading platform for capital-efficient Bitcoin accumulation and related business initiatives.

Morgan Chase threw me out of the bank… Whenever I asked them why, I received the same response: ‘We aren’t allowed to tell you,’” Mallers recounted on November 23. The closure letter cited “concerning activity” and referenced the Bank Secrecy Act, preventing him from reopening accounts at the bank.

    "title": "Bitcoin Speculation Muted: Glassnode Analyst Calls Perps A ‘Ghost Town’",
    "body": "Glassnode’s senior researcher has pointed out how Bitcoin perpetual futures market is looking like a “ghost town,” with Open Interest continuing to be at muted levels. Bitcoin Futures Open Interest Has Remained Low Since October Reset In a new post on X, Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt.₿ has talked about the recent trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest for the perpetual futures market. The “Open Interest” refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of positions related to the asset that are currently open on all centralized derivatives platforms. Related Reading: This 11.7 Billion Dogecoin Wall Could Be Key Resistance For DOGE, Analyst Says When the value of the metric rises, it means the investors are opening new positions related to the asset. Generally, new positions come with fresh leverage for the sector, so the cryptocurrency’s price can become more volatile following an increase in the Open Interest. On the other hand, the indicator going down suggests the perpetual futures traders are either closing up position of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform. Such a trend can lead to more stable price action for BTC due to the clearing of leverage. Now, here is the chart shared by CryptoVizArt.₿ that shows the trend in the Bitcoin perpetual futures Open Interest (BTC-denominated) over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the BTC-denominated Bitcoin perpetual futures Open Interest saw a sharp plunge back in October as a result of the crash in the cryptocurrency’s price. Following the leverage flush, the indicator traveled sideways around its lows, but in mid-November, speculation noted an uptick as the asset’s drawdown continued, with the metric’s value peaking alongside the level that has so far acted as the bottom. Since this high, however, the indicator has cooled off once again and approached the same lows as the ones that followed the massive liquidation event in October. Thus, with Open Interest back under 310,000 BTC, it seems speculative interest in the market has once again become muted. The recent decline in speculative participation has come alongside a drop in the perpetual futures Funding Rate, a metric tracking the amount of periodic fee being exchanged between the short and long investors. From the chart, it’s visible that the Bitcoin perpetual futures Funding Rate has been going down since a while now. “This persistent drift lower reflects a decline in leveraged long conviction, with traders unwilling to pay a premium to maintain upside exposure,” noted the Glassnode researcher.

    "title": "Dogecoin Price Will Rally Before It Crashes, But What’s The Target?",
    "body": "The Dogecoin price is already struggling amid the bearish pressure that has dominated the crypto market recently. After the initial fall to $0.2, DOGE bulls had attempted to hold support, pushing for a rebound. However, with the bearish headwinds of the last quarter of the year, the Dogecoin price has since succumbed and is now trading below the $0.15 support level, and continues to struggle. Despite the already troubling price performance, crypto analyst Weslad says that the worst might be yet to come. This is due to a corrective structure that has appeared on the meme coin’s price chart, and the result of this has been a bearish flag. As these technical developments unfold, the crypto analyst has warned investors of what to expect, outlining why the Dogecoin price could see a major crash while attempting to recover. Dogecoin Price To Rise And Then Fall The analysis, which was shared on the TradingView website, points to the bearish flag as a precursor of what is to come. Weslad explains that the bearish flag had triggered the Dogecoin price breakdown that had led to the downward leg. As a result, the sentiment has skewed negative so far, suggesting that there could be more declines to come. Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Shows Shocking Similarities To 2012-2015, But What Happened Last Time? However, the crypto analyst points out that the Dogecoin price is still well below its breakout zone. Given this, it is likely that there could be an initial relief rally for the meme coin. If this rally plays out, then there would be an initial decline below $0.12 to form support above $0.118. Once this support is established, then the resulting bounce is expected to push the Dogecoin price to $0.2. Once this move is completed, though, the analyst predicts an even deeper crash on the horizon. From the $0.2 mark, Weslad’s chart shows that the Dogecoin price could decline another 70%, falling toward $0.05 in the process, which would mean a return to 2-year lows. Related Reading: Confirming The Bitcoin Price Direction: Analyst Reveals What You Should Look Out For “The immediate plan is to monitor a pullback toward the minimum bearish flag targets around the $0.12 region, which aligns with the former structure support and breakout zone,” the crypto analyst said. This bottom area serves as a “supply on the retest” and could trigger the next decline. For now, the analyst expects that the Dogecoin price will continue on its bearish path. This is dependent on the broader market performance, and so far, a breakdown looks to be more likely. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "XRP Spot ETFs have nearly crossed the $1 billion mark in assets under management (AUM), marking one of the quickest ramps since Ethereum, according to Ripple’s CEO. Related Reading: All-In On XRP: Why This Leading Investor Sold His Entire Bitcoin Stack Rapid Fund Growth In Weeks According to the disclosure, the four XRP ETF products now hold about $1.23B in total net assets, which equals 597 million XRP at a reported XRP price of $2.06. Reports have disclosed a fresh inflow of $30 million on Monday, Dec. 8, and the cumulative net inflow into these products stands close to $935 million. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted that the collective figure reached the $1 billion level in under four weeks after the first fund hit the market. Canary Capital Leads With Heavy Flows Canary Capital’s XRPC grabbed the most attention at launch, bringing roughly $245 million in net flows on its debut day on Nov. 13. Canary’s fund holds about 335.889 million XRP, valued at approximately $691 million, which represents 56% of the combined assets across the four funds. 👀<4 weeks, and XRP is now the fastest crypto Spot ETF to reach $1B in AUM (since ETH) in the US. With over 40 crypto ETFs launched this year in the US alone, a few points are obvious to me: 1/ there’s pent up demand for regulated crypto products, and with Vanguard opening up… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 8, 2025 The other managers hold smaller shares: Grayscale’s product holds 104.381 million XRP, about $215 million or 17.47% of the total; Bitwise carries 93.827 million XRP valued at $193.284 million or 15.7%; Franklin Templeton has 62.99 million XRP worth about $131.829 million, or 10.71%. A Wave Of Approved Crypto Funds Based on reports, this development follows a broader rollout of spot and futures crypto ETFs since US spot Bitcoin ETFs arrived in January 2024. Ethereum spot products launched in July 2024, and Solana listings came in October 2025. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has approved more than 40 crypto-related ETF products this year, which market participants say has opened familiar rails for mainstream investors. Vanguard’s choice to allow crypto access inside standard retirement and broker accounts is being cited as a change that lets many Americans gain exposure without deep crypto know-how. What This Means For Investors According to analysts and market observers, the speed of these flows underlines strong demand for regulated crypto vehicles. Big-name asset managers entering the market have helped create options that look and act like other mutual funds or ETFs, which can ease the path for retirement plans and advisers to take part. At the same time, a large share resting in a single debut fund shows concentration risk: Canary’s XRPC accounts for more than half of the total net assets, and that matters for liquidity and fund dynamics if flows shift.

    "title": "Pundit Highlights The Condition That Will Trigger A 2,300% XRP Rally To $50",
    "body": "The XRP price is currently more than 45% below its all-time high and continues to decline amid broader market uncertainty. Despite the slow price action and weak momentum, a crypto analyst has projected that XRP could explode to $50 soon, providing reasons for his ambitious forecast. He boldly stated that the cryptocurrency will not experience a gradual climb to $5 or $10 first, but will instead jump straight to $50. XRP To Hit $50 With A Ripple Bank Charter Crypto analyst Pumpius has outlined a compelling scenario that could dramatically transform XRP’s market outlook. The market expert claims that a single regulatory event could catapult XRP’s price to $50, representing more than a 2,300% increase from current levels around $2. In his thread post on X, he explained the reasons for his bold prediction and the trigger behind this parabolic surge . Related Reading: Here’s How High The Dogecoin Price Will Go Once The MACD Bullish Cross Happens Pumpius believes that XRP could skyrocket to $50 once Ripple secures a national trust bank charter from the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). According to him, approval of this banking license would give Ripple the same powers as major US banks, as well as direct access to the Federal Reserve (FED). The analyst noted that through the charter, Ripple could gain the authority to custody crypto and tokenized assets, issue stablecoins, and settle securities under complete regulatory oversight. He described the potential approval of the banking license as a foundational move that could establish Ripple as a leading force in US tokenized finance. Pumpius highlighted that XRP remains at the centre of the changes, positioned as the native bridge asset in this potential structure. He suggested that with a charter in place, banks, brokers, and funds could bypass intermediaries and interact directly with Ripple to move value into tokenized markets. According to the analyst’s predictions, the result of this shift could be a massive, sustained surge in liquidity and institutional demand for XRP, creating the ideal conditions for an unprecedented price rally. He explains that with $6.6 trillion moving through banks each day in global settlements, even a small fraction routed through XRP’s limited supply could drive its price higher toward $50. While the market expert’s forecast is ambitious, it hinges entirely on the OCC’s decision, which is not guaranteed and could be influenced by compliance standards, risk assessments, and broader financial policy considerations. Even with approval, actual integration by major institutions would likely take considerable time and depend on competition with existing settlement networks. Ripple Legal Victory Paves Way For $50 XRP Price In his post, Pumpius suggested that Ripple’s prolonged legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was part of a broader strategy to secure regulatory clarity. He viewed the former lawsuit as a smokescreen intended to delay, filter, and prepare the path for a national trust bank charter under the OCC. With the case now resolved, the analyst indicates that the timing is perfect for Ripple to pursue full regulatory approval and integrate XRP into mainstream banking channels. Related Reading: Ethereum Founder Breaks Silence With Major Upgrade Proposal Pumpius boldly declared that the day the OCC approves Ripple’s banking license will mark a turning point for XRP, transforming it from a cryptocurrency to “the rails of US finance.” At that point, the analyst argues that a $50 price target would be significantly undervalued.
