    "title": "Dogecoin Price Could Rally To All-Time Highs If It Breaks This Resistance Level",
    "body": "Crypto analyst BALO has predicted that the Dogecoin price could still rally to new all-time highs (ATHs) despite its decline last year. He revealed what level DOGE needs to reclaim to trigger this massive breakout that could lead to new highs. Dogecoin Price Eyes Rally To ATH With Reclaim Of This Level In an X post, BALO stated that a reclaim of $0.13 could trigger a massive breakout for the Dogecoin price and could lead to a new all-time high (ATH) for the top meme coin. His statement came just before DOGE reclaimed this level, rallying double digits in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Dogecoin Long-Term Bullish Structure Still In Play And Will Cross $10 The Dogecoin price rallied alongside other meme coins, with PEPE leading the way with a daily gain of as much as 35%. With DOGE now back above $0.13, a new all-time high could be on the cards, as BALO predicted. His accompanying chart showed that the meme coin could reach a yearly high of around $0.44 this year, then rally to a new ATH of $0.74 in 2027. Crypto analyst Neo offered a more bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, suggesting it could rally to as high as $35. In an X post, the analyst highlighted an ascending trendline for DOGE, with the middle of the trendline placing the meme coin at $4, and the target at the top of the trendline at $35. Neo alluded to DOGE’s historical performance, noting that in 2021, the Dogecoin price surged from the lower limit to the upper limit in one go. The analyst further remarked that there is the potential for that to happen again this time. His accompanying suggested that this parabolic rally could happen before this year ends. Why A Rally To $0.75 Is Possible Crypto analyst Bitcoinsensus raised the possibility of a Dogecoin price rally to $0.75 and explained why DOGE could rally 450% to this resistance level. The analyst noted that each previous accumulation phase has led to a strong upswing in price. As such, Bitcoinsensus said that this might indicate what could happen next for the meme coin, with a potential rally to a new ATH.

He further remarked that the next thing needed is a weekly close above this level, and then DOGE could be “back in business.” The analyst had previously stated a reclaim of this level would be a huge positive, with his accompanying chart suggesting that this could put a potential rally to $0.4 on the cards. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.14, up over 11% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "Why The Ethereum Price Could Bounce Above $3,500 Soon",
    "body": "A crypto analyst has predicted that the Ethereum price could balloon to $3,500 soon, potentially breaking free of the bearish pressure that has suppressed its momentum for much of 2025. Although ETH is currently trading more than 37.5% below its all-time highs, the analyst has outlined technical indicators and market structure signals suggesting $3,500 is a realistic short-term target for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Crypto ETFs Defy The Pullback With $32 Billion In Fresh Investor Cash Ethereum Price Setup Points To $3,500 Rebound Crypto market analyst Tryrex has delivered a fresh outlook on the Ethereum price, pointing to conditions that could support a strong upside move to $3,500 in the coming months. In his post on X, the expert suggested that ETH may be approaching the end of its prolonged corrective phase and may be preparing for a decisive bounce. Tryrex highlighted the possibility of a strong rebound developing in the first quarter of 2026, driven by Ethereum’s current hold of a critical liquidity zone between $2,800 and $3,000. He explained that while Bitcoin (BTC) bottomed out in 2025 and entered a range-bound period right after, Ethereum showed relative strength by firmly defending the liquidity region. Based on the analyst’s weekly TradingView chart, this price area also represents a weekly demand zone that has absorbed repeated selling pressure. The fact that the price continues to hold this area indicates that market participants are buying ETH rather than distributing it. Volume behavior at the bottom of the chart also suggests that selling pressure has been weakening compared to earlier phases of Ethereum’s downtrend. Tryrex expects an impulsive move to emerge as Ethereum continues to react to the $2,800 to $3,000 liquidity range. If momentum builds as anticipated, ETH could break out of its current structure and push toward higher resistance levels, with a move above $3,500 seen as an increasingly likely near-term target. With its price currently sitting above $3,000, this would represent a more than 13% increase. The analyst has also revealed that his bullish forecast for ETH reflects broader conditions across the altcoin market. He highlighted that many major altcoins appear to be bottoming out after extended downtrends, increasing the possibility of coordinated upside moves if market sentiment and volatility improve. Ethereum Shows Early Moves In 2026 The market is just three days into 2026, and although major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin closed 2025 in the red, Ethereum appears to be showing early signs of recovery. Initially, the ETH started the year in a similar downtrend, but over the past 24 hours, its price has increased by approximately 2.5%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Altcoins Post Another Losing Year: Analyst CoinMarketCap data shows that from January 1 to date, Ethereum has declined by more than 9.5%. However, its trading volume in the last 24 hours has increased by over 100%, signaling strong trader interest despite the recent price dips. In addition, whales have been steadily accumulating ETH, taking advantage of lower prices to increase their positions. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Binance ETH Open Interest Surges Above $7.1B Amid Heavy Market Repositioning – Details",
    "body": "Amid the cheers of the new year, Ethereum achieved a decisive breakout above the long-standing price resistance around $3,000. According to market analyst Amr Taha, this price gain has been accompanied by significant changes in the derivatives market, which suggest an aggressive shift in investors’ positioning. Related Reading: 2026 Crypto Market Prediction: Will Prices Soar Or Face Continued Declines? Ethereum Traders Flood Market With Long Positions To Usher In 2026 In a QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, Amr Taha shares an in-depth analysis of the Binance derivatives market following ETH’s recent surge in the first days of 2026. Notably, the market expert reports an impulsive rise in ETH open interest on the world’s largest exchange, in what they described as “one of the strongest single-day increases seen recently. As the spot price climbed above $3,100, data from CryptoQuant shows that ETH open interest rose from approximately $6.2 billion to around $7.1 billion, representing a 12% increase in the last day. Taha highlights the importance of the coincidence, stating a rise in open interest amid price appreciation suggested that traders were opening fresh positions, rather than the move being driven solely by short covering. Interestingly, more data showed the ETH Cumulative Volume Delta – which measures the net difference between buying and selling volume over time – also rose alongside open interest, implying several positive developments. One of which is that long positions comprised the majority of the newly opened positions in the market, citing a heavy bullish sentiment around Ethereum. In addition, ETH buyers demonstrated heightened urgency by favoring market orders over passive limit bids, indicating aggressive taker-side demand, implying a strong market conviction that preferred to engage the market immediately rather than wait for lower prices. Related Reading: Popular Crypto Founder Dumps Millions In Ethereum, Here’s What He’s Buying A Potential Bull Trap? In analyzing the liquidation heatmap for the ETH derivative market, Amr Taha unveiled other critical price developments. Notably, ETH’s recent surge was partly driven by a short-squeeze effect around the $3,100 price level. Notably, when the altcoin touched this level, over-leveraged short traders had to defend their positions, effectively creating a market demand that translated into a sudden price gain. While the recent price increase and open interest boost represent positive moments for the market, Taha warns that forced liquidation often results in temporary resistance zones on the lower timeframe, especially when accompanied by rising funding rates. The analyst also explains that Ethereum’s price move appears leverage-driven and highly sentimental rather than structural, suggesting equal room for both opportunity and risk. At press time, the prominent altcoin trades at $3,087, representing a 2.51% gain in the last day. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",
