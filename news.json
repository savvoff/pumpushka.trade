    "title": "Ethereum Endures Historic Liquidation Week: Largest Sustained Liquidation Phase Since 2021",
    "body": "Ethereum continues to trade below the critical $2,000 level, reflecting persistent market pressure as traders await a clearer directional catalyst. The inability to reclaim this psychological threshold has kept sentiment cautious, with volatility elevated and liquidity conditions still uncertain. While price action has stabilized somewhat after recent declines, the broader structure suggests the market is preparing for a decisive move that could define Ethereum’s short-term trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Losses Hit Luna Crash Levels — But Price Context Points To A Different Market Phase A recent CryptoQuant report provides important context, indicating that the Ethereum market has undergone one of its most prolonged periods of stress since mid-2021. According to the data, the 7-day simple moving average of long liquidations on Binance climbed to roughly 9,000 ETH on February 6, 2026. Because this figure represents a smoothed weekly average rather than a single-day spike, it signals sustained pressure rather than a brief liquidation cascade. This pattern implies that leveraged long positions have been unwound gradually over several days. Pointing to persistent deleveraging rather than a sudden capitulation event. Historically, extended liquidation phases can reset market leverage and reduce speculative excess, though they also tend to coincide with fragile sentiment. Whether this process ultimately stabilizes Ethereum or leads to further downside remains dependent on liquidity conditions and broader market demand. Sustained Liquidations Signal Derivatives Market Reset The CryptoQuant report further notes that Ethereum’s decline from the $3,000 region to the $2,000 range did not trigger any capitulation events. Instead, the market experienced a prolonged sequence of margin calls, with leveraged long positions gradually unwound over several consecutive days. This pattern reflects persistent stress in the derivatives market rather than a short-lived liquidation cascade. Indicating that traders faced sustained pressure as the price trended lower. From a historical standpoint, the intensity and duration of this liquidation phase appear to exceed those recorded during major capitulation periods of the 2022 bear market. Such extended liquidation activity typically signals a broad deleveraging cycle, where excessive speculative positioning is systematically cleared. This process often reshapes market structure by reducing leverage-driven volatility and restoring a more balanced risk environment. The implication is that Ethereum may have already undergone a significant leverage reset in recent weeks. Persistently elevated liquidation averages can sometimes precede seller exhaustion. Weaker market participants exit positions, and forced selling pressure gradually subsides. The durability of any recovery will likely depend on renewed spot demand and macro liquidity conditions. Also, investor confidence must return following this extended period of derivatives-driven stress. Related Reading: Long-Term Ethereum Holders Expand Positions While Market Faces Pressure: Rare Signal Emerges Ethereum Tests Long-Term Support: Weekly Structure Weakens Ethereum’s weekly chart shows increasing structural pressure after the loss of the $2,000 level, a threshold that previously acted as both psychological support and a key technical pivot. The recent breakdown places ETH below major trend-defining moving averages, suggesting weakening bullish momentum and a shift toward a more defensive market environment. Price action reflects a clear rejection from the $3,000 region earlier in the cycle. Followed by a sequence of lower highs that typically characterizes transitional or corrective phases. The latest decline also coincides with rising trading volume, often associated with distribution or leveraged position unwinding rather than organic accumulation. This dynamic reinforces the perception of ongoing market stress rather than stabilization. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drop Wipes Billions From Recent Buyers: New Whale Cost Basis Falls Toward $90K From a structural standpoint, the next meaningful support area appears around the mid-$1,500 to $1,700 zone, where previous consolidation and demand emerged in earlier phases. Holding above this range would help preserve the broader long-term bullish framework, even amid current weakness. A sustained break below it, however, could shift sentiment toward a deeper corrective cycle. Ethereum remains sensitive to macro liquidity conditions, derivatives positioning, and overall crypto market sentiment, with recovery dependent on renewed spot demand and stabilization above key technical levels.

Recent price action suggests that bullish conviction has softened. Traders are increasingly attentive to liquidity conditions, macro uncertainty, and shifting market sentiment. While volatility is not unusual at this stage of the cycle, the current environment reflects a market searching for direction rather than sustaining a clear upward trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Losses Hit Luna Crash Levels — But Price Context Points To A Different Market Phase A recent CryptoQuant report provides additional context through Bitcoin’s Combined Market Index (BCMI), a composite metric that integrates valuation, profitability, spending behavior, and sentiment indicators. According to the analysis, BCMI has fallen into the low 0.2 range, a level historically associated more with early bear market phases — such as those seen in 2018 and 2022 — rather than routine mid-cycle corrections. This shift suggests a deeper structural adjustment may be underway. Notably, BCMI was hovering near 0.5 as recently as October, a zone typically interpreted as market equilibrium between bullish and bearish forces. The subsequent decline indicates that this balance has broken down. Whether this signals the start of a prolonged bearish phase or a temporary reset will likely depend on future liquidity conditions, investor demand, and broader macroeconomic developments. BCMI Breakdown Points To Structural Weakness In Bitcoin Market The CryptoQuant report highlights a notable deterioration in Bitcoin’s Combined Market Index (BCMI), suggesting a shift away from mid-cycle consolidation toward a more defensive market regime. According to the analysis, the mid-cycle equilibrium around the 0.5 level failed to hold, with no meaningful rebound emerging from the 0.3 zone. Instead, the index continued declining directly toward the low 0.2 range without the type of expansion reset typically seen during healthier corrective phases. This pattern differs from past mid-cycle cooling periods and increasingly resembles a transition into a risk-off market environment. Historical comparisons provide additional perspective. Previous cycle bottoms generally formed when BCMI reached approximately 0.10–0.15, notably during 2019 and again in the 2022–2023 bear phase. Current readings remain above those capitulation levels, implying that while Bitcoin may already be operating within a bearish structural framework, full capitulation conditions have not yet materialized. Because BCMI aggregates valuation metrics such as MVRV, profitability indicators like NUPL, spending behavior via SOPR, and broader sentiment measures, its decline into the low 0.2 range reflects shrinking unrealized profits, rising realized losses, deteriorating sentiment, and ongoing valuation compression. Unless the index stabilizes and reclaims the 0.4–0.5 zone, the probability of continued structural weakness remains elevated.

Price has now retreated toward the mid-$60,000 range, placing BTC below shorter-term trend averages and signaling weakening bullish momentum. This shift suggests the market is transitioning from consolidation toward a more defensive phase. The chart shows a clear sequence of lower highs since the late-cycle peak near the $120,000 region. A pattern often associated with corrective or transitional market environments. Recent declines have been accompanied by elevated trading volume. Typically indicative of distribution or forced deleveraging rather than gradual profit-taking. Such dynamics often increase volatility while complicating sustained recovery attempts.

This region aligns with prior consolidation phases and high-liquidity trading zones that historically attracted demand. Holding above this level could allow Bitcoin to stabilize and potentially form a base for sideways consolidation. However, a decisive breakdown would raise the probability of deeper retracement scenarios. Bitcoin’s direction remains closely tied to liquidity conditions, institutional flows, and broader macro sentiment influencing risk assets. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Shiba Inu At Risk of 70% Decline? Price Breaks Below Parallel Channel",
    "body": "An analyst has pointed out how Shiba Inu’s break below the support line of a Parallel Channel could open the door to a target of $0.00000138. Shiba Inu Has Fallen Under Parallel Channel Support In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a technical analysis (TA) pattern that Shiba Inu has seemingly broken out of recently. The pattern in question is a “Parallel Channel,” which is a type of consolidation channel that forms whenever an asset’s price trades between two parallel trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Social Sentiment Stays Bearish Even As Price Recovers From $60,000 Drop The upper level of the pattern is likely to be a source of resistance, while the lower one that of support. If the price manages to escape either of these boundaries, then it may be likely to experience a sustained move in that direction. Parallel Channels come in a few variants. Channels that have their lines sloped upward are known as Ascending Channels, while those with trendlines pointing down are called Descending Channels. In the context of the current topic, the third and simplest type of Parallel Channels is of interest: a channel that is parallel to the time-axis. This type of Parallel Channel corresponds to a phase of true sideways movement in the asset. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the weekly price of Shiba Inu was stuck inside for the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day price of Shiba Inu retested the upper level of the Parallel Channel twice in 2024, but each time, the memecoin found rejection. During 2025, the cryptocurrency mostly consolidated near the midline of the channel, but the decline during the last quarter of the year meant that the coin plummeted toward the support line. With bearish price action continuing in 2026, the asset retested the level, but it failed to find a rebound and slipped right past it. This could be a potential sign that the memecoin is now breaking under the channel. As mentioned before, Parallel Channel breakouts can lead to sustained moves in the direction of the break. Such moves may end up being of the same length as the height of the channel. Based on this, Martinez has highlighted the $0.00000138 level, noting that the breakout could have opened the door to it. From the current SHIB price, this level is situated around 77% lower. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Selloff Continues As Supply Share Drops Under 75% It now remains to be seen how Shiba Inu will develop in the near future, considering this development in its weekly chart.

    "body": "Standard Chartered lowered its long-term outlook for Bitcoin (BTC) for the second time in less than three months as the cryptocurrency market appears to have entered a new bearish cycle. With the leading cryptocurrency currently consolidating below the key $70,000 level, the bank now warns that the asset could fall as low as $50,000 before staging a recovery. Standard Chartered Cuts Bitcoin Target to $100,000 In a note published Thursday, Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets research, said the bank now expects Bitcoin to reach $100,000 by the end of 2026. The latest figure marks a significant reduction from its previous $150,000 projection for BTC. The revision follows an earlier downgrade in December, when the bank cut its target from an ambitious $300,000. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Already Pricing A US Recession? Analyst Sees Major Risk‑Reward Setup According to Bloomberg’s report on the matter, the bank’s more cautious stance reflects a combination of weakening macroeconomic conditions and shifting investor behavior, especially over the past month’s downtrend. The leading cryptocurrency has declined more than 40% from its October peak toward current trading prices of around $67,160, while the US spot Bitcoin exchange‑traded funds (ETFs) sector has seen nearly $8 billion in net outflows. Kendrick noted that slowing US economic momentum and reduced expectations for Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts have weighed heavily on digital assets. In particular, declining ETF holdings have removed what had been a critical source of demand during previous rallies. The interest‑rate environment remains a central concern. Markets have pushed back expectations for Federal Reserve easing, with investors now anticipating that the first rate cut may come later in the year than previously thought. Kendrick also pointed to uncertainty surrounding future Federal Reserve leadership as an additional factor contributing to Bitcoin caution. The bank warned that deteriorating macro conditions and the risk of further investor capitulation could continue to pressure prices in the near term. Ethereum Could Drop To $1,400 Despite the more conservative Bitcoin forecasts, Standard Chartered emphasized that the current downturn appears more orderly than previous crypto market collapses. Kendrick highlighted that on‑chain activity data continues to show improvement, suggesting that underlying network usage remains healthy.

The bank also revised its outlook for Ethereum (ETH). Its 2026 price target for the second‑largest cryptocurrency was reduced to $4,000 from $7,500. Before reaching that level, analysts expect Ether could fall to around $1,400. Featured image from OpenArt, chart from TradingView.com",

Despite occasional short-term bounces and technical patterns suggesting relief rallies, ongoing declines in network revenue and ecosystem metrics are weighing on investor confidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Already Be Entering Crypto Winter, Researchers Warn According to live market data, HBAR is trading near $0.094, with a market capitalization of $3.9 billion and a 24-hour trading volume that reflects modest activity at current price levels. HBAR's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: HBARUSD on Tradingview Support Holds, but Trend Weakness Persists Over recent weeks, HBAR’s price action has been largely corrective, with the token moving in a range near its October lows. Analysts tracking the charts note that while the $0.088–$0.09 zone continues to act as support, the broader trend remains bearish as long as HBAR trades below key resistance levels at $0.126-$0.177. Some market participants have flagged a potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern forming on shorter-term timeframes, implying a breakout above roughly $0.094–$0.096 could open the door to moves toward $0.12. However, this scenario requires clear confirmation amid limited buying momentum. Technical indicators, such as the relative strength index (RSI), are near oversold levels, but momentum oscillators, such as MACD, remain skewed to the downside. Traders note that until HBAR regains and sustains a move above its 20-day, 50-day, and longer-term moving averages, the structural bias will likely remain negative. Ecosystem Metrics and Revenue Trends Could Influence Hedera’s (HBAR) Price Action Beyond price charts, on-chain ecosystem data suggests cooling activity. Total value locked (TVL) in Hedera’s decentralized finance layer has dropped significantly from mid-2025 highs, and weekly decentralized application revenue has declined sharply over recent weeks. Institutional interest in HBAR-linked products, such as spot exchange-traded funds, has shown limited recent inflows, in contrast to stronger demand seen in other altcoin ETFs. A lack of fresh capital from larger participants could further temper price advances if broader market uncertainty persists.

    "title": "Bitcoin On-Chain Heatmap Shows All Major Metrics In The Red",
    "body": "Some key on-chain indicators are flashing a red signal for Bitcoin, suggesting bearish market conditions for the number one cryptocurrency. Major On-Chain Indicators Are In Red Zone For Bitcoin In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Darkfrost has talked about what on-chain indicators are suggesting for the current Bitcoin market. The analyst has shared a heatmap that shows the signals 10 metrics related to the cryptocurrency are flashing right now. The indicators in the graph are all key on-chain metrics covering different dimensions of the network. For example, the MVRV Z-Score deals with general investor profitability, while the Trader Realized Price and Trader On-chain Profit Margin specifically track the profit-loss status of the short-term holders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Social Sentiment Stays Bearish Even As Price Recovers From $60,000 Drop All the indicators in the heatmap are currently giving a red signal, implying conditions aren’t favorable for a bull market. “As long as that remains the case, it is hard to imagine BTC reaching new highs in the short term,” noted Darkfrost. Red has spread on the heatmap as the cryptocurrency’s price has gone through its bearish price action. A couple of metrics, however, have been bearish since even before the market downturn. The indicators in question are the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse and CryptoQuant Network Activity Index. The former of these tracks the flows occurring between spot and derivatives exchanges. This metric being bearish means that there is a lack of speculative push in the market. From the chart, it’s visible that the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse went red during the drawdown phase from the first half of 2025 and has remained so since then. The CryptoQuant Network Activity Index, gauging the transaction activity occurring on the Bitcoin blockchain, left the bull territory in late 2024. Activity on the network has since mostly maintained at bearish levels, except for a few brief flashes. Most of the other metrics didn’t turn red until the November 2025 price decline. The last metric to go red was the Trader On-Chain Profit Margin, which was green during the January recovery rally, but gave the bear signal after the most recent price plunge. In some other news, the Bitcoin short-term holders have shown signs of loss-taking recently, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has highlighted in an X post. The short-term holder cohort includes the BTC investors who purchased their coins during the past 155 days.

Investors usually transfer their tokens to centralized exchanges when they want to participate in selling, so these loss deposits can be a sign that some short-term holders are capitulating. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $65,300, down more than 2% in the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Ethereum $1,900 Retest Could Decide Next Major Move – Is ETH Preparing For New Lows?",
    "body": "As most of the crypto market retests crucial levels, Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to reclaim a major horizontal area. Some market observers have warned that cryptocurrency could fall to new lows if the price doesn’t bounce soon. Related Reading: LayerZero (ZRO) Soars 40% Amid Zero Blockchain Debut, Major Institutional Backing Ethereum Weekly Close On Sight On Thursday, Ethereum dropped 1.4% to retest a key area for the second consecutive day. After hitting a 10-month low of $1,747, the King of Altcoins bounced more than 15% to trade between $2,000 and $2,150 over the past few days. However, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap failed to hold the crucial $2,000 horizontal barrier on Wednesday and tested the $1,900 mark for the first time in a week. After attempting to reclaim the key psychological level in the early hours of Thursday, Ethereum was rejected toward the recent lows, briefly falling below it. Analyst Ted Pillows highlighted the importance of ETH’s current zone, as it has previously triggered major moves. To him, if the altcoin fails to reclaim the $2,000 area in the coming days, a full retrace toward the recent lows should be expected soon. Similarly, market observer Crypto Busy noted that the cryptocurrency is currently trading above a major long-term support. According to the post, the recent correction has sent Ethereum toward a three-year rising support line, which “will decide the next big move.” The analyst warned that “If the trendline breaks with strong weekly closes below $1,900, the structure weakens.” Therefore, ETH must hold its current levels in the coming days to avoid a weekly close below this level. Otherwise, its price could drop “into the next liquidity pockets around $1,600 and possibly $1,300, where the next historical support zones exist.” Is ETH’s ‘Real’ Bull Market Two Years Away? Trader AlejandroXBT shared a potential macro-outlook for Ethereum that suggests the cryptocurrency could still see another major shakeout: My thesis is that the major bullish move that began around 2019–2020 has transitioned into a large and prolonged macro correction, and that Ethereum has been consolidating within this broader corrective structure ever since. He outlined four phases for the macro structure: the pump, the correction, the shakeout, and the moon. The initial phase, which occurred between 2019 and 2021, marked “the true impulsive bullish move,” with strong trend expansion and increasing momentum. According to the market observer, the strong rally that followed the 2022 bear market appears to be a “counter-trend move within a broader corrective range” rather than a renewed bull market and the start of a new long-term cycle. As he explained, ETH’s range-bound behavior signals distribution and consolidation instead of continuation. “From this perspective, the apparent bull market that developed within the correction can be interpreted as a dead cat bounce, a technically strong bounce occurring inside a larger corrective structure,” he affirmed. Related Reading: XRP Positioned For Major Structure Shift As Price Tests Critical Level Therefore, the current macro structure would suggest that a final shakeout phase could “still be required to fully reset sentiment and liquidity before Ethereum can transition into a new impulsive bullish cycle.” Based on this, the trader anticipated a final liquidity-driven move to the downside in the coming months, followed by “the moon” phase, potentially next year, when “the structure suggests the conditions for a true long-term bullish continuation, with price discovery and expansion well beyond previous highs.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "JPMorgan Keeps Bitcoin Bull Case: $266,000 Remains The Target",
    "body": "JPMorgan is sticking with its long-run bitcoin upside framework, including a $266,000 per-coin target, even as the bank flags near-term stress signals around mining economics and still-chilly risk sentiment heading into 2026. The bank’s latest read hinges on two pillars: a “soft” floor around bitcoin’s production cost, and a valuation model that maps bitcoin’s potential market cap against private-sector gold investment on a volatility-adjusted basis. In the near term, JPMorgan frames the current drawdown as a familiar stress test for miners. The bank estimates the cost to produce a bitcoin at roughly $77,000, while bitcoin was trading around the mid-$60,000s in the same analysis window, putting spot below breakeven for less efficient operators. JP Morgan Remains Bullish On Bitcoin Historically, JPMorgan argues, production cost tends to behave like “soft” support rather than a hard line. The mechanism is reflexive: if prices stay below profitability for long enough, weaker miners shut down, difficulty adjusts lower, and the average cost of production falls, effectively tightening the band that previously sat above spot. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Crash Toward $60,000 Was “Necessary” The bank also keeps its broader market tone constructive for 2026, leaning on the idea that institutional capital (not retail or corporate treasuries) is the marginal buyer that can restart flows when the macro backdrop stabilizes. As JPMorgan put it: “We are positive on the outlook for 2026 and expect increased inflows into digital assets, driven by institutional investors.” JPMorgan’s $266,000 target is not pitched as a 2026 “call,” but as the mathematical end point of a gold-parity thought experiment. In the bank’s model, matching the scale of private gold investment (roughly $8 trillion, excluding central banks) implies a bitcoin price around $266,000, a level the analysts themselves described as “unrealistic” in the near term. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Leading On-Chain Analyst Sees A Floor Forming The bridge between “unrealistic now” and “possible later,” in JPMorgan’s framing, is volatility. The bank has pointed to a bitcoin-to-gold volatility ratio around 1.5, unusually low by historical standards and argues that gold’s surge since October alongside rising gold volatility has improved bitcoin’s relative appeal over the long run. “The large outperformance of gold vs. bitcoin since last October coupled with the sharp rise in gold volatility has led to bitcoin looking even more attractive compared to gold over the long term,” the analysts wrote. JPMorgan’s stance effectively splits the tape into two timeframes: a messy adjustment process if bitcoin remains below mining breakevens, and a longer-duration bet that institutional inflows and regulatory progress in the US can reprice the asset’s role versus gold as 2026 unfolds. At press time, BTC traded at $66,229. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin’s $2.3 Billion Wipeout Marks Harshest Crash In 4 Years: Analysts",
    "body": "The recent slide of Bitcoin has punched a hole in short-term holders’ wallets and left loud questions about where prices might settle next. Markets are jittery; people who bought high are taking losses. Some sellers reacted fast, and that rush shows up in on-chain numbers. Related Reading: Is XRP About To Surprise The Market? Finance Expert Weighs In Realized Losses Hit Historical Levels According to CryptoQuant and an analyst writing under the name IT Tech, Bitcoin’s seven-day average of realized net losses climbed to about $2.3 billion — a figure that puts this sell-off among the largest loss events on record. “This is one of the largest capitulation events in BTC history, rivaling the 2021 crash, 2022 Luna/FTX collapse, and mid-2024 correction,” IT Tech said. This spike in losses means many traders sold at a loss over the span of a week, not just a day. Price Action And Market Context Reports say Bitcoin fell sharply from its recent peak and has been bouncing between support lines that traders watch closely. After topping near $126,000, the token traded as low as about $60,000 earlier in the month and has been seen around $66,600 on recent checks. That gap is large, and it explains why panic selling pushed realized losses so high. Signs Pointing To Capitulation Reports note that on-chain indicators tied to profit and loss show losses are rising faster than gains. One contributor at CryptoQuant, GugaOnChain, flagged a Z-Score reading that he describes as consistent with deep capitulation — a phase where more holders give up than buy. When that happens, markets often become chaotic first and steady later. What Analysts Are Saying Now Reports say some market commentators expect pressure to continue for a while. Nic Puckrin, an investment analyst, described the market as being in “full capitulation mode,” and warned selling could persist for months before clearer footing appears. Others point out that heavy losses can also clear the way for patient buyers later. Where Bottoms Have Lived Before Reports have disclosed that CryptoQuant’s measure of the “realized price” sits near $55,000 — a level that has been linked in past cycles to the end of big sell-offs and the start of sideways consolidation. That does not mean a floor has formed this time; it only marks a region where past buyers, on average, stopped losing money on their holdings. Markets have traded well below similar marks before they steadied, so history offers patterns, not guarantees.

Some days will bring sharp rallies that reverse quickly. Other days will drag, and realized losses may keep rising as more investors pull out. Longer term, if institutional demand returns or big holders stop forcing sales, price stability could follow. Right now the market is clearing out positions and testing whether support levels hold.

    "title": "Cardano Founder Hoskinson Warns Of 90-180 Days Of Pain Ahead: Here’s Why",
    "body": "Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson says the crypto market is headed for “90–180 days” of more grind, not because the industry lacks catalysts, but because retail is exhausted and the narrative that kept people engaged has stopped working. Speaking with CoinDesk at Consensus 2026 in Hong Kong, the Input Output CEO framed the current drawdown as a morale problem as much as a market one. “This one particularly stings because we expected a really strong cycle in 2025 and we didn’t quite get it,” he said. “So, a lot of people are pretty bitter about it… We just got to get through the next 90-180 days. It’s going to be tough.” Cardano Founder On What Went Wrong For Crypto Hoskinson’s core point was that crypto has spent years promising a near-term “magic fix,” then watching the market fail to respond even when those fixes arrived. He rattled off the sequence retail has lived through: NFT mania, the collapse of Luna, collapse of FTX, the “scary Gary era,” memecoin mania, and “all the Trump stuff” and argued that each cycle offered the same story: endure the pain now, because something big is coming in 6–12 months. “And we got all the mcguffins,” he said. “We got BlackRock coming in. We got the US government doing the reserve thing. We got good regulation with Genius to start… all the things that we were looking for happened and then nothing happened afterwards.” Related Reading: Cardano May Be At A Prime Buying Point, Analyst Says To explain the mood, Hoskinson leaned on a vivid travel metaphor: “We got to the town and the hotel was closed, the restaurants closed and we’re like where do we sleep and eat? … people are deeply frustrated.” That frustration, in his telling, has turned into a broader disengagement. Retail isn’t shocked by volatility, it’s bored and worn down by the repeated promise that the next institutional wave, the next regulatory milestone, or the next narrative pivot will make the market “work” again. Hoskinson also cast the next phase of adoption as politically contentious inside crypto itself. As more traditional finance players get involved, he warned of a future where the industry becomes “federated”, dominated by large corporate-controlled networks and where users are pushed away from self-custody. “What they want to do long term is move everybody into a custodial holder from a non-custodial holder and then ban DeFi and non-custodial wallets so they can consolidate the entire industry to like 10 or 15 of big actors,” he said, adding that it’s feeding apathy among long-time participants. He put it more bluntly a moment later: “We didn’t sign up to have Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and BlackRock and these other guys run the industry. We signed up to build a new banking system that is pushing power to the edges.” If the industry drifts back into the hands of the institutions crypto originally positioned itself against, Hoskinson argued, the last decade of risk-taking starts to look like a round trip. How To Make Crypto Great Again Hoskinson’s proposed reset centers on making crypto usable for people who aren’t primarily there to trade. That starts with “wallet abstraction”, reducing onboarding to something like “30 seconds with a fingerprint and a pin code,” plus social recovery and then integrating those wallets into mainstream platforms so the default experience becomes non-financial. Related Reading: Cardano Nears End Of 2020-Style Correction: Is $5 To $10 Next? “Right now, I have to understand… private keys, understand how to back up wallets, all this stuff,” he said. “So, really, the only interface is for people that are doing this for financial reasons.” From there, he argued, crypto should stop “over financializing everything,” pointing to the volume of token launches as a symptom. “Anytime I hear anything, I always ask, ‘When’s the token launch?’ And I’m sorry, 11 million tokens went out last year. It’s not sustainable,” he said. He tied that thesis to what he sees as the next wave of demand: agentic AI. By 2030, Hoskinson predicted, “the majority of internet searches in commerce will be agentic,” meaning bots transact more than humans and crypto, via stablecoins and standards he referenced such as x402 becomes the rails that give those agents “economic agency.” Hoskinson also dismissed the idea that quantum fears are driving today’s downturn. “If there are, they’re stupid,” he said of anyone selling Bitcoin due to quantum risk, calling the threat “not… right now.” He pointed instead to DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (QBI), saying the effort is working toward measuring whether quantum computers will be meaningful “by 2033,” and argued the real issue is trade-offs: post-quantum cryptography is “5 to 10 times less efficient,” and few networks want to pay that cost today. Still, he framed the looming transition as an opportunity, especially for Bitcoin, which he said may need a hard fork to fully address post-quantum migration. For Cardano, he argued, on-chain governance makes such changes a more bounded process: “It’s a six-month conversation for us.” At press time, Cardano traded at $0.2638.

Truth Social Funds, an affiliate of Trump Media, has submitted a registration statement to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking approval to launch two new cryptocurrency exchange‑traded funds (ETFs). Trump Media Latest Crypto Proposal The filings outline plans for Crypto.com’s native token, Cronos (CRO), the Cronos Yield Maximizer ETF, and the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Lowers Bitcoin Forecast: Predicts Price Dive To $50,000 Before Rebound The Cronos-focused product is designed to provide exposure to CRO, the native token of the Cronos blockchain, while also capturing staking rewards associated with holding the asset. The second fund would track the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value, and incorporate Ether staking yields into its strategy. Under the proposed structure, Crypto.com would play a central operational role. The digital asset platform is set to provide custody, liquidity, and staking services for the funds. Meanwhile, Yorkville America Equities has been named as the investment adviser, with the filings indicating a 0.95% annual management fee. Bitcoin Struggles Below $70,000 Friday’s announcement builds on a broader strategic partnership formed last year between Trump Media and Crypto.com. As part of that agreement, Trump Media was set to acquire 684.4 million Cronos (CRO) tokens at an approximate price of $0.153 per token. The transaction was structured as a 50% stock and 50% cash exchange and included the creation of a Trump Media Group CRO Strategy aimed at integrating Cronos into the company’s broader digital asset plans.

    "title": "Historical Pattern From 2017 Signals Bitcoin Price Crash To $35,000",
    "body": "Bitcoin is still playing out a series of price actions that look like they may be entering a deeper correction phase. A technical analysis shared on social media platform X by crypto analyst Chiefy suggests that Bitcoin is repeating the macro structures seen after the 2017 and 2021 cycle tops. If the pattern continues to unfold with similar symmetry, the projection is that Bitcoin could fall to as low as $35,000 within days. Bitcoin Imitating 2017 And 2021 Cycle Structures Chiefy’s chart compares three major peaks: the $21,000 high in 2017, the $69,000 peak in 2021, and the recent all-time high just above $126,000. The important trend is that in both of the first two cases, Bitcoin experienced severe retracements exceeding 70% before eventually finding long-term bottoms. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Crash Toward $60,000 Was “Necessary” The first retracement kicked off just after Bitcoin broke above $21,000 in 2017, when it fell 84% during the 2018 bear market. After the $69,000 peak in 2021, the decline reached about 77%. Chiefy described the fractal alignment as nearly perfect, raising the possibility that the market could be approaching another capitulation phase similar to past cycles. The current correction from $126,000 is beginning to resemble those earlier downturns in structure. If Bitcoin were to repeat a similar percentage drop, price projections would place the cryptocurrency in the $30,000 to $35,000 range. The analyst goes even further, warning that such a move could unfold within the next 10 days if the pattern were to play out as it did before. Weak ETF Demand And Whale Inflows Adding To Bearish Pressure Various on-chain data are pointing to a cautious outlook among crypto investors. According to Glassnode, the 30-day simple moving average of net flows for both Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs has been negative for most of the last 90 days. This shows that there is currently no clear sign of demand strong enough to absorb the persistent selling pressure. Related Reading: Important Bitcoin Macro Cycle Durations You Should Know About Interestingly, CryptoQuant’s Whales Inflow Signal metric shows that the average monthly inflows of BTC to Binance from whales increased massively as Bitcoin fell from $95,000 to $60,000. These inflows rose from around 1,000 BTC in late January to nearly 3,000 BTC in February, with a notable spike of roughly 12,000 BTC on February 6 alone. Since February 1, seven trading days have recorded more than 5,000 BTC in daily inflows from this group of large investors. This type of movement shows an intensification of transfers to exchanges from large Bitcoin holders into Binance, a trend that undoubtedly contributed to the price crash. This is because rising exchange inflows are a reflection of increasing selling pressure. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $66,015, down by 1.7% in the past 24 hours.

    "title": "After 95% Crash, Avalanche Forms High-Timeframe Reversal Structure",
    "body": "After enduring a brutal 95%+ drawdown from its 2021 peak, Avalanche is now showing early signs of a potential high-timeframe reversal. With price stabilizing at macro support and forming an emerging Elliott Wave structure on the weekly chart, the current phase could mark a critical turning point in the broader cycle. Weekly Elliott Wave Structure Signals Macro Inflection AVAX is currently forming an Elliott Wave structure on the weekly chart, trading within a massive descending channel that has remained intact since the 2021 all-time high. The broader structure suggests the asset is still operating within a long-term corrective phase, but key technical signals now point to a potential higher-timeframe inflection point. Related Reading: Avalanche Shows Signs Of Recovery As Key Indicator Flashes A Buy Signal – Details According to Crypto Patel, after enduring a brutal 95%+ cycle correction, Avalanche appears to have completed Wave 1 with a macro low near $5.67. Price is now transitioning into the early stages of a Wave 2 recovery phase, a critical moment in the Elliott Wave sequence that often determines whether a sustainable expansion phase can follow. Structurally, the weekly chart shows several notable developments. Wave 1 seems to have finalized within the $8–$5 macro bottoming zone, establishing a potential base of support. At the same time, price continues to trade within the long-term descending channel that has defined the broader downtrend. Technically, the chart reflects a clean bearish breakdown followed by a retest of the lower trendline, a classic deviation setup. Additionally, AVAX executed a liquidity sweep into the weekly demand zone between $8 and $7. Meanwhile, the overall fractal structure also mirrors the compression phase seen in the previous cycle before expansion. For confirmation, Crypto Patel emphasizes the need for sustained weekly strength and expansion back toward mid-channel resistance. A decisive push in that direction would strengthen the bullish Wave 2 thesis and signal that the larger recovery structure is beginning to unfold. Avalanche Upside Roadmap: $33 To $147 In Focus CryptoPatel outlines an ambitious upside roadmap for Avalanche, projecting sequential targets at $33, $58, $97, and ultimately $147. Should the broader channel expansion scenario play out into 2026–2027, price could trend toward the upper boundary of the multi-year descending channel. From the macro bottom to the final target, that would represent an estimated 2,489% expansion. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Defies Bear Market With Explosive On‑Chain Growth, Messari The bullish thesis remains intact as long as Avalanche holds above $5.50 on a weekly final support, which marks the Wave 1 low and last major structural support. Maintaining this level preserves the higher-timeframe recovery structure and keeps the Wave 2 continuation scenario in play. However, a confirmed weekly close below $5.50 would invalidate the setup and signal structural weakness. As it stands, this remains a high-timeframe, patience-driven opportunity with asymmetric risk-to-reward, a framework best suited for spot accumulation and long-term holders.

    "title": "Ethereum Derivatives Reset Raises Questions About Next Price Move: What Happens Next?",
    "body": "Ethereum continues to struggle below the $2,000 level, reflecting persistent selling pressure and increasingly fragile market sentiment. The inability to reclaim this psychological threshold has kept traders defensive, with volatility elevated and confidence weakened as negative sentiment spreads across the broader crypto market. While corrections are not unusual after strong cycles, the current environment shows clear signs of stress, with investors closely watching liquidity conditions and derivatives positioning for clues about the next directional move. Related Reading: Bitcoin BCMI Drops Toward Bear Market Territory: How Close Is BTC To A Real Buy Zone? A recent CryptoQuant report provides additional context by highlighting a significant contraction in Ethereum futures open interest. Data tracking the 30-day change in net open interest across major trading platforms indicates that the derivatives market is undergoing a clear phase of deleveraging and risk readjustment. The decline appears concentrated on key exchanges such as Binance, Gate.io, OKX, and Bybit, pointing to a widespread outflow of capital from leveraged positions. According to the figures, Binance alone recorded an approximate drop of 40 million ETH in open interest over the past month, while Gate.io saw a decline exceeding 20 million ETH. OKX posted a reduction of nearly 6.8 million ETH, with Bybit contributing roughly 8.5 million ETH, bringing the combined contraction across these platforms to around 75 million ETH. Broad Deleveraging Suggests Ethereum Market Reset The CryptoQuant report further notes that when additional platforms showing negative open interest readings are included — even those with comparatively smaller volumes — the total contraction across all exchanges exceeds 80 million ETH over the past 30 days. This confirms that the deleveraging trend is not isolated to a handful of major venues but represents a broader structural shift across the Ethereum derivatives ecosystem. Such a widespread decline in open interest typically indicates that traders, particularly those relying on leverage, are reducing exposure rather than initiating new speculative positions. This behavior may reflect caution following heightened volatility or pressure from recent price declines that triggered margin adjustments. Historically, similar environments tend to emerge during transitional market phases, when speculative momentum cools, and risk management becomes a priority. From a structural standpoint, this type of contraction can function as a market “clean-up.” By gradually removing weaker leveraged positions, the likelihood of sudden liquidation cascades may diminish over time. While this does not guarantee an immediate recovery, flushing out excess leverage often stabilizes market conditions. In Ethereum’s case, the ongoing reset in derivatives positioning could help establish a firmer price base if broader liquidity conditions and investor sentiment begin to stabilize. Related Reading: Ethereum Endures Historic Liquidation Week: Largest Sustained Liquidation Phase Since 2021 Ethereum Faces Structural Pressure Below Key Weekly Support Ethereum’s weekly chart shows persistent downside pressure after losing the $2,000 level, a zone that previously acted as both psychological support and a technical pivot during prior consolidation phases. The recent breakdown places ETH below several major moving averages, which now function as overhead resistance rather than support, indicating weakening bullish momentum and a shift toward a more defensive market structure. Price action reflects a clear rejection from the $3,000–$3,500 region earlier in the cycle, followed by a sequence of lower highs. This pattern typically signals a corrective or transitional phase rather than a continuation of the prior bullish trend. The latest decline has also been accompanied by elevated trading volume, suggesting distribution and deleveraging rather than organic accumulation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Losses Hit Luna Crash Levels — But Price Context Points To A Different Market Phase From a structural standpoint, the next meaningful support area appears near the $1,600–$1,700 range, where prior consolidation and demand previously emerged. Holding this zone would help maintain the broader long-term framework despite current weakness. A sustained break below it, however, could increase the probability of a deeper retracement phase. Ethereum remains highly sensitive to macro liquidity conditions, derivatives positioning, and overall crypto market sentiment, with recovery dependent on renewed demand and stabilization above key technical levels.

    "title": "Bitcoin Flirts With ‘Undervalued’ As MVRV Slides Toward 1",
    "body": "Bitcoin is nearing a level on the MVRV ratio that historically lines up with market “undervaluation,” according to CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Dan, as traders look for signs that a four-month drawdown from October 2025’s all-time high is shifting from distribution into accumulation. Is Bitcoin Undervalued? In a post on X, Korean Dan said Bitcoin is “approaching the undervalued zone,” arguing that the market is getting close to a threshold that has often marked compelling risk-reward for longer-horizon buyers. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Leading On-Chain Analyst Sees A Floor Forming “After reaching its all-time high in October 2025, Bitcoin has been declining for approximately 4 months and is now approaching the undervalued zone,” he wrote. “Generally speaking, when the MVRV ratio falls below 1, Bitcoin is considered to be undervalued. The current value is around 1.1, which can be seen as being close to the undervalued zone.” The MVRV framing matters because the metric has tended to compress toward 1 around prior cycle lows. The chart shared alongside the post shows the ratio at roughly 1.10, with earlier sub-1.0 dips highlighted around past bottoming windows. Crypto Dan cautioned that traders shouldn’t assume the current setup will rhyme perfectly with prior drawdowns, specifically because the preceding advance looked different on valuation measures. “ However, unlike previous cycles, it is necessary to recognize that in this cycle, Bitcoin did not sharply rise all the way into the overvalued zone during the uptrend,” he wrote. “Accordingly, the pattern of the decline may also appear differently from the previous bottom zones, so it seems prudent to prepare for that possibility in our response.” That caveat became the focal point of a short back-and-forth in replies. One user, onlyus8x, suggested that if Bitcoin reached this cycle’s prior all-time high more than three times faster than before, the downturn could also resolve faster—“might the winter also pass 3 times faster?” Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Luna-Level Capitulation Signal at $67K, Not $19K Crypto Dan pushed back on a simple speed analogy, replying: “Because there are differences from your past, I personally set the criteria differently from past decline cycles by comprehensively judging these things as well.” Mayer Multiple And The 200-Week MA A separate post from analyst Will Clemente pointed to two long-watched, price-based benchmarks that are also pressing into historically constructive ranges. “Throughout Bitcoin’s life span we have seen two indicators continue to be the best global market bottom signals: The Mayer multiple (distance from 200 day moving average) and the 200 week moving average,” Clemente wrote. “Both of these are clearly in long term accumulation territory.” The charts he shared show a Mayer Multiple around 0.60, alongside a backtest table that flags prior instances when the indicator fell to roughly that level. The same image placed Bitcoin’s 200-week moving average near $57,926, with Bitcoin shown about 15% above it and a note that it has “not yet touched” that line in the current drawdown. At press time, BTC traded at $67,277. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",
