    "title": "5,606 Bitcoin: Lightning Network Sets Fresh Capacity Record",
    "body": "Lightning Network capacity hit a new high this week as major exchanges put more Bitcoin into off-chain channels, boosting the network’s total liquidity and changing how users move BTC. Related Reading: Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund Exchange Support Drives Capacity According to reports, the Lightning Network’s public capacity climbed to about 5,606 BTC, with some trackers briefly showing a peak near 5,637 BTC. That is a clear uptick from earlier levels and marks the highest recorded total so far. Exchanges including Binance and OKX have been named as contributors that added Bitcoin to Lightning channels, and other platforms such as Kraken and Bitfinex are expanding their support as well. These deposits are aimed at speeding up deposits and withdrawals and cutting fees for customers. Network Activity Vs. Public Nodes Based on reports, that increase in capacity has not been matched by a big rise in the number of public nodes or channels. Public node counts sit near 14,940, while public channels are roughly 48,678. In other words, more Bitcoin is available inside the network, but the number of hands handling traffic has not jumped in the same way. Some of this extra liquidity is concentrated in larger, custodial channels run by exchanges, which can move big sums without creating many new public routes. That makes on-chain metrics a bit harder to read. Transaction counts and on-chain fee savings do show real user benefits, even when the node graph looks stable. A separate figure that shows real usage is the share of exchange traffic routed over Lightning. Based on reports, one exchange has routed around 15% of its Bitcoin transactions via Lightning rails after adopting Lightning integrations, pointing to meaningful operational changes at major platforms. New Use Cases And Funding Funding and protocol work are following capacity growth. Tether led a round that raised about $8 million for a startup focused on payments over Lightning, indicating interest in stablecoin flows on the network. Announcing Taproot Assets v0.7, now with reusable addresses, a fully auditable asset supply, and larger, more reliable transactions. ✅ With this release, we are laying the foundation for trillions of dollars to flow on bitcoin and Lightning. 💸 Read more below. Upgrade today! — Lightning Labs⚡️🌐 (@lightning) December 16, 2025 Protocol upgrades — including work around Taproot-related asset handling and reliability improvements — are also being rolled out to support more varied payments and token types. These developments point to Lightning being used for things beyond tiny tips: remittances, merchant payments, and stablecoin transfers are being tested more widely. Related Reading: TechCrunch Founder Names XRP Among His Largest Crypto Positions Market watchers say this mix of exchange liquidity, developer upgrades, and rising on-platform usage could make Lightning a more practical rail for everyday BTC movement. Some critics warn that heavier reliance on custodial channels raises centralization risks and reduces the visibility of true peer-to-peer routing. Others note that improved user experience, lower costs, and faster finality are what ordinary users will notice first. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has revealed the next Bitcoin price level he is looking to accumulate at in anticipation of a relief rally. Despite plans to buy BTC, the analyst indicated that he is still bearish on the flagship crypto in the long term, with a larger decline expected to unfold. Analyst Reveals The Next Buy Level As Bitcoin Price Eyes Bounce In an X post, Doctor Profit stated that he is buying BTC around $86,000 as he looks to trade a short-term relief bounce. He reiterated that he sees the probability of the Bitcoin price revisiting the $97,000 to $107,000 region before the next major leg lower unfolds. The analyst added that this projected move is a 20% from the current region, which presents a good risk-reward trade with a tight stop loss. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Full Technical Bitcoin Price Breakdown – Here’s The Target Doctor Profit is known to have predicted the Bitcoin price top when it was trading at around $126,000. The analyst noted that he remains very bearish in the long term, expecting further declines. As such, he plans to play this move to buy BTC with absolute and the highest form of risk management. The analyst explained that this means he will ensure to place the stop loss at entry once in solid profit, while his short trade from between $115,000 and $125,000 will still be running. Doctor Profit further remarked that this long setup for the Bitcoin price is aimed at a few weeks only, before the bearish price action resumes with lower targets. BTC Remains “Extremely Unstable And Bearish” Doctor Profit stated that the Bitcoin price remains extremely unstable and bearish for the mid-term, noting that a strong downside continuation can happen at any moment, even before the flagship crypto reaches the projected $97,000 to $107,000 zone. The analyst added that a deeper and faster sell-off is absolutely possible, so those looking to buy now should take extreme caution. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Still Hit $140,000? What The Global M2 Money Supply Says Doctor Profit reiterated that his short positions remain fully open, as any upside is treated as distribution and liquidity for the next leg down. The analyst noted that the $70,000 region remains the main target. If the Bitcoin price manages to revisit the $97,000 to $107,000 region, he stated that he would fully take profit again on the position and add the profits to his short position. In the meantime, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has warned that the Bitcoin price needs to hold the $87,000 region or risk dropping to as low as $70,000. BTC is currently on the edge with Japan set to raise its interest rates this week. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $86,600, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Russia Draws Firm Line on Digital Assets, Keeping Crypto Out of Domestic Payments",
    "body": "Russia has reiterated its firm stance on crypto, drawing a clear distinction between digital assets and traditional currency. While global debate continues over whether crypto can coexist with national currencies, Russian lawmakers are reinforcing a long-held view. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Death Cross’ Panic Returns: History Says It’s A Late Signal Inside the country, payments remain the sole domain of the ruble. The position comes as crypto usage grows worldwide and as Russia experiments with alternative settlement tools for cross-border trade under pressure from sanctions. At the center of the latest comments is Anatoly Aksakov, chair of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets and a key figure behind Russia’s crypto legislation. Speaking to state media, Aksakov said there is no ambiguity in the law. BTC's price records some gains on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Lawmakers Reinforce Ruble-only Payment Rule In Russia, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum can be held or traded as investments, but they are not permitted to function as a means of payment in domestic commerce, according to lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov. All payments for goods and services must continue to be settled in rubles. Aksakov’s remarks restate provisions introduced in Russia’s 2020 digital assets law, which removed cryptocurrencies from any form of legal tender. Lawmakers argue that money must be issued and controlled by the state, and private digital currencies do not meet that standard. Officials say there are no plans to soften this stance. The rule applies across retail, online services, and business contracts, closing the door on crypto payments regardless of adoption trends or market conditions. Central Bank Skepticism Shapes Policy The Bank of Russia continues to play a decisive role in this approach. Governor Elvira Nabiullina has long warned that cryptocurrencies pose risks to financial stability and consumer protection. The central bank has consistently opposed using crypto as a medium of exchange and has previously pushed for broad restrictions on exchanges and transactions. This position has led to years of friction with the Ministry of Finance, which favored regulation and taxation over outright limits. While several legislative proposals emerged from that debate, none altered the core prohibition on crypto payments. Today, policymakers appear to be aligned in preserving the ruble’s monopoly. Cross-Border Use Grows Despite Domestic Ban Although crypto is barred from internal payments, Russian authorities acknowledge its growing role in international trade. Businesses are permitted to use digital assets for cross-border settlements under an experimental legal regime, a workaround that has gained traction amid global financial restrictions. Officials estimate that billions of dollars’ worth of trade has already moved through such channels. Similarly, Russia has legalized cryptocurrency mining and is tightening oversight of the sector, underscoring a split strategy, limited use abroad, and strict control at home.

Digital assets may serve as investment tools or external settlement instruments, but inside the country, the ruble remains the only means of payment.

    "title": "Saylor’s Long Bitcoin Bet Has Left Corporate Rivals Behind: Crypto Entrepreneur",
    "body": "Michael Saylor’s firm Strategy continues to make Bitcoin headlines with its enormous purchases, making it one of the largest holders in the world. Related Reading: TechCrunch Founder Names XRP Among His Largest Crypto Positions Reports show the company owns 671,268 Bitcoin, roughly 3.2% of the total supply, valued at about $58.61 billion at the time of publication, according to Saylor Tracker. Bitcoin entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said on his podcast that it would be extremely difficult for any other public company to match Strategy’s buying pace. Massive Holdings And Recent Purchase Strategy announced a fresh buy of 10,645 Bitcoin for $980.3 million, paying an average of $92,098 per coin. That move pushed its total hoard to roughly 3.2% of all Bitcoin in existence. Those are large figures. They also show why rivals would need huge sums to close the gap. Pompliano On The Scale Needed To Compete According to comments made on The Pomp Podcast, Pompliano said that a company trying to match Strategy would have to “raise hundreds of billions of dollars.” He said it would be “very hard to see that happening.” He pointed to Strategy’s early entry in 2020, when Saylor’s initial purchase was about $500 million while Bitcoin traded between $9,000 and $10,000. That initial stake, based on current prices cited in reports, is now worth more than $4.8 billion with Bitcoin trading around $86,950. Market Impact And Buying Method Market watchers have flagged Strategy’s growing share as something to watch. Some worry a single large holder could influence price moves. Others note the firm does most of its buying through over-the-counter desks. OTC trades are used to handle big orders without sending shockwaves through exchange order books. Many investors see the regular, large purchases as a positive sign for Bitcoin demand. Holding Strategy And Influence Concerns Pompliano described 3.2% as “a big number, but it’s also a small number.” He added, “It’s not like they own 10%.” That view captures a split: the holding is large enough to matter for supply dynamics and market psychology, but not so large that it gives absolute control. Still, the combination of size and repeated buys draws attention from traders and regulators alike. Outlook And Long Term Plans Reports quote Strategy’s CEO Phong Lee as saying the company probably won’t sell any Bitcoin until at least 2065. Saylor has also posted that he plans on “buying the top forever.” Those statements reinforce a long-term stance rather than short-term trading. The market tends to treat such commitments as bullish, and many participants adjust expectations for future demand accordingly. Related Reading: Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund A Dominant Buyer With 671,268 Bitcoin on the books and a steady program of purchases, Strategy remains a dominant public buyer. Based on current numbers and public comments, it will be difficult for another listed company to match that level of accumulation without very large capital raises or a dramatic change in corporate behavior. The pace set by Strategy is likely to keep drawing attention from investors watching supply and demand for Bitcoin. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Structure Turns Bearish As Structural Indicators Flip Negative",
    "body": "Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim the $90,000 level as it continues to test critical demand around the $86,000 zone. After weeks of corrective price action, bulls are finding it increasingly difficult to build a convincing case for trend continuation. Related Reading: XRP Liquidity Dries Up: Futures Buy Volume On Binance Falls from $5.8B to $250M Momentum has faded, upside attempts have been rejected, and market confidence is weakening. As a result, a growing number of analysts are beginning to openly discuss the possibility that Bitcoin is transitioning into a broader bear market phase rather than a temporary pullback within a larger uptrend. This shift in narrative is supported by structural data. In a recent analysis, Axel Adler highlights that Bitcoin’s price action is now aligned with a clear deterioration in market structure. His chart, which combines a composite Structure Shift signal with a Donchian Channel, shows that the indicator has decisively moved into negative territory. The Structure Shift composite ranges from -1 to +1, with values below zero signaling bearish regime dominance. Currently, the signal sits near -0.5, a level historically associated with sustained downside pressure rather than short-lived corrections. At the same time, Bitcoin price has dropped to the lower boundary of the 21-day Donchian Channel and is hovering just above the $85,000 support area. Together, these signals suggest that the market is operating in a risk-off environment, where downside risks remain elevated unless structure improves meaningfully. Bitcoin Structure Confirms Bearish Regime Adler notes that the current position of the Structure Shift composite signal confirms Bitcoin has firmly established itself within a bearish structural zone. With the indicator sitting below zero, the market is no longer in a neutral or transitional phase but operating under sustained downside conditions. According to this framework, the primary trigger for improvement would be a decisive recovery of the composite signal back above the zero threshold, ideally while price continues to hold support within the Donchian Channel. Without that shift, any short-term bounce risks remaining corrective rather than trend-changing. This bearish structure is reinforced by Bitcoin’s Bull-Bear market structure index, which focuses on derivatives dynamics through fast and slow regime components. The latest data shows the bullish component collapsing to just 5%, an extremely low reading that reflects the near absence of constructive long-side momentum. At the same time, the fast bearish component has moved deeper into negative territory, signaling rising seller pressure driven primarily by the futures market. This configuration highlights a critical imbalance. Short-term momentum is firmly controlled by bears, while spot demand has so far proven insufficient to absorb derivatives-led selling pressure. For conditions to improve, the bullish component of the index would need to recover meaningfully, signaling renewed participation from buyers. Taken together, both indicators point to the same conclusion: Bitcoin has undergone a local structural shift into bearish territory. The dominant risk remains continued downside pressure driven by derivatives, especially in the absence of strong spot accumulation. Related Reading: Who Really Sold The Dip? On-Chain Data Exposes Bitcoin’s True Sellers Bitcoin Price Tests Critical Support as Downtrend Persists Bitcoin continues to trade under clear downside pressure. The price now hovers around the $86,500 level after failing to reclaim higher resistance zones. The chart highlights a decisive breakdown below the short- and medium-term moving averages. With BTC trading well beneath the 50-day and 100-day averages. These levels, which previously acted as dynamic support during the uptrend, have now flipped into resistance. Reinforcing the bearish market structure. The most notable technical development is Bitcoin’s interaction with the 200-day moving average, shown in red. Price has briefly tested this long-term support but remains fragile, with follow-through buying notably absent. Historically, sustained trading below faster-moving averages while compressing near the 200-day often signals either a prolonged consolidation phase or the risk of an additional leg lower if demand fails to appear.

For bulls to regain control, BTC must first stabilize above current demand and reclaim key moving averages. Signaling that sellers are losing dominance.

    "body": "Ethereum’s (ETH) recent pullback is starting to reflect more than short-term price volatility. As ETH trades below the $3,000 mark, a combination of heavy liquidations, declining network activity, and sustained institutional outflows is reinforcing concerns about weakening demand. Related Reading: Chainlink’s Top Whales Reverse Course, Quietly Scoop Up $263M In LINK While prices have so far held above key support levels, multiple indicators suggest that selling pressure remains firmly in place, leaving the market in a cautious holding pattern. Over the past week, Ethereum has fallen roughly 12%, underperforming several major assets during a broader market correction. The drop pushed ETH briefly toward the $2,850–$2,900 zone, triggering over $200 million in liquidation, one of the largest liquidation events in recent months. ETH's price trends slightly upwards on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Network Activity and Ethereum ETF Flows Signal Waning Participation Beyond price action, Ethereum’s on-chain metrics are showing signs of cooling participation. Weekly active addresses fell from around 440,000 earlier in the quarter to roughly 324,000 in December, marking the lowest level since May. Transaction counts have also dropped to mid-year lows, pointing to reduced engagement from both retail and institutional users. At the same time, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs continue to see persistent outflows. Data from SoSoValue shows more than $224 million exiting ETH ETFs over several consecutive sessions, led primarily by BlackRock’s ETHA fund. Since mid-December, the total net assets across U.S. spot ETH ETFs have declined by more than $3 billion, suggesting that institutions are trimming their exposure rather than adding to positions. The Coinbase Premium Index turning negative further supports the view that U.S.-based selling pressure has returned. Whale Selling and Technical Structure Keep Risks Skewed Lower Large holders have added to near-term pressure. On-chain data shows more than 28,500 ETH sold by a handful of whale wallets within a short period, including transactions exceeding $80 million in total value. Despite this distribution, ETH has so far avoided a sharp breakdown, with buyers repeatedly defending levels near $2,880. From a technical standpoint, Ethereum remains in a medium-term downtrend. Price continues to trade below key moving averages, while momentum indicators such as RSI remain below neutral levels.

    "title": "Dogecoin Breakdown Ahead? Analyst Flags 2022-Style Signal",
    "body": "Dogecoin may be lining up for a deeper breakdown even if Bitcoin manages a short-term bounce, according to pseudonymous analyst VisionPulsed, who argues that a familiar 2022-style pattern is re-emerging across majors and memecoins. In a video published December 16, the analyst frames the near-term setup around Bitcoin’s daily stochastic RSI, which is moving from overbought back toward oversold. Over the past two months, every such reset on the daily chart has coincided with fresh lows in price. This time, he says, the structure is slightly different — and that matters for how Dogecoin trades the next leg. Dogecoin Bull Need To Watch Bitcoin’s Stochastic Reset On Bitcoin, VisionPulsed notes that the daily stochastic RSI is now “approaching oversold” after a stretch at elevated levels. In October, November and early December, similar full cycles from overbought to oversold on the daily timeframe were accompanied by Bitcoin making new lows. “This is actually the first time that the stock RSI is going from overbought to oversold and we may not make a new low,” he says, emphasizing that it is still “too early” to call it. If price instead prints a higher low as the oscillator resets, he argues that would signal a short- to medium-term trend reversal rather than a macro regime change, opening the door for a relief rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Selloff Tests Long-Held Beliefs as Traders Debate Capitulation or Reset “If we do see a higher low form on the price as the stock RSI resets, then you should get the green light for a relief rally,” he adds. If the current low breaks instead, the rally “is down to hell where you belong,” as he puts it, underscoring that the bullish case hinges on that higher-low structure holding on the daily chart. Dogecoin, in his view, is where the setup turns dangerous. While Bitcoin is attempting to carve out a higher low, Dogecoin continues to print lower lows on the same timeframe. VisionPulsed links this to a similar divergence in 2022, when Doge bled lower throughout the month while Bitcoin quietly based and formed higher lows. “Very similar to 2022,” he says, adding that Bitcoin is, as of the recording, making “a higher low even though Dogecoin is not.” That pattern, he argues, suggests Doge could still catch a relief move if Bitcoin rallies, but from a much weaker starting point. How Low Can DOGE Price Go? In such a scenario, he sketches a rally “probably somewhere up here to grab the peanut,” placing that so-called “peanut zone” roughly around the $0.20 area in January. He calls that level “probably your last chance to do whatever you’re going to do” before Dogecoin, in his base case, resumes its downtrend and heads “down to feed the pig pen” — his shorthand for a deeper capitulation move to new lows in the $0.05 to $0.06 area. The base case for Dogecoin is a deeper retracement. He says. “We’re coming down to feed the little piggies. Oink oink.” Until Doge breaks its current downtrend, he sees “no reason to assume it’s bullish.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Rare Weekly RSI Level Seen Only 4 Times In 11 Years The timing, in his framework, is anchored on Bitcoin’s position inside the lower band of a 7–8 day Gaussian channel and the interaction of several moving averages. He notes that Bitcoin has already spent close to four weeks in this “peanut gallery” zone, versus roughly 63 days during the 2022 accumulation period. If Bitcoin is still hovering near the upper range of the current structure by late January, he argues, “you’re pretty much recreating 2022,” which in his view would likely be followed by a capitulation leg lower. A key signal to watch, he says, is the convergence of a white and a green moving average, which in the 2022 template marked the “point of no return before Bitcoin collapsed.” Those lines are now projected to converge in late January or early February. Once they meet, his base case is that Bitcoin gets “sent through the blue moving average” to test a red moving average in the $50,000–$60,000 zone as a minimum downside target. That, in his scenario, is when Dogecoin finally goes down to the $0.05 area. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.12974. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "UK Crypto Ownership Takes Biggest Hit Since 2021, Regulator Says",
    "body": "According to new research commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority, the share of UK adults who hold cryptocurrencies has fallen to 8% in 2025, down from 12% a year earlier. Related Reading: Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund Survey Shows Smaller Numbers Holding Crypto Fieldwork for the FCA study ran from 5th August to 2nd September 2025, using a YouGov online panel to collect a nationally representative sample of 2,353 interviews plus a boosted sample of people who own or previously owned crypto. Awareness of cryptocurrencies remains high at 91%, even as fewer people report owning them. The drop marks the first fall in overall ownership in the last four years, although ownership is still about double the level recorded in 2021. That suggests some people who held small amounts have pulled back while a core of larger holders remains active. Average Holdings Have Increased Reports have disclosed that the mix of holdings has shifted upward. The proportion of holders with crypto worth between £1,001 and £5,000 rose to over 20%, and those with holdings of £5,001 to £10,000 increased to around 10%. At the same time, reported small holdings under £100 have declined. Many users also reported net gains in 2025, with a majority saying their portfolios rose in value over the year. Among people who still hold crypto, Bitcoin is the most common asset at 57%, followed by Ether at 43%. Other tokens are far less widely held, though Solana registers with about 21% of holders. These figures point to concentration in a few large names even as overall participation shrinks. Regulators Move To Tighten Rules The FCA published this research as part of a broader push to bring the sector under clearer rules. The regulator has launched consultations on proposals covering trading platforms, market safeguards and rules for staking, lending and custody. Reports show the consultation process is part of a wider government plan that aims to start formal regulation of cryptoassets by October 2027. What This Means For Markets And Consumers Traders and platforms will likely watch these trends closely. A smaller base of retail owners can mean less retail-driven volatility, but it can also reduce everyday familiarity with crypto in the wider public.

The FCA’s work on clearer rules comes amid growing government attention to market integrity and consumer protection. In short, fewer Britons now report owning crypto, yet those who remain tend to hold larger sums and favor the top coins. The figures from the FCA suggest a market that is thinning at the edges while concentration and regulatory scrutiny rise. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin’s Make-or-Break Phase Begins: Weekly Support Holds, Momentum Fades",
    "body": "Bitcoin has entered a critical make-or-break phase as price clings to key weekly support while momentum continues to fade. Despite holding above a major confluence zone, repeated rejections overhead suggest buyers are losing control. With macro pressure building and liquidity levels still untested, the next move from here could define whether BTC stabilizes or slides into a deeper reset. Lower-Timeframe Rejection Keeps The Downtrend In Control Crypto analyst Michael Van De Poppe revealed in a recent post that Bitcoin has faced a clear rejection at a key resistance level. This failure signals that the short-term downtrend remains intact on lower timeframes, confirming that selling pressure currently outweighs buying momentum in the immediate term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Structure Weakens As Inter-Exchange Liquidity Touches Red Zone – Details To flip this short-term bias, Van de Poppe expects a clear breakout above the $88,000 level. A successful move above this mark would serve as a strong, unequivocal signal to the markets that the corrective phase is over and that upward momentum is likely to take hold from that point forward. If buyers fail to achieve this necessary breakout, it remains highly probable that the price will pursue liquidity targets below, specifically targeting a test at $83,000 for liquidity. Should that fail, a further descent to the $80,000 level will trigger stop-losses. Finally, Van De Poppe connected the technical outlook to the broader economic environment. Given the high volume of macroeconomic events scheduled to take place over the course of the week, such as FOMC, Poppe believes that the market could experience significant volatility and end up reaching one of the predicted downside liquidity tests. $93,000 Rejection Stalls Momentum, but Weekly Structure Still Intact According to a weekly chart update by Crypto Damus, Bitcoin recently faced a firm rejection at the $93,000 resistance level. Despite that setback, price action remains constructive for now, with BTC holding above the crucial $86,000 weekly support zone. This area is reinforced with the key 100-week moving average confluence, making it an important level to watch in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Faces Potential 60% Decline As Expert Warns Of ‘Major Bull Trap’ That said, the broader structure still leaves room for deeper downside. Crypto Damus notes that a full retracement toward the rising wedge breakdown target cannot be ruled out, which aligns closely with the April low around the $78,000 region. A move into that zone would represent a more pronounced corrective phase within the larger cycle. Looking further ahead, a deeper bear-market-style retest may ultimately present a more attractive long-term opportunity. A revisit of the $70,000 level is highlighted as a potential high-conviction buying area, should the market extend its pullback. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $86,450 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it settles above the $87,500 zone. Bitcoin Price Consolidates Losses Bitcoin price attempted a fresh surge above $88,000 and $88,500. BTC tested the $90,000 resistance zone and reacted to the downside. There was a sharp decline below $88,000. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $86,450 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The price even spiked below the $86,000 support. However, the bulls were active near the $85,250 zone. A low was formed at $85,282 and the price recently started an upside correction. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $90,318 swing high to the $85,282 low. The bears are active near $87,000. Bitcoin is now trading below $87,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . If the bulls remain in action, the price could attempt more gains. Immediate resistance is near the $86,800 level. The first key resistance is near the $87,350 level. The next resistance could be $87,800 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $90,318 swing high to the $85,282 low. A close above the $87,800 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $88,000 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $89,200 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $90,000 and $90,500. Another Drop In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $87,800 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $85,500 level. The first major support is near the $85,250 level.

Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $85,500, followed by $85,000. Major Resistance Levels – $87,800 and $88,000.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Could Be Sub-$50,000 By 2028 Without Quantum Fix, Warns Capriole Founder",
    "body": "The founder of Capriole Investments has warned about the Quantum risk to Bitcoin, saying there’s a 34% chance it breaks BTC in the next three years. Bitcoin Could Trade At A Discount If No Quantum Fix Is Deployed As Quantum Computing continues to advance, many in the Bitcoin community have been raising concerns about what a breakthrough could mean for the cryptocurrency. Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has been one of those voices. Related Reading: Chainlink’s Top Whales Reverse Course, Quietly Scoop Up $263M In LINK Last week, Edwards gave a presentation on the Quantum threat to Bitcoin at the Global Blockchain Show in Abu Dhabi. The analyst has also shared some insights on X. According to Edwards, there’s a 34% chance that Quantum will undermine BTC’s cryptography in the next three years. Based on this, the Capriole founder has assigned a 34% discount to BTC today. “Given a 2-3 yr timeline to deploy fix, this is the current discount rate,” noted Edwards. “And it is growing. Every. Single. Day.” The probability has been estimated using seven different sources providing timelines for Quantum Computing breakthroughs. If Capriole’s calculations are to go by, the Quantum threat has a chance of more than 50% to affect blockchain technology by 2030. What will happen in the scenario that Quantum Computing does end up unlocking Bitcoin’s cryptography? Even if wallets today are secured properly, there are still old wallets that can be vulnerable. A chunk of the BTC supply has been dormant for years, and with a Quantum breakthrough, it could potentially find its way back into circulation. The most popular example of dormant holdings is, of course, the ones attributed to the cryptocurrency’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi’s wallets hold a total of 1,096,354 BTC, worth a whopping $95 billion at current prices. All these coins possibly being dumped on the market would naturally have a negative effect on the Bitcoin price. Not just because of the scale involved, but also because of the loss of confidence that such an event would result in. Considering the threat, Capriole has repeatedly stressed that a fix needs to be implemented as soon as possible. So far, the community hasn’t reached a consensus on when or what the solution should be. In an X post, Strategy co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor has also chimed in on the topic. “Quantum computing won’t break Bitcoin—it will harden it,” wrote Saylor. “The network upgrades, active coins migrate, lost coins stay frozen.” In this scenario, the coins attached to Satoshi and other early miners will forever become inaccessible. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum Plunge Triggers Near-$600 Million Crypto Long Flush Edwards has warned that if a solution isn’t implemented in time, the coin may face its biggest bear market in history. “If we haven’t deployed a fix by 2028, I expect Bitcoin will be sub $50K and continue to fall until it’s fixed,” said the Capriole founder. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $86,500, down 5.7% over the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, Capriole.com, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Ethereum price failed to stay above $3,00 0 and declined further. ETH is now consolidating and might soon aim to start a recovery wave if it clears $2,880. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $2,950 zone. The price is trading below $2,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,920 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below the $2,800 zone. Ethereum Price Dips To New Weekly Lows Ethereum price attempted a fresh increase but struggled above $3,000, like Bitcoin . ETH price dipped below $2,950 and $2,920 to enter a bearish zone. The bears even pushed the price below $2,850. A low was formed at $2,790 and the price is now consolidating losses well below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,175 swing high to the $2,790 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,920 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If there is another upward move, the price could face resistance near the $2,880 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,920 level and trend line. The first major resistance is near the $2,980 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,175 swing high to the $2,790 low. A clear move above the $2,980 resistance might send the price toward the $3,030 resistance. An upside break above the $3,030 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,120 resistance zone or even $3,150 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,880 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,800 level. The first major support sits near the $2,780 zone. A clear move below the $2,780 support might push the price toward the $2,740 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,625 region. The next key support sits at $2,550. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone. Major Support Level – $2,780 Major Resistance Level – $2,920",

    "title": "Russia Rejects Crypto As Legal Tender, Finance Official Confirms",
    "body": "According to statements reported by Russian news agencies, Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, said cryptocurrencies “will never become money” in Russia and should be treated only as investment instruments. He said that where a payment is required, it must be made in Russian rubles. Related Reading: Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund Ruble Remains Sole Payment Unit Based on reports, that stance matches existing law. A 2020 federal law on digital financial assets defines digital currency as something different from Russia’s monetary unit and bars its use as a means of payment inside the country. The law treats tokens and classic cryptocurrencies as property or investment items rather than legal tender. Russia Central Bank Concerns Over Stability Officials in Moscow have repeatedly echoed the central bank’s worry that allowing crypto for everyday payments could harm monetary control and financial stability. Regulators say the ruble’s role must be protected, and that volatility in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum makes them unsuitable for regular transactions. Limited Windows For Crypto Use Reports have also noted that while crypto cannot be used to buy goods and services domestically, it can still exist in regulated pockets. Lawmakers and regulators are framing cryptocurrencies as tradable assets, not cash. Some narrow exceptions are being discussed for corporate or cross-border operations under strict rules, but those do not change the basic ban on domestic payments. What The Law Means For People And Business Practical effects are clear. Russian residents and businesses cannot accept digital coins in place of rubles for sales or services. At the same time, individuals can hold, trade, or invest in crypto under the framework that separates ownership from payment rights. The law also requires public officials to declare holdings in digital assets, linking transparency rules to the new regime. Related Reading: 5,606 Bitcoin: Lightning Network Sets Fresh Capacity Record A Narrowing Path Forward Based on reports from several outlets, the political message is firm: payments stay in rubles. Lawmakers are talking about refining rules for trading, custody and reporting, but they are not signalling a shift toward letting cryptocurrencies replace the ruble for daily use. That position keeps Russia on a different track from some countries that permit crypto payments or give coins legal tender status. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "A cryptocurrency analyst has explained where Ethereum could go next based on a long-term Parallel Channel forming in its monthly price chart. Ethereum Has Been Trading Inside A Parallel Channel For The Last Few Years In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a long-term pattern that Ethereum has appeared to have been following for the last few years. The pattern in question is a “Parallel Channel” from technical analysis (TA), which forms whenever an asset’s price trades between two parallel trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Be Sub-$50,000 By 2028 Without Quantum Fix, Warns Capriole Founder The upper level of a Parallel Channel is likely to facilitate top formations in the asset, while the lower one can act as a support boundary and allow the price to remain above it. Parallel Channels can be of a few different types depending on how the lines are oriented with respect to the graph axes. If the channel has some slope, it falls into either the Ascending or Descending categories. Naturally, it’s the former when the lines are angled upward and latter when they are downward. In the context of the current topic, the simplest type of Parallel Channel is of relevance: a channel that has zero slope. That is, a pattern with lines that are parallel to the time-axis. As an asset trades inside such a channel, it experiences consolidation in an exactly sideways manner. If one of the levels of the pattern break, a sustained continuation of trend may occur in that direction. This means that a surge above the resistance can be a bullish signal, while a fall under support a bearish one. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the monthly price of Ethereum has been trading inside for the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the recent bearish wave in Ethereum has meant that its 1-month price has retraced to the midway line of the Parallel Channel located at $2,930. Martinez has noted that if ETH closes December below this level, a decline to lower levels could occur. The next potential support is situated at $2,000, corresponding to the 25% mark of the Parallel Channel. The cryptocurrency found support around this line in the starting months of 2025. In the scenario that this level also fails, Ethereum may be looking at a fall to the bottom line of the Parallel Channel at $1,090. The asset last retested it back in 2022 and successfully found support.

ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $2,860, down over 15% in the last seven days. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Optimism Grows In Crypto Market Structure Bill After Wednesday’s Senate Banking Meeting",
    "body": "On Wednesday, a bipartisan meeting of the Senate Banking Committee, led by Senator Tim Scott, offered a cautiously optimistic outlook for discussions surrounding the anticipated crypto market structure bill. Despite the absence of any markup hearings scheduled for this week, industry representatives and senators engaged in what many considered a productive dialogue regarding the evolving legislative landscape. Senators Collaborate With Industry Leaders Key figures from major crypto firms were among the attendees, including executives from Coinbase (COIN), Kraken, Chainlink, a16z, and Ripple, who have been increasingly involved in discussions aimed at fostering the positive growth of digital assets in the country. According to Eleanor Terret from Crypto In America, the atmosphere of the meeting was described as “constructive and collaborative.” Senators from both parties engaged actively with industry representatives, asking insightful questions and exploring the nuances of the proposed bill text. Related Reading: Cantor Fitzgerald Projects Major Growth For Hyperliquid (HYPE) In Explosive New Report Participating senators included Democrats Mark Warner and Catherine Cortez Masto, who were noted for their engagement and for posing significant questions to both the industry representatives and Senate Banking staff. Three key areas of ongoing negotiation emerged from the discussions: the classification of tokens—distinguishing between securities and commodities, the roles of stablecoin interest versus rewards, and discussions surrounding decentralized finance (DeFi). The meeting’s update follows earlier confirmation from a committee spokesperson that the Banking Committee will not conduct a markup hearing prior to the upcoming Christmas break. Instead, the committee intends to monitor the bill’s progress for potential action in early 2026. Intensified Talks On Crypto Regulation In a statement released earlier this week, Jeff Naft, spokesperson for Chair Scott, emphasized the committee’s commitment to pursuing a bipartisan approach to address the complexities of digital asset market legislation. “Chairman Scott and the Senate Banking Committee have made strong progress,” Naft noted, underscoring continued efforts to establish a new regulatory framework that would enhance clarity for the crypto sector and position the United States as a leader in the digital assets arena. Negotiations have intensified over the past week, with Republican members of the Banking Committee working closely with their Democratic counterparts to seek a viable compromise.

Specific ethics concerns have arisen related to President Donald Trump and his family’s involvement in crypto-related business ventures, which reportedly have added to their wealth. As Congress prepares to reconvene after the holiday break, immediate attention will shift to federal government funding, with the current funding bill set to expire on January 30.

    "title": "Bitwise’s 2026 Crypto Forecast: Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Poised For New Record Highs",
    "body": "In its latest report, asset manager and exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer, Bitwise, has shared an optimistic 2026 outlook for the crypto market, anticipating significant growth, while predicting new all-time highs for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Megatrends In Crypto? Bitwise begins by asserting that Bitcoin is poised to break free from its traditional four-year price cycle, setting the stage for new records. Several factors contribute to this bullish forecast. The dynamics of past cycles, including the Bitcoin Halving, interest rate fluctuations, and market booms and busts fueled by leverage, are expected to be less impactful in the coming years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom Forecast: Top Expert Predicts $40,000 Target Next Year, Here’s The Analysis Notably, the entry of large institutions like Citi, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and Merrill Lynch into the crypto space is anticipated to accelerate institutional allocations toward spot ETFs and enhance on-chain developments by 2026. As a result, Bitcoin is projected to become less volatile, even indicating that it has demonstrated lower volatility than tech giant Nvidia throughout 2025. The report also expresses strong optimism for Ethereum and Solana, particularly contingent upon the passing of the CLARITY Act. Bitwise believes that the growth of stablecoins and tokenization represents significant “megatrends,” with both Ethereum and Solana positioned to be the primary beneficiaries of this trend. ETFs To Acquire New Market Supply Institutional demand is forecasted to surge, with ETFs expected to acquire more than 100% of the new supply of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. By 2026, Bitwise expects that most institutional investors will have access to crypto ETFs. As Bitwise projects the new supply hitting the market, estimates indicate roughly 166,000 Bitcoin valued at $15.3 billion, 960,000 Ethereum around $3.0 billion, and 23 million Solana coins amounting to $3.2 billion. However, the firm anticipates that ETFs will likely purchase even more than these figures suggest. The report further highlights that crypto equities are expected to outperform traditional tech stocks. While tech shares have surged by 140% over the past three years, crypto equities have significantly outpaced them. The Bitwise Crypto Innovators 30 Index, which tracks companies providing crucial infrastructure and services for crypto assets, has rocketed by 585% during the same time frame. Bitwise believes this momentum will persist into 2026, driven by potential revenue growth, mergers and acquisitions, and a favorable regulatory landscape. Stablecoins As Scapegoats For Economic Woes As stablecoins gain traction, Bitwise cautions that they may become scapegoats for destabilizing emerging market currencies. Currently valued at nearly $300 billion, the market for stablecoins, which include tokenized versions of the US dollar like USDT and USDC, is predicted to reach $500 billion by the end of 2026. With this rise, it’s anticipated that one or two countries may blame stablecoins for their financial troubles, despite the reality that people would not turn to stablecoins if their local currencies were stable. Related Reading: Cantor Fitzgerald Projects Major Growth For Hyperliquid (HYPE) In Explosive New Report Additionally, Bitwise forecasts the launch of over 100 crypto-linked ETFs in the United States, following the SEC’s issuance of new listing standards that enable these funds to enter the market under a unified regulatory framework. This regulatory clarity sets the stage for what Bitwise dubs “ETF-palooza” in 2026. Lastly, the firm predicts that half of Ivy League endowments will likely invest in cryptocurrencies, and that on-chain vault assets under management will double in the coming years. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $86,165, having recorded major losses of 2% and almost 7% over the past 24 hours and seven days respectively. Currently, the leading crypto is trading 31.8% below its all-time high of $126,000. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Risks Double-Top Crash Toward $0.40, Peter Brandt Warns",
    "body": "Veteran chartist Peter Brandt is flagging what he calls a “potential double top” on XRP’s weekly chart, a classic reversal setup that, if confirmed, would argue for materially lower prices — even as other traders point to a washed-out weekly RSI reading that has historically aligned with prior bottom zones. Peter Brandt Flags XRP Double Top Pattern Brandt posted the chart to X on Dec. 17 and didn’t bother softening the message for XRP’s online faithful. “I know in advance that all you Riplosts $XRP will forever remind me of this post — ask me if I care,” he wrote, before adding: “This is a potential double top. Sure, it may fail, and I will deal with this if it does. But for now this has bearish implications. Love it or not — you need to deal with it.” The chart shows XRP-USDT on Binance in weekly bars, with two highs clustered around $3.40 and $3.66 and a clearly marked support shelf near $2.00. In classical chart terms, that $2 region functions as the neckline: lose it with follow-through, and the market is no longer in “pullback inside a range” territory — it’s in “failed structure” territory. Related Reading: XRP Price Falls To Critical Support Level, Is It Time To Panic? That distinction matters because double tops tend to be less about the second peak itself and more about what happens at the midpoint low between the two peaks. Brandt’s framing reflects that: the pattern is “potential” until either support holds and price reclaims prior levels, or the neckline breaks and the market accepts lower. In this case, Brandt’s chart is already showing XRP trading below the $2.00 line, with the most recent marker around $1.8859. That puts the focus squarely on whether the breakdown becomes a sustained weekly close-and-hold below support, or whether the move gets reversed quickly enough to treat it as a bear trap. Or Is The XRP Bottom In? Not everyone reading the same tape is leaning into the bearish conclusion. Trader Cryptollica posted a separate XRP/USD weekly chart (Bitstamp) on Dec. 15 highlighting the weekly RSI at roughly 33, accompanied by the comment: “$XRP WEEKLY RSI : 33 💥”. The chart highlights that, in the past five cases, similarly low readings in XRP’s weekly RSI have tended to occur around market bottoming zones. Brandt was receptive to the conditional logic — specifically, the idea that a failed double top can flip from bearish to bullish if the breakdown doesn’t stick. Responding, he wrote: “Yea, if this dbl top fails then this could become exciting. I agree. I am not championing a bear case — just showing charts for what they are.” Related Reading: Best XRP Buy Zone? Analyst Breaks Down The Key Levels That exchange captures the actual tension here. Momentum measures like RSI can identify stretched conditions and recurring historical zones, but they do not, on their own, invalidate a price-structure breakdown. Notably, Brandt did not provide a price target in his comment. But the chart he shared contains enough structure to infer the standard “textbook” projection many technicians would use. With peaks near $3.60 and a neckline near $2.00, the pattern height is about $1.60. The conventional measured move subtracts that height from the neckline after a break, implying a target in the neighborhood of $0.40 if the setup fully plays out. That is not a forecast, and it’s not a promise the market will cooperate — it’s simply the arithmetic implied by the pattern Brandt is pointing at. The more immediate question is whether XRP can reclaim the $2.00 area decisively enough to turn the breakdown into a failed move. If it can’t, the chart conversation shifts from “potential double top” to “confirmed break,” and the downside math stops being hypothetical in traders’ positioning models. At press time, XRP traded at $1.83. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",
