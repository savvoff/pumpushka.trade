XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.120 zone. The price is now trading below $2.120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.10 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it stays below $2.120. XRP Price Attempts Recovery XRP price failed to stay above $2.20 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below $2.150 and $2.120 to enter a short-term bearish zone. The price even spiked below $2.050. A low was formed at $2.034, and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above $2.080, but the price stayed below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.415 swing high to the $2.034 low. The price is now trading below $2.120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.10 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.10 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $2.120 level. A close above $2.120 could send the price to $2.220 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.415 swing high to the $2.034 low. The next hurdle sits at $2.320. A clear move above the $2.320 resistance might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.3850 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.40. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.120 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.050 level. The next major support is near the $2.020 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.020 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.00. The next major support sits near the $1.9650 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.880.

    "title": "CZ Fuels Optimism As Binance Coin’s $1,000 Target Trends",
    "body": "Binance Coin climbed again over the weekend, pushing past the $900 mark and touching about $907 on Sunday after a sharp 24-hour uptick. Markets were calmer overall, with the broader crypto complex up 0.55% for the day while Bitcoin hovered above $92,000 and Ethereum traded beyond $3,100. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator Market Reaction To Regulatory Shift According to social posts from Changpeng Zhao, founder and former CEO of Binance who is also known as ‘CZ’, optimism around a possible new crypto cycle helped fuel demand. CZ linked the mood to a regulatory change, saying the Securities and Exchange Commission had removed crypto from its list of priority risks for 2026. Based on reports, that move is being read by some investors as a sign of easing scrutiny, and it appears to have lifted sentiment across tokens. I could be wrong, but Super Cycle incoming. https://t.co/6TLldEMmGA — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) January 10, 2026 Institutional Buying Adds Fuel Reports note sizable institutional flows into Bitcoin products. According to a filing, Wells Fargo bought 383 million of Bitcoin ETF shares, a figure that market watchers flagged as a large institutional stake. Morgan Stanley also filed for its own spot Bitcoin ETF last week, which many see as more proof that big financial players are stepping in. Those actions are being cited by traders as one reason risk assets like Binance Coin could see more interest. Macroeconomic Calendar Could Swing Prices A packed US data week is ahead and traders say it could affect crypto angles. On Monday, the market will watch a speech by the FOMC president. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the US Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index are due. Jobless claims come on Thursday, and a Fed balance sheet update lands on Friday. Any big surprise in those numbers can push liquidity flows and quickly change appetite for tokens. Binance Coin: Technical Levels To Watch BNB briefly reclaimed the $900 zone and was reported at $909 in some feeds as the four-hour chart showed a steady climb. Short-term resistance sits near $950, with a psychological barrier at $1,000. Related Reading: XRP Ledger May Get A Tokenized Gold Upgrade, Web3 Founder Reveals Technical indicators offered cautious support for bulls: the MACD showed a bullish crossover with the blue line above the signal line, and the histogram printed positive bars, which suggests buying pressure building. The RSI sat around 56.10, under overbought levels, implying room for more gains. Traders still point to a key support range near $850. A break below that could invite heavier selling and take prices down toward $820. The scenario of a quick pullback is real; prices that move fast up can move fast down. Market participants will be watching both the macro calendar and any fresh regulatory updates for clues. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "Crypto trading platform MEXC has rolled out a new promotional campaign built around its peer-to-peer marketplace, offering a $200,000 airdrop pool exclusively for users making their first-ever deposit on the platform. The limited-time event began on Jan. 4, 2026, at 11:00 UTC and will run until Jan. 31 at 16:59 UTC. Participation is restricted to accounts that have never previously deposited funds on MEXC, with eligibility tied specifically to deposits completed through the exchange’s P2P channel rather than standard trading methods. To take part, users must first register for the campaign via the dedicated event page. Only after opting in are participants able to qualify by completing their first P2P deposit and reaching a net deposited amount exceeding $100 during the event period. MEXC notes that users who fail to register before depositing will not be counted toward the promotion. Participants who meet the requirements within seven days of registration unlock a fixed 10 USDT reward. All rewards are distributed from a shared $200,000 pool and allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, meaning that late participants may miss out once the pool is fully claimed. Following the conclusion of the campaign, eligible rewards will be credited directly to users’ Spot wallets. MEXC states that distribution will take place within 14 calendar days after the event ends, with most users expected to receive their airdrops within five business days. The campaign places renewed focus on MEXC’s P2P trading service, which allows users to purchase cryptocurrencies using local currencies, flexible pricing, and a wide range of payment methods. Unlike traditional exchange trades, P2P transactions on MEXC come with zero platform fees, a feature the exchange continues to promote as competition among P2P marketplaces intensifies. Through the P2P platform, users can access major cryptocurrencies including USDT, Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, Dogecoin, and Solana. The service is designed to cater to regions where direct fiat on-ramps may be limited or where users prefer localized payment options. However, the exchange has outlined several restrictions tied to the promotion. Users who withdraw funds within 24 hours of meeting the deposit requirements will be disqualified from receiving rewards. In addition, participants who have previously received rewards from other MEXC P2P promotions are excluded from this campaign. Eligibility is limited to main accounts only. Sub-accounts cannot participate independently, and any activity associated with them will be consolidated under the primary account for the purposes of eligibility checks and reward calculations. MEXC also applies internal risk and compliance reviews before rewards are finalized. Any attempts to manipulate the event, including creating multiple accounts, providing false identity information, inflating trading data, or engaging in other forms of abnormal activity, may result in disqualification and forfeiture of rewards. The exchange added that the campaign rules may be adjusted or terminated if necessary. Users were also reminded that cryptocurrency markets remain volatile and that promotional incentives do not remove the risks associated with trading digital assets. Claim the P2P airdrop",

    "body": "Bitcoin pushed above the $92,000 level late-Sunday as a legal escalation around Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell became public. The catalyst was Powell’s decision to publicly address Department of Justice subpoenas and a criminal probe he characterized as political pressure tied to the administration’s rate preferences. In a video released Sunday evening, Powell directly addressed US President Donald Trump: “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Fed setting rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.” BREAKING: Fed Chair Powell responds after Federal prosecutors open a criminal investigation into him: “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Fed setting rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of… pic.twitter.com/y1dRdoQ1fm — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) January 12, 2026 Bitcoin Community Reacts To The News The Bitcoin and broader crypto market responded immediately with a decent push higher, while “metals [were] blasting to new highs,” as analyst Will Clemente wrote via X. Related Reading: CVDD Model Signals Bitcoin Is Not Yet Deeply Undervalued: Drawdown Lags Historical Cycles The timing matters for crypto traders: the Fed is heading into its January 28 meeting with the market increasingly primed for a pause in cuts, amplifying sensitivity to any perception that monetary policy is being pulled into partisan conflict. For Bitcoin-native observers, the episode read like a real-time stress test of institutional trust: one that flatters Bitcoin’s pitch. Clemente added via X: “This environment is literally what Bitcoin was created for. The President is coming after the Fed chair. Metals are ripping as sovereigns diversify reserves. Stocks & risk assets at record highs. Geopolitical risk rising.” Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy, put the contrast in monetary regimes front and center, arguing that Bitcoin’s “credibly neutral, predictable, transparent, and censorship resistant monetary policy looks pretty good here,” after flagging Powell’s view that the subpoenas are “pretexts” for administrative meddling in monetary policy. Related Reading: Cathie Wood: Trump May Buy Bitcoin For US Reserve Ahead Of Midterms Others used the moment to widen the indictment beyond any single personality. Bitwise advisor Jeff Park argued that “independence alone cannot be a virtue when the institution at its core is incompetent,” adding that “the age of Bitcoin is drawing nearer.” Walker, a prominent pro-Bitcoin voice, framed it as a structural problem: “The problem isn’t President Trump or Jerome Powell. The problem is a centralized cabal of unelected banker-bureaucrats set the price of money and print it out of thin air.” Notably, the bullish reflex wasn’t rooted in sympathy for Powell. Strive CEO Matt Cole wrote he had “zero sympathy” for the Fed chair and accused the central bank of “gaslight[ing] the American people” on independence, concluding: “Bitcoin is even more underpriced than we realized…” Bitcoin’s move through $92,000 puts that narrative onto a price chart, but the same political-legal feedback loop that fuels the “neutral money” thesis can also intensify volatility. “For the first time ever, Fed Chair Powell is fighting back: Over the last 12 months, Fed Chair Powell has remained silent amid President Trump’s criticisms,” The Kobeissi Letter wrote via X, adding: “Today, that changed. Trump vs Powell will result in even more volatility.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,560. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Win Your Share of US$250,000 in SOL, Enter the Airdrop Arena",
    "body": "Crypto.com has launched a fresh reward campaign inside Airdrop Arena, giving users a new way to earn without needing to trade daily. The event comes with a headline incentive, a US$250,000 SOL token reward pool that will be distributed to participants who allocate CRO during the campaign window. The promotion is already live and runs for the full month of January, combining Crypto.com’s CRO ecosystem with Solana, one of the most active layer-1 networks in crypto right now. Instead of pushing high-volume trading, this campaign is built around steady participation, where users accumulate points over time and receive SOL rewards after the event ends. A Straightforward CRO Allocation Reward System The structure behind the campaign is intentionally simple. Users allocate CRO into Airdrop Arena, earn points while the event is active, and then receive a portion of the SOL pool based on how many points they’ve collected. Crypto.com is also rewarding early activity. The first 10,000 users who allocate CRO unlock an exclusive points boost of up to 120%, giving them a clear advantage right from the start. On top of that, users can qualify for a daily points boost of up to 120% when they purchase at least 1,500 CRO and transfer it into Airdrop Arena. Tip: The purchase task needs to be completed before allocating CRO, otherwise the daily boost may not apply. How to Participate Through the Crypto.com App Everything happens inside the Crypto.com app, making the process quick even for casual users. Airdrop Arena can be accessed through the Account section, the Earn tab, or the Supermenu. Once inside the feature, users simply allocate CRO into the event and begin earning points automatically. There’s no need for constant monitoring, no complicated strategy, and no trading requirement, which makes this campaign feel more like passive participation than active speculation. Visit Crypto.com Allocate now and start building points. Campaign Dates and Key Event Details The event runs on a fixed schedule: Event duration: 1 January 2026, 10:00 UTC to 31 January 2026, 09:59 UTC Once the event ends, Crypto.com will calculate each participant’s points total and distribute SOL accordingly. Rewards, Distribution Timeline, and Lockup Rules SOL rewards will be airdropped within 7 days after the campaign concludes. Users who activate Loot Locker will receive their rewards after the lockup period ends. If Loot Locker is not enabled, SOL will be distributed directly to the user’s Crypto Wallet. The CRO allocation itself comes with a long-term condition: allocated CRO is locked for 6 months. After the lockup ends, users can withdraw their CRO or keep it allocated in Airdrop Arena to automatically join future campaigns, which is clearly designed to encourage longer-term engagement instead of short-term participation. Solana Rewards Add Extra Appeal Choosing SOL as the reward asset is not random. Solana remains one of the most watched ecosystems in crypto, supported by ongoing developer activity, memecoin momentum, DeFi growth, and infrastructure expansion. That makes SOL a reward that users actually want to hold, not just a token they instantly dump. By linking CRO allocation with SOL incentives, Crypto.com effectively ties its platform activity to another major chain that continues to attract attention from both retail and serious market participants. Airdrop Arena Reflects a Bigger Exchange Trend This campaign also fits a bigger shift happening across exchanges. Platforms are increasingly moving away from pure volume-driven rewards and instead focusing on loyalty mechanics: time-based campaigns, allocation systems, and engagement incentives that keep users active inside the ecosystem. For CRO holders, the SOL Airdrop Arena offers a way to gain exposure to Solana without selling assets or actively trading. For Crypto.com, it strengthens retention and pushes long-term platform participation through structured lockups and recurring event access. Visit Airdop Arena Allocate now and watch your points grow.",

    "title": "Solana Price Jumps, But Network Adoption Remains Weak",
    "body": "On-chain data shows the Network Growth indicator has continued to fall for Solana recently, a sign that adoption of the asset has remained weak. Solana Network Growth Has Been Declining According to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, SOL’s recent price recovery has come despite a drop in the Network Growth. This metric measures the weekly total number of addresses that are coming online on the blockchain for the first time. A wallet comes “online” on the network when it participates in some kind of transfer activity. Thus, the wallets that the Network Growth is counting are the ones that are making their first transaction on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Drop To $69,000 If Pennant Support Breaks, Analyst Warns When the value of the Network Growth is high, it means that a large number of addresses are being created on the blockchain. Such a trend can be a sign that an influx of users is occurring. On the other hand, the indicator being low suggests that there isn’t much new address generation taking place on the network, which can be a potential indication that the chain isn’t attracting fresh investors. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Solana Network Growth over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Solana Network Growth has witnessed a drawdown recently, despite the fact that the SOL price has made some recovery since its December low. This suggests that the bullish price action has been unable to bring fresh attention to the cryptocurrency. Historically, rallies have generally needed the incoming of new investors to be sustainable, as it’s the increased trading activity that provides them with the fuel to go on. In the chart, Santiment has highlighted the case of a rally where this requirement wasn’t met. The Network Growth was initially at a significant level, but as this price surge from 2025 played out, the metric’s value plummeted. This could be a potential factor behind the rally eventually running out of momentum. In late 2024, the opposite conditions were present, as the Network Growth shot up alongside the Solana bull run, implying adoption backed the price appreciation. Considering these past cases, it’s possible that the indicator might have to reverse its trajectory if SOL’s recovery has to last. The latest downward move in the Network Growth is also not the only development SOL is dealing with right now. From the graph, it’s visible that the indicator has gone through a long-term downtrend since its high in November 2024.

It now remains to be seen whether the long decline in the adoption of Solana will continue or if a turnaround will appear. SOL Price Solana recovered back to $144 on Sunday, but the coin has retraced to open the week as its price is back at $139. Featured image from Dall-E, Santiment.net, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Why XRP Deserves A Place As Long-Term Wealth And Life-Saving Strategy",
    "body": "In a world where financial systems are becoming fragile, XRP stands out as the intersection of a financial infrastructure designed for instant global value transfer, speed, reliability, and global accessibility. XRP’s ability to move value instantly across borders, with minimal cost and without reliance on fragile banking systems, positions it as both a long-term wealth tool and a potential life-saving instrument. XRP should be considered as part of life-saving plans. An analyst known as Bird on X has pointed out that most people keep their money in the bank, earning around 4-6% a year, and feel comfortable with it, but they rarely factor in the impact of inflation. Over time, the purchasing power of currencies like the US dollar and the British pound has been quietly eroded to the point where your money can grow on paper while losing value in the real world. XRP’s Role In The Next Phase Of Global Payments Although savings accounts are safe, many people are actually standing still or falling massively behind without even realizing it, which is why XRP comes in as a long-term life-saving strategy. XRP has spent years held back by legal uncertainty, and during that time, the technology continued to mature. Currently, there’s clarity, and what was being built has become visible. Related Reading: XRP Ledger May Get A Tokenized Gold Upgrade, Web3 Founder Reveals Real-world usage is arriving in cross-border payments, institutions are engaging, stablecoins like RLUSD are being introduced, and real-world assets are being tokenized on the chain. As the utility is increasing, capital is flowing into the ecosystem. More usage creates more demand, and sustained demand is what drives long-term value growth. According to Bird, XRP is to be trusted more than fiat, which is why it is a long-term savings vehicle rather than a short-term trade. XRP can be reserved for self-custody, stored on a cold wallet, removing reliance on banks altogether. Instead of earning a few percentages while fighting inflation, you’re holding a digital asset positioned at the centre of growing global financial infrastructure, which is more likely to increase in value over time. In comparison, it is unclear whether inflation will ever pause to make cash worth more. The analyst views this scenario as a long-term wealth investment and believes that XRP will become one of the most utilised digital assets in the world. Thus, building a savings position now could prove to be one of the smartest financial decisions someone could make over the long run. A Bridge Between Old Money And New Rails ChartNerd noted that Ripple is not built to be a traditional crypto company that aims to destroy the old money. Instead, Ripple acts as the bridge between the old and new financial worlds, and this will be a more successful long-term strategy.

    "title": "Dogecoin Breaks Its ‘Lower-Band Prison’ As Daily Trend Flips",
    "body": "The Dogecoin price is currently up by approximately 17% since the December 31 low and the rebound is starting to look less like a dead-cat bounce and more like a regime change, according to crypto analyst Cantonese Cat, who points to a clear shift in how DOGE is trading inside its Bollinger Bands on the daily chart. The setup matters now because price has moved from months of lower-band pressure into the upper half of the range, often the earliest tell that trend behavior is rotating. Cantonese Cat’s latest daily view (Binance) frames the move through Bollinger Band positioning rather than pattern-chasing. As the analyst put it: “DOGE daily shows a clear trend change that is easy to see when you see how it was riding on the lower half of the Bollinger band for months but now has a clear change in character.” That “character” is visible in the band mechanics. DOGE closed around $0.1405 on the print shown, now trading above the 20-day basis line near $0.1348 after spending much of the prior stretch leaning into the lower half of the envelope. The upper band is near $0.1564 and the lower band near $0.1132. Related Reading: Here’s How High The Dogecoin Price Would If It Repeats Previous Parabolic Runs In the analyst’s framing, the basis line becomes the near-term “line in the sand” for whether this is a genuine trend flip or simply a volatility expansion that fades. Holding above it keeps price in the upper half of the bands, where trends typically behave differently than they do during lower-band rides. Weekly And Monthly Chart Support The Thesis Zooming out, Cantonese Cat’s weekly chart (Dec. 20) casts the broader structure as an Elliott-style sequence: a completed Wave 1 advance followed by a Wave 2 correction. The analyst wrote: “We’ve already had a 13 month bear market for DOGE, with my working hypothesis of this being likely a wave 2 correction prior to wave 3 explosion. The entire reason why this may play out is that it doesn’t feel likely right now, and you want me to stop posting.” Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Rally A Dead Cat Bounce? Analysts Weigh In The levels on the chart are explicit. DOGE is sitting between the 0.382 retracement near $0.1177 and the 0.5 level near $0.1542, with higher retracement markers at roughly $0.2021 (0.618), $0.2477 (0.707), $0.2968 (0.786), and $0.3732 (0.886). Above that, the 1.0 level is labeled near $0.4844, with extensions reaching approximately $0.9029 (1.272), $1.2497 (1.414), $1.9934 (1.618), $4.7793 (2.0), and $8.9077 (2.272), the latter aligning with the analyst’s repeatedly cited “$9 region” target for this cycle. On Jan. 9, Cantonese Cat paired DOGE’s monthly chart with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), arguing a recurring bull-phase rhythm: “DOGE has always been about 2-4 months behind IWM during the bull phase.” The comparison highlights prior instances where IWM’s breakout behavior preceded DOGE’s major upside phases, implying DOGE’s current improvement could be read as a delayed echo if the template holds. Overall, the near-term question is whether DOGE can keep closing above the daily Bollinger basis (~$0.1348) and avoid slipping back into the lower-half posture that defined the prior months. On the upside, a break above the upper band region (~$0.1564) and the 0.5 Fib ($0.1542) is crucial for further upside. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.13674.

    "title": "This Ethereum Triangle Breakout Puts Price Above $24,000, Here’s The Path",
    "body": "Ethereum is nearing a decisive phase that could unlock a major long-term price expansion. A higher-timeframe analysis shared by a TradingView analyst suggests that, despite current short-term weakness, Ethereum remains structurally positioned for a significant upside move. If the ongoing formation resolves as expected, the projected breakout places Ethereum’s price well above $24,000. Ethereum’s Long-Term Structure Remains Intact From a broader perspective, the analyst emphasizes that Ethereum has not broken its established trend since 2020. Over that period, price action has continued to form higher highs, reinforcing the view that the long-term structure remains valid. Rather than signaling failure, the prolonged consolidation seen over recent years is framed as stabilization within a large and defined range. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Strongest XRP Price Rally In History Is Coming, Here’s Why This range sits between $1,000 and $3,000, with the $1,000 level identified as a critical psychological and structural support. According to the analysis, Ethereum’s ability to hold above this zone is central to the bullish thesis. Remaining above it allows the asset to continue developing a massive ascending triangle, a formation often associated with strong continuation moves once completed. Within this triangle, the analyst outlines a clear progression of internal price phases. Two major legs of the structure have already formed, and Ethereum is now moving through the final phase needed to complete the setup. This phase has brought short-term bearish signals, but they remain part of the broader structure rather than a structural breakdown. As the price approaches the lower boundary of the triangle, several layers of support converge. These include the rising structural trendline and key moving averages that have historically supported Ethereum’s price. The analyst notes that stabilization and a bounce are likely in this area, provided Ethereum does not break below the triangle’s lower limit. Such a break would invalidate the structure, but current conditions suggest that risk remains contained. Why A Breakout Opens The Door To $24,000 The bullish scenario hinges on confirmation. Once the triangle is fully formed and Ethereum breaks above its upper boundary, the analyst expects a continuation move to follow. Based on the size of the formation and prior market behavior, the projected expansion points to a move of roughly 300% from current levels. When applied to Ethereum’s existing range, that expansion places the primary bullish target above $24,000. This projection is not presented as a short-term price call, but as the potential outcome of a multi-year structure finally resolving upward. Related Reading: XRP Mirrors Gold’s Trajectory: What A Similar ATH Rally Would Mean Additional context strengthens this outlook. Ethereum continues to benefit from growing institutional participation, and recent data shows record stablecoin transfer volumes exceeding $8 trillion on the network. These developments suggest increasing reliance on Ethereum’s infrastructure, which could support sustained price expansion following a confirmed breakout. Ultimately, the analyst believes Ethereum’s next major move depends on how this consolidation phase concludes. If the structure holds and the breakout is confirmed, the path toward prices above $24,000 becomes a technical continuation rather than an outlier scenario.

    "title": "Analyst Highlights Fibonacci Level That Could Put Dogecoin Price Top Above $10",
    "body": "Crypto analyst DOGECAPITAL has drawn attention to a Fibonacci level that indicates that the Dogecoin price top is above $10. The analyst also highlighted the meme coin’s performance during past bull cycles to explain why it could rally to double digits. Dogecoin Price Eyes Rally Above $10 Based on These Fibonacci Extensions In an X post, DOGECAPITAL predicted that the Dogecoin price could rally above $10, which would mark the top for the foremost meme coin. This came as he noted that the monthly DOGE chart highlights where major cycle peaks have historically formed using Fibonacci extensions and that this pattern is “remarkably consistent.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Rapid Accumulation Suggests Sharp Upward Sweep Is Coming The crypto analyst mentioned that in the first cycle, the Dogecoin price topped exactly at the 4.236 Fibonacci level. In the second cycle, DOGE is said to have peaked again at the 4.236 Fibonacci level. DOGECAPITAL remarked that this pattern isn’t random but rather a structural behavior. He then stated that if this pattern continues into the next cycle, the data strongly suggests that the Dogecoin price’s upcoming cycle top could again align with the 4.236 Fibonacci level, which currently sits at $33.25. DOGECAPITAL added history doesn’t repeat perfectly, but it often rhymes. In this case, DOGE has followed its long-term Fibonacci structure with “near-perfect accuracy,” which is why he is confident that the meme coin could reach this price target. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that DOGECAPITAL’s accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could reach this $33.25 target between now and 2028. Interestingly, the chart showed that DOGE could rally to as high as $100 if it reaches the upper boundary of the ascending channel. A rally to these targets would mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for the meme coin, whose current ATH is $0.74. Market Cap Doesn’t Matter For DOGE A potential Dogecoin price rally to $33.25 would give the meme coin a market cap of around $5.6 trillion. However, DOGECAPITAL stated that market cap has never dictated how DOGE moves. He said that if it did, half the insane runs in crypto wouldn’t exist. The analyst noted that Shiba Inu exploded to a massive valuation in 2021 with no “realistic” justification, yet the market still sent it to such highs. Related Reading: Analyst Says the Worst Is Over For Dogecoin, Predicts Rally To $0.8 DOGECAPITAL stated that his focus is on the long-term Fibonacci structure and that the Dogecoin price has topped at the 4.236 Fib level in two separate cycles. He added that this is the entire point of the chart and that it is not tied to any quarter, fundamentals, or market cap logic. The analyst also claimed that short-term volatility doesn’t erase a decade-long pattern and that if the Fib structure breaks, he will adjust accordingly. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.14, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "New Hope For Crypto: Senators Introduce Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act",
    "body": "In a major new development for the crypto industry, Senators Ron Wyden and Cynthia Lummis announced on Monday evening the introduction of a bipartisan, standalone version of the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA). This legislation aims to provide much-needed clarity for software developers and infrastructure providers in the blockchain space, particularly concerning their classification under federal law. New Crypto Bill To Protect Blockchain Developers According to the detailed press release regarding the matter, the BRCA specifies that developers and providers who do not have control over user funds will not be classified as money transmitters. Senator Lummis highlighted the ongoing challenges faced by blockchain developers, stating: Blockchain developers who have simply written code and maintain open-source infrastructure have lived under threat of being classified as money transmitters for far too long. This designation makes no sense when they never touch, control, or have access to user funds, and unnecessarily limits innovation. Related Reading: Crucial Role Of The CLARITY Act In Avoiding A New October 10 Crypto Crash, Expert Explains Lummis emphasized that the bill provides developers with the clarity needed to advance digital finance without the fear of legal repercussions for activities that do not pose a money laundering risk. Lummis added, “It’s time to stop treating software developers like banks simply because they write code.” Senator Wyden echoed these concerns, arguing that imposing the same regulatory requirements on developers as those applied to exchanges or brokers is fundamentally flawed. Main Highlights Of The BRCA The Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act aims to set clear federal standards defining when blockchain developers and service providers can be exempt from money transmitter regulations. Under current legislation toward crypto, the Senators assert blockchain developers face regulatory ambiguities that have not only stifled innovation but also driven many projects offshore, as they navigate conflicting regulations across different states. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Its ‘Lower-Band Prison’ As Daily Trend Flips The bill specifically establishes that a “non-controlling developer or provider” refers to any entity that develops or maintains distributed ledger technology but does not possess the unilateral authority to initiate or execute transactions involving users’ digital assets without third-party consent. In addition, the crypto bill clarifies protected activities, including the development or publication of software for distributed ledgers, maintenance services for blockchain networks, offering customer self-custody solutions, and providing necessary infrastructure to support distributed ledger services. Importantly, while the bill allows states to enforce their laws consistent with federal regulations, it also prevents them from imposing money transmitter requirements on developers engaged solely in the specified protected activities.

    "title": "Trump-Powell Conflict Fuels Volatility While Retail Sells Bitcoin At A Loss – Details",
    "body": "Bitcoin has entered a fresh bout of volatility after a rare and highly charged response from Jerome Powell, following reports that federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation related to his conduct as Federal Reserve Chair. In a direct and unusually pointed statement, Powell said: “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Fed setting rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.” Related Reading: CVDD Model Signals Bitcoin Is Not Yet Deeply Undervalued: Drawdown Lags Historical Cycles The market reaction was immediate. Bitcoin dropped from the $92,500 area to nearly $90,500, reflecting heightened uncertainty as traders reassessed political and macro risks. The move interrupted an otherwise stable consolidation phase and reintroduced volatility at a moment when BTC was attempting to build support above the $90,000 level. What makes this episode particularly notable is the shift in Powell’s public stance. Over the past 12 months, despite repeated criticism from President Trump, Powell consistently declined to engage, often responding with variations of “I have no response or comment.” That long-standing silence broke yesterday. As markets digest the implications, Bitcoin now finds itself at the intersection of macro policy, political pressure, and investor psychology. The next reaction—both from policymakers and from risk assets—could prove decisive for short-term price direction. Retail Fear Persists as Short-Term Holders Capitulate Within the Uptrend A recent CryptoQuant analysis adds another layer to the current political and macro-driven volatility, revealing that retail investors remain fearful of short-term price swings even as Bitcoin maintains a broader upward structure. The Short-Term Holder SOPR (STH SOPR) highlights a recurring behavioral pattern that tends to appear during corrective phases within a larger bull trend. Despite Bitcoin printing higher highs and higher lows throughout 2024 and 2025, short-term investors have been consistently realizing losses. Toward the end of last year, retail sentiment deteriorated sharply, with the STH SOPR dropping to around 0.98. Levels last seen in November 2022, when Bitcoin was trading near $16,000. While the indicator has not fully entered extreme capitulation territory below 0.98, it has remained under the neutral 1.00 level for more than 70 days, signaling sustained selling at a loss. This divergence is critical when STH SOPR remains below 1.00, coinciding with extended consolidations or corrective phases, driven by heightened pressure since Bitcoin broke above its previous all-time high. Historically, periods where STH SOPR stays below 1.00 coincide with extended consolidation or corrective phases, driven by elevated fear and realized losses. However, during the current uptrend, these episodes have repeatedly marked favorable accumulation zones. The mismatch between rising prices and capitulating retail behavior often reflects opportunity rather than weakness. This highlights Bitcoin’s underlying structural strength despite short-term volatility. Related Reading: Ethereum Long-Term Cost Basis Holds Firm: Structural Floor Forms Near $2.8K Bitcoin Consolidates Below Key Resistance as Volatility Compresses Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows the market in a consolidation phase following a sharp correction from the October highs near $120,000. After losing the $100,000 psychological level, BTC found demand in the low-$80,000s before rebounding toward the $90,000–$94,000 range, where price is currently stalling. This zone has clearly become a short-term equilibrium. With buyers defending higher lows but struggling to generate enough momentum for a decisive breakout. From a trend perspective, Bitcoin remains below the 50-week moving average, which is now acting as dynamic resistance around the mid-$90,000 area. In contrast, the 100-week moving average continues to slope upward well below the price. Reinforcing the idea that the broader macro trend remains intact despite recent weakness. The 200-week moving average, far lower, continues to define the long-term bull market structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Remains In A High-Risk Zone As Short-Term Holders Stay Underwater Volume has compressed significantly during this consolidation, suggesting reduced participation and indecision. This typically precedes a volatility expansion rather than a continuation of slow, sideways trading. As long as BTC holds above the rising 100-week moving average, downside appears structurally limited. Failure to reclaim the $94,000 resistance zone would keep the market vulnerable to another leg of consolidation before a sustainable trend resumes.

    "title": "Get Ready For An XRP Price Explosion Once This Happens; Analyst",
    "body": "Analysts are calling for an XRP price explosion, as the cryptocurrency’s market structure and the reappearance of historically reliable technical patterns support this bullish outlook. Although XRP experienced a brief rebound at the beginning of 2026, its price has since given back some of those gains and is now trading slightly above $2.0. Nevertheless, analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s near-term growth and have identified a key setup that could trigger the anticipated surge. XRP Price Prepares For Major Explosion Market expert CRYPTOWZRD has shared a fresh technical analysis of XRP, pointing to a familiar setup that previously led to an explosive price surge. He stated that XRP has spent more than a year trading sideways, forming a base that closely resembles an early pre-rally phase. Related Reading: Wall Street Analyst Is Still Bullish On Bitcoin, Predicts Price Recovery This sideways behavior had preceded a sharp vertical breakout during the 2024 bull cycle. CRYPTOWZRD noted that the current market structure mirrors this setup, suggesting that history may repeat itself if conditions align. His chart supports this view by showing XRP locked in a broad horizontal range for an extended period. In the past, XRP’s price repeatedly bounced between a clearly defined yellow support zone and red resistance bands, confirming range-bound behavior and accumulation. On the chart, the historical breakout is visible as a strong, impulsive upward move that followed XRP’s retest of support and the invalidation of the previous downtrend. Following its initial price rally in July 2024, XRP entered a topping phase near the upper red resistance area. After failing to hold those highs, the cryptocurrency saw a sharp pullback described as a “quick dump,” which drove prices back toward a key support region in the next month. Interestingly, XRP began to trade within a descending channel after the pullback. Once the price broke the channel’s upper boundary, it triggered a powerful rally, propelling XRP from approximately $0.5 to over $2. A similar descending channel is now visible in XRP’s current market structure, reinforcing the analyst’s view that another parabolic move may be unfolding. In this setup, XRP has already broken above the upper boundary of the channel, and now its price is expected to push through the red resistance bands positioned between $3.4 and $3.7 Analyst Warns That XRP Must Clear $2.26 Or Risk Another Drop Speaking on current price action, crypto analyst ChartNerd warns that XRP could see another price correction if it fails to break and hold above the $2.26 support level. According to the expert, both the weekly 20 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the middle regression band of the Gaussian Channel are acting as resistance. Related Reading: Here’s Why the Bitcoin Price Was Able To Break $94,000 The chart also shows these indicators converging at the $2.26 support level, strengthening the barrier XRP must overcome. A failure to break above this level could cause the price to retrace back toward multi-month support near $1.9, where a higher low could form if buyers step in.

    "title": "Crypto Products Post $454M Weekly Outflows On Fed Jitters",
    "body": "Markets pulled $454 million from crypto exchange-traded products last week as investors stepped back amid rising bets that the US Federal Reserve may not cut rates soon. Related Reading: CZ Fuels Optimism As Binance Coin’s $1,000 Target Trends According to CoinShares data and market reports, the move erased much of the early-week gains that had pushed roughly $1.5 billion into the sector during the first two trading days. The shift was sharp and broad, though a few assets saw money flow in. Smart Money Flees Bitcoin While Some Altcoins Attract Cash Bitcoin-linked products bore the brunt of withdrawals, with about $405 million leaving Bitcoin ETPs. Ethereum funds were also hit, posting roughly $116 million in outflows. Multi-asset crypto products reported net redemptions near $21 million. Based on reports, these outflows came as recent inflation and jobs data made investors lower the odds of a March Fed rate cut, weakening appetite for risk assets that had been boosted by earlier optimism. Selective Inflows Show Pockets Of Interest But not all tokens were abandoned. XRP funds drew around $46 million in fresh money, while Solana products attracted about $33 million. Smaller tokens, including some newer layer-one projects, picked up modest flows as investors hunted for opportunities beyond the main leaders. Total assets under management across global crypto ETPs remained near $182 billion, a figure that shows scale despite the weekly redemptions. Regional Patterns Reveal US Outflows And Overseas Inflows According to regional flow data, US-linked crypto investment products saw roughly $569 million exit last week. That outflow contrasted with inflows in some European and North American markets: Germany attracted about $59 million, Canada added $25 million, and Switzerland drew roughly $21 million. The pattern suggests capital moved away from US vehicles and into other jurisdictions where investor appetite held up better. What Traders And Analysts Are Saying Based on reports from market analysts, the reversal came as traders reassessed the timing of monetary easing. With inflation readings remaining firmer than expected and the labor market showing resilience, market pricing shifted and risk assets were repriced. Some analysts warned that volatility could persist while others noted that pockets of demand for specific altcoins might support short-term rallies. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator According to observers, the outflows highlight how sensitive crypto fund flows are to macroeconomic signals. While $454 million is a meaningful weekly move, the sector’s overall AUM near $182 billion means a single week does not rewrite the market picture. Investors will likely watch upcoming economic releases and Fed communications closely; fund flows are expected to respond quickly to any sign that rate-cut hopes are returning or fading further.
