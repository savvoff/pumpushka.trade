    "title": "TechCrunch Founder Names XRP Among His Largest Crypto Positions",
    "body": "Michael Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch and CrunchBase, has placed XRP among his largest personal crypto holdings, according to a recent social post. Related Reading: Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund He listed XRP as one of his top five positions by dollar value, alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and Immutable. The disclosure landed plenty of attention online and reignited debate about who is buying what and why. Arrington’s Holdings And Community Reaction Reports have disclosed that his post drew heavy engagement, with replies running the gamut from Bitcoin-only stances to more mixed portfolios. Several industry figures echoed Arrington’s mix; Tony Edward, for example, listed XRP with BTC and ETH when discussing core positions. The debate was loud and fast on social feeds. Some users framed the move as a vote of confidence. Others warned that one investor’s choices do not equal a market-wide shift. Tell me your top five crypto holdings (by total dollar value). Mine are XRP, BTC, ETH and IMX — Michael Arrington 🏴‍☠️ (@arrington) December 13, 2025 Institutional Moves Follow Based on reports, Arrington’s public support is tied to direct institutional activity. In October, Arrington Capital joined Ripple and SBI Holdings to back an initiative by Evernorth aimed at building a large institutional XRP treasury. The project, which has been described in some circles as among the biggest of its kind, aims to increase institutional use of XRP and to support on-ledger activity such as decentralized finance and lending. That involvement means Arrington is more than a vocal supporter; he is also tied to projects that could change how institutions use the token. XRP Market Moves And Key Figures XRP’s market picture has been mixed. As of December 16, 2025, the token was trading around $1.98, having held in a roughly $2.00 to $2.20 band in recent sessions. There was a small daily lift of about 1.2% to roughly $2.08 on Monday, which helped the token cover some ground after early-December weakness. The year has seen bigger swings: XRP peaked near $3.65 in July before giving back some gains. Activity in regulated derivatives has also grown. Reports point to XRP futures on the CME reaching a record open interest of roughly $3 billion in late October 2025, a figure that market watchers say reflects rising institutional appetite for regulated exposure. Related Reading: Analyst: Bitcoin’s Cycle Is Intact, Yet No Longer Purely Market-Driven A Past Claim That No Longer Holds Arrington has previously highlighted XRP’s strong performance. In March, he tweeted that XRP had been the best-performing major asset across multiple time frames — 90 days, 180 days, one year and three years. That claim no longer lines up with current rankings. Performance metrics have shifted since then, and the statement has been overtaken by later results. Featured image from Bitpanda Blog, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Cantor Fitzgerald Projects Major Growth For Hyperliquid (HYPE) In Explosive New Report",
    "body": "Cantor Fitzgerald, one of the world’s leading asset management firms, has released an in-depth report highlighting the promising future of the decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid (HYPE). The 62-page analysis predicts significant growth for both the platform and its native token over the next decade, painting a bullish outlook for investors. Hyperliquid As ‘The Exchange Of All Exchanges’ As detailed in the report, Hyperliquid operates as a decentralized exchange specializing in trading perpetual futures and is built on a custom layer-1 blockchain. Currently, HYPE has a fully diluted market cap of approximately $15.8 billion. Year-to-date (YTD) 2025, the platform has generated an impressive $874 million in fees from a staggering $2.947 trillion in trading volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom Forecast: Top Expert Predicts $40,000 Target Next Year, Here’s The Analysis A key feature that makes HYPE particularly attractive, and highlighted in the report, is its unique fee structure: approximately 99% of all fees generated by the protocol are allocated to repurchasing and burning the underlying token. This mechanism not only supports the value of HYPE but also reduces its circulating supply. In early 2025 alone, about 2.6% of all HYPE tokens expected to be in circulation, or roughly 5% of the current supply, were repurchased and burned. With the anticipation of new product launches, Cantor Fitzgerald views HYPE as “the exchange of all exchanges” and believes there’s a realistic path for annual fees to soar to $5 billion within the next decade. Why Market Dynamics Favor HYPE When it comes to the platform’s native token, HYPE has successfully captured considerable market share and emerged as one of the standout products in the cryptocurrency space over the past year. In addition to perpetual trading, Hyperliquid has launched spot trading and HIP-3 markets, enabling users to create new markets for a variety of assets including stocks and commodities. Cantor Fitzgerald’s report emphasizes that the immediate determinant of HYPE’s market price will hinge on industry sentiment regarding competition. The ability of emerging rivals to challenge HYPE and affect its fee-generating capacity is paramount. However, the report argues that current fears surrounding competition may be overstated. It posits that “point tourists”—those who shift from platform to platform seeking incentives—are likely to return to the platform offering the deepest liquidity and best execution, which, according to Cantor Fitzgerald, is Hyperliquid. A mere 1% increase in market share from CEX competitors in the perpetuals sector could translate to approximately $600 billion in trading volume. Based on existing perpetual fee rates, this could result in an additional $272 million in annual fees. By applying a conservative 25x valuation multiple to these fees, the potential market capitalization would rise to $6.8 billion. HYPE Price To Reach $271? Assuming moderate share gains over the next decade—projecting around 17% in perpetual trades and 18% in spot trading—Hyperliquid’s annual fees could surpass the $5 billion mark. A conservative valuation multiple of 25x, this would suggest a future market capitalization of approximately $125 billion. Given that nearly all generated fees will be used to repurchase HYPE tokens, a large portion of the circulating supply could potentially be bought back by the time the platform reaches these fee levels. With a forecasted expansion of the fully diluted market cap from roughly $15.8 billion today to $125 billion in the future, combined with a declining supply of HYPE tokens, the projected share price is poised to increase at an even faster pace. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecast: Key Factors That Could Propel It To $3 In Early 2026 If 20% of the Hyperliquid token float is repurchased—valued at around $3.5 billion today—the report suggests that the HYPE price could reach $271 at a fully diluted valuation of $125 billion. The projections suggest that if HYPE captures just 1% of the market share annually and maintains consistent trading volumes from CEXs, the price of HYPE could grow substantially. By year 10, the asset manager believes that circulating supply could decrease from 577.2 million to approximately 144.9 million, while the market cap could remain around $16.1 billion based on conservative fee estimates excluding spot and HIP-3 revenues. At the time of writing, Hyperliquid’s native token is trading at $26.49, having recorded major losses of almost 32% over the past month. This represents a 55% gap from the current trading levels and the all-time high of $59.30. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Why Ethereum Is Chosen As A Settlement Layer For New Money Market Fund",
    "body": "In a significant milestone for the evolution of on-chain finance, a new money market fund has selected Ethereum as its primary settlement layer toward blockchain-native infrastructure for traditional financial products. This decision reflects growing confidence in ETH security, scalability, ecosystem maturity, and qualities that institutional investors and asset managers increasingly demand when moving regulated financial instruments onto public blockchains. How The New On-Chain Settlement Improves Operational Efficiency The largest money whale in institutional finance just made its biggest move by launching a new money market fund on Ethereum, and it’s coming from J.P. Morgan Asset Management. According to an analyst known as Milk Road on X, the company oversees roughly $4 trillion in client assets, and seeds these funds with $100 million of its own capital before opening them up to the public. This fund is called My On-Chain Net Yield Fund (MONY), which is similar to a normal money market fund. Related Reading: Ethereum Emerges As A Dollar Settlement Powerhouse, Outpacing Traditional Payment Networks – Details It is set to hold assets designed to preserve capital and remain liquid. A key difference between the fund and others is that shares are issued and tracked on ETH using JPMorgan’s Kinexys platform. The feature allows the fund to settle faster, issue and redeem shares continuously, and transfer ownership without waiting on the traditional clearing system. Furthermore, this product is limited to large investors, individuals with at least $5 million investments, and institutions with $25 million, including a $1 million minimum to get started. The risk profile and purpose are familiar, and it’s a safe yield for investors. Meanwhile, for JPMorgan, this is a major operational upgrade offering faster cash transactions, tighter integration with treasury systems, and smoother collateral movement. Larger asset managers are starting by moving the safest, most conservative products on-chain first, because that’s where efficiency gains would show up immediately. “Adoption is accelerating,” Milk Road noted. Why Ethereum Is More Than Just Technology According to AdrianoFeria, the world’s greatest misunderstanding of Ethereum is viewing it solely as a technology. AdrianoFeria has pointed out that ETH is a network of economic actors coordinating around shared rules. It is also a social contract and a system that is designed to enable collaboration in the most adverse situations. Related Reading: Here’s Why Ethereum Emerges As The Global Capital Rails For On-Chain Finance At the core, ETH functions as a global and neutral arbitrator. Over time, it has proven itself to be the most long-standing, reliable, and trustworthy neutral arbitrator in the world. This arbitrator is the most valuable aspect of ETH, and any valuable model must account for it to have a chance of estimating realistic ETH price targets. “If you are stuck with a cash flow-centric valuation for ETH, then it is time to sit down and study the system more deeply, and if you believe cash flow explains most of ETH’s value, you haven’t dug deep enough,” the expert mentioned.

    "body": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets have witnessed a sharp retrace during the last 24 hours, which has resulted in a long squeeze on derivatives exchanges. Crypto Long Liquidations Have Neared $600 Million During The Past Day According to data from CoinGlass, the latest sharp price action in the cryptocurrency market has accompanied a huge amount of liquidations over at the derivatives side of the sector. Related Reading: US Bitcoin Session Leads December Returns After Weak November “Liquidation” here naturally refers to the forceful closure that any open contract has to undergo after it has amassed losses of a certain degree. For long investors, this happens when the asset’s price drops, while for shorts, liquidation occurs after a surge. How much the cryptocurrency will have to move in one direction to liquidate a specific position comes down to the percentage threshold defined by the platform and the amount of leverage that the trader has opted for. During sharp price swings, positions with high amounts of leverage attached are the first to go. Bitcoin and other assets have faced some notable volatility during the past day, which has once again caught out traders on the derivatives market. As the table below shows, liquidations have crossed $650 million over the last 24 hours. About $584 million of these liquidations involved long positions alone. That’s equivalent to almost 90% of the total, showcasing how disproportionate the price volatility has been during this period. In terms of the individual symbols, the largest contributor to the liquidation event has been Ethereum, not Bitcoin, as is often the case. With over $235 million in contracts involved, Ethereum has notably outpaced Bitcoin, which has witnessed $186 million in liquidations. ETH facing more liquidations is likely due to the fact that its price drawdown has been stronger during the past day. Out of the altcoins, Solana has come out on top with $37 million in positions flushed, ahead of XRP ($16 million) and Dogecoin ($12 million). Interestingly, SOL has outperformed the two despite its losses being more limited. In some other news, the latest Bitcoin decline has meant that its price has fallen back under a key on-chain price level, as the chart shared by analytics firm Glassnode shows. The level in question is the Active Realized Price, corresponding to the cost basis of the active participants on the Bitcoin network. Currently, it’s located at $87,900, which is above the cryptocurrency’s spot price.

    "title": "SEC Wraps Up Investigation Into Aave Protocol, Confirms CEO Stani Kulechov",
    "body": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially concluded its investigation into the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Aave (AAVE), marking a significant development in the ongoing evolution of regulatory approaches within the cryptocurrency industry. Stani Kulechov, the founder and CEO of the Aave protocol, confirmed the end of the four-year investigation in a post on social media, expressing relief and optimism about the future of DeFi. Aave Founder Celebrates End Of SEC Investigation In his announcement, Kulechov emphasized the considerable effort and resources invested by the Aave team throughout this process. He stated, “We are finally ready to share that the SEC has concluded its investigation into the Aave Protocol.” Highlighting the impact of regulatory scrutiny on DeFi, he added, “This process demanded significant effort… to protect Aave, its ecosystem, and DeFi more broadly.” Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Suffer A 20% Decline After Japan’s Rate Hike? Historical Patterns Suggest So Kulechov expressed hope for a new chapter in which developers can freely innovate and contribute to the future of finance, asserting, “DeFi will win.” This conclusion is notable against the backdrop of heightened regulatory pressure that DeFi projects have faced in recent years. Under the previous SEC chair, Gary Gensler, the agency made a concerted effort to enforce regulations in the crypto space. In 2021, the SEC initiated 19 enforcement actions related to cryptocurrency in just the first nine months. However, recent patterns reveal a substantial shift in the commission’s stance on crypto enforcement. SEC Eases Crypto Enforcement Actions By Over 60% Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, the SEC has reportedly eased enforcement actions in over 60% of ongoing cryptocurrency cases. A New York Times investigation published recently analyzed thousands of government documents and court records, revealing that the SEC has either dismissed, paused, or reduced penalties for a significant majority of active crypto cases since January 20, 2021. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecast: Key Factors That Could Propel It To $3 In Early 2026 While Trump’s first term saw an average of one high-profile cryptocurrency case per month—including the notable action against Ripple Labs—the current landscape indicates a less aggressive regulatory approach for major players like Binance, Ripple, and Gemini. Following the administration shift, enforcement actions against these companies have either been withdrawn or significantly softened. Paul S. Atkins, the newly appointed SEC chair under the Trump administration, has labeled this regulatory shift a “new day” for the cryptocurrency industry. At the time of writing, the protocol’s native token, AAVE, was trading at $187, having only surged by 1% following the announcement. However, on a year-to-date basis, the AAVE token has seen a significant 52% drop, with prices currently 72% down from the all-time high of $661 reached in May 2021.

    "title": "XRP’s Price Action Sends A Warning Despite Positive ETF Flows",
    "body": "Despite recent positive closes from spot XRP ETFs, the cryptocurrency’s price action is sending a clear warning to traders. Market structure remains weak, and without signs of a confirmed reversal, short-term risks persist. XRP’s current behavior highlights that bullish sentiment from ETFs alone isn’t enough to drive a sustained rally, making caution essential for anyone entering the market. New Year Volatility Hits Crypto Markets Hard Efloud, in a recent update, highlighted that with the start of the new year and continued uncertainty across the markets, cryptocurrencies have once again been among the hardest hit. Low trading volume and a lack of clear direction have kept pressure on the sector, and without an obvious reversal signal, altcoins continue to grind lower day by day. Related Reading: XRP Dominates Institutional Inflows, But Why Is Price Still Low? Given this backdrop, caution remains essential. As emphasized in previous analyses, any attempt to trade against the prevailing trend at support levels should be backed by clear bullish breakout structures on lower timeframes. Without such confirmation, moves higher are more likely to be short-lived reactions rather than meaningful reversals. From a technical standpoint, XRP’s price has now lost the “Daily Imb” zone, weakening the overall structure. If price dips below the most recent swing low and then attracts buying interest, the $1.98 area is expected to act as the first major resistance. As previously noted, the outlook remains negative unless the YO region is reclaimed. Beyond $1.98, another key resistance lies within the red boxed zone. Together, $1.98, the YO area, and the red boxed region form three critical hurdles where price is likely to face selling pressure in the near term. Price Action Still Outweighs ETF Optimism According to Efloud, while spot XRP ETFs have posted positive closes for 18 consecutive days, this development alone does not outweigh what the chart itself is signaling. He emphasized that price action and market structure remain the most important factors. Until these begin to shift in a clearly bullish direction, any purchases are better seen as part of a gradual accumulation strategy rather than a confirmation of a trend reversal. Related Reading: XRP Price Needs To Hold This Macro Support For Hope Of Revival From this perspective, these buys are primarily aimed at averaging down while the market searches for a more stable structure. Efloud added that if market suppression continues and a sharper correction unfolds, the area around $1.53 could emerge as a potential buy zone. However, this scenario depends on broader market behavior and is not a certainty. Finally, the analyst clarified that the $1.53 level was illustrated as a hypothetical example. Efloud warned that entering positions at support zones or key levels without observing clear breakout or reversal structures carries added risk and should be approached with caution.

    "title": "XRP Price Must Defend This Level To Avoid 50% Breakdown, Analyst Warns",
    "body": "As the crypto market recovers from the latest pullback, XRP is attempting to climb up from its recent lows. Some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency must defend its current levels or risk a 50% drop to levels not seen since 2024. Related Reading: Solana Leads As Most Popular Blockchain Ecosystem For Second Consecutive Year – Report XRP At Make-Or-Break Level Amid the start-of-week market correction, XRP recorded a 6% drop toward its lowest level in weeks. The price lost $2.00 support on Monday morning and continued to lose key levels despite uninterrupted institutional interest. The cryptocurrency has been trading within the $2.00-$2.25 price range over the past month, only losing its lower boundary during the late November pullback. Monday’s correction sent the altcoin below the range’s lower support again, hitting a multi-week low of $1.88 before bouncing around an area that has been crucial for the past year. Notably, XRP has bounced from the $1.85-$1.90 support zone after every major correction since the November 2024 breakout, climbing back above the $2.00 level each time. However, some market observers have suggested that the price risks a significant correction if it is unable to hold the current levels. Ali Martinez pointed out that the cryptocurrency has fallen below its one-year price range, between the $1.92-$3.27 levels, which could lead to a 50% drop below this area. To the analyst, XRP’s price must secure a daily close above $1.92 to prevent a drop to the $1.00 support, which has not been seen in over a year. Similarly, Cheds Trading affirmed that XRP is “flirting with a high time frame breakdown.” Per the chart, the altcoin appears to be forming a high-timeframe rounding top or double top pattern with a higher high. The analyst noted that in the case of the latter, the M formation would be confirmed if the $1.88 level, where the pattern’s neckline is situated, is lost. This could lead to a “measured move to roughly [the] MA 200 area/$1.00 range.” Price Ready For 2026 Markup Phase? Despite the warnings, other market watchers shared a positive outlook for XRP in the coming months. Trader Niels affirmed that the leading altcoin is “looking good” at the current levels. According to the post, the cryptocurrency is “sweeping the $1.8 support zone again” while showing a bullish divergence on the daily timeframe, which suggests that the price could soon move to higher levels. To the trader, once XRP breaks above $2.20 resistance, it could surge 27%-37% towards the $2.80-$3.00 area “within a month.” Meanwhile, analyst ChartNerd highlighted that XRP appears to be repeating its 2023-2024 price action, which led to its massive breakout in November 2024. The chart shows that the altcoin accumulated for a year and a half, bouncing between the range’s lower and upper boundaries before its markup phase in late Q4 2024. Related Reading: XRP Hasn’t Entered A Bear Market Yet; Analyst Shares Why Following this expansion period, the cryptocurrency is showing a similar accumulation range, leading the analyst to suggest that XRP may continue consolidating within its current range before another markup phase occurs. “Regardless of scenarios, or how ugly/beautiful it gets, a massive markup phase similar to November 2024 is likely between now and late 2026,” he stated. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $1.92, a 1.65% increase in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "On-chain data shows the top 100 whales on the Chainlink network have again started accumulating the asset recently, retracing their earlier distribution. Top Chainlink Addresses Have Been Adding Since The Start Of November In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the holdings of the top Chainlink addresses. Santiment defines “top addresses” as the 100 largest wallets on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum Plunge Triggers Near-$600 Million Crypto Long Flush This category would naturally include the largest of whales on the blockchain, who carry some degree of influence due to the sheer size of their holdings. As such, the behavior of these investors may be worth monitoring. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows how the Chainlink supply held by the top addresses has changed over the last few months: The value of the metric appears to have gone up in recent weeks | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the combined supply of the 100 largest Chainlink wallets witnessed a decline in October, implying that these massive entities were participating in distribution. The selling from the top addresses first began as LINK’s price went through a sharp crash. The selloff continued until the start of November, when the indicator finally arrived at a bottom. Shortly after, the supply of the 100 largest LINK investors saw a reversal, signaling the return of accumulation. According to Santiment, these whales have collectively added 20.46 million tokens (about $263 million) to their holdings. This has not only retraced the October drawdown in their supply, but also in fact taken it to an even higher level. While the top Chainlink addresses have shown net accumulation since the start of November, the pace of buying hasn’t been constant. From the chart, it’s apparent that most of the accumulation occurred in November, with not much coming in December so far. It now remains to be seen what trend the 100 largest LINK investors will show next, and whether it will have any influence on where the cryptocurrency heads next. In some other news, Chainlink recently lost a multi-year technical support line, as analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted in an X post. As is visible in the above chart, Chainlink made two retests of this line during the first half of 2025 and each time, it found support. The retest that occurred after the latest price downtrend, however, ended up in failure, with the asset dropping below this line for the first time since 2023. Related Reading: US Bitcoin Session Leads December Returns After Weak November After the breakdown, LINK attempted to retrace it, but the retest from below also ended in rejection, a potential sign that the support may have flipped into resistance.

    "title": "The Bearish Structure That Puts Bitcoin Price At $92,550, And Then $82,000",
    "body": "Struggling under the weight of notable selling pressure, the Bitcoin price has since lost its hold on the $90,000 support, leading to a sustained downtrend through the middle of December. Despite calls for a bottom, the cryptocurrency does not seem to be heading in that direction, and some analysts have shared reasons as to why this is the case. Crypt analyst Lingrid maps out the trajectory of the Bitcoin price, showing a bullish short-term, but ultimately ending with more declines. Why The Bitcoin Price Could Crash Further Lingrid’s analysis focuses on Bitcoin’s recent price performance, having hit resistance multiple times above the $92,000 level. This comes as the digital asset is “capped below channel border,” something that is inherently bearish for the price, given the recent price action. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts How Low The XRP Price Will Go Before Bouncing The rejections between $92,500 and $93,500, according to the analyst, show that the Bitcoin price is likely to place in lower highs. Thus, even in the event of a recovery trend, this level still remains a significant roadblock to any rally. Furthermore, the crypto analyst adds that the recent slowdown in the Bitcoin price action has pushed it into a tight compression. With the price still sitting above the rising support line while this happens, Lingrid believes that this shows Bitcoin is entering into a state of equilibrium, and not strength. Usually, this means that the Bitcoin price could be headed for “directional expansion.” Presently, all eyes are on the bears and sellers as the Bitcoin price struggles to hold support. There is still the possibility that the price will rise to $92,500 before facing a rejection. In this scenario, it would trigger further decline toward $82,000 to put in lower lows. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Still Hit $140,000? What The Global M2 Money Supply Says There is also the possibility that the digital asset does escape this bearish scenario, but the buyers would have to step back in the ring. Mainly, the Bitcoin price must break out and then hold above the channel, sustaining a move above $92,500. If this plays out, then Lingrid believes that the bearish thesis could be invalidated. Such a case would mean that the Bitcoin focus shifts back toward $100,000. However, with the price currently trending below $90,000 and sentiment being mostly negative, the chances of an invalidation remain slim. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "5,606 Bitcoin: Lightning Network Sets Fresh Capacity Record",
    "body": "Lightning Network capacity hit a new high this week as major exchanges put more Bitcoin into off-chain channels, boosting the network’s total liquidity and changing how users move BTC. Related Reading: Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund Exchange Support Drives Capacity According to reports, the Lightning Network’s public capacity climbed to about 5,606 BTC, with some trackers briefly showing a peak near 5,637 BTC. That is a clear uptick from earlier levels and marks the highest recorded total so far. Exchanges including Binance and OKX have been named as contributors that added Bitcoin to Lightning channels, and other platforms such as Kraken and Bitfinex are expanding their support as well. These deposits are aimed at speeding up deposits and withdrawals and cutting fees for customers. Network Activity Vs. Public Nodes Based on reports, that increase in capacity has not been matched by a big rise in the number of public nodes or channels. Public node counts sit near 14,940, while public channels are roughly 48,678. In other words, more Bitcoin is available inside the network, but the number of hands handling traffic has not jumped in the same way. Some of this extra liquidity is concentrated in larger, custodial channels run by exchanges, which can move big sums without creating many new public routes. That makes on-chain metrics a bit harder to read. Transaction counts and on-chain fee savings do show real user benefits, even when the node graph looks stable. A separate figure that shows real usage is the share of exchange traffic routed over Lightning. Based on reports, one exchange has routed around 15% of its Bitcoin transactions via Lightning rails after adopting Lightning integrations, pointing to meaningful operational changes at major platforms. New Use Cases And Funding Funding and protocol work are following capacity growth. Tether led a round that raised about $8 million for a startup focused on payments over Lightning, indicating interest in stablecoin flows on the network. Announcing Taproot Assets v0.7, now with reusable addresses, a fully auditable asset supply, and larger, more reliable transactions. ✅ With this release, we are laying the foundation for trillions of dollars to flow on bitcoin and Lightning. 💸 Read more below. Upgrade today! — Lightning Labs⚡️🌐 (@lightning) December 16, 2025 Protocol upgrades — including work around Taproot-related asset handling and reliability improvements — are also being rolled out to support more varied payments and token types. These developments point to Lightning being used for things beyond tiny tips: remittances, merchant payments, and stablecoin transfers are being tested more widely. Related Reading: TechCrunch Founder Names XRP Among His Largest Crypto Positions Market watchers say this mix of exchange liquidity, developer upgrades, and rising on-platform usage could make Lightning a more practical rail for everyday BTC movement. Some critics warn that heavier reliance on custodial channels raises centralization risks and reduces the visibility of true peer-to-peer routing. Others note that improved user experience, lower costs, and faster finality are what ordinary users will notice first. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has revealed the next Bitcoin price level he is looking to accumulate at in anticipation of a relief rally. Despite plans to buy BTC, the analyst indicated that he is still bearish on the flagship crypto in the long term, with a larger decline expected to unfold. Analyst Reveals The Next Buy Level As Bitcoin Price Eyes Bounce In an X post, Doctor Profit stated that he is buying BTC around $86,000 as he looks to trade a short-term relief bounce. He reiterated that he sees the probability of the Bitcoin price revisiting the $97,000 to $107,000 region before the next major leg lower unfolds. The analyst added that this projected move is a 20% from the current region, which presents a good risk-reward trade with a tight stop loss. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Full Technical Bitcoin Price Breakdown – Here’s The Target Doctor Profit is known to have predicted the Bitcoin price top when it was trading at around $126,000. The analyst noted that he remains very bearish in the long term, expecting further declines. As such, he plans to play this move to buy BTC with absolute and the highest form of risk management. The analyst explained that this means he will ensure to place the stop loss at entry once in solid profit, while his short trade from between $115,000 and $125,000 will still be running. Doctor Profit further remarked that this long setup for the Bitcoin price is aimed at a few weeks only, before the bearish price action resumes with lower targets. BTC Remains “Extremely Unstable And Bearish” Doctor Profit stated that the Bitcoin price remains extremely unstable and bearish for the mid-term, noting that a strong downside continuation can happen at any moment, even before the flagship crypto reaches the projected $97,000 to $107,000 zone. The analyst added that a deeper and faster sell-off is absolutely possible, so those looking to buy now should take extreme caution. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Still Hit $140,000? What The Global M2 Money Supply Says Doctor Profit reiterated that his short positions remain fully open, as any upside is treated as distribution and liquidity for the next leg down. The analyst noted that the $70,000 region remains the main target. If the Bitcoin price manages to revisit the $97,000 to $107,000 region, he stated that he would fully take profit again on the position and add the profits to his short position. In the meantime, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has warned that the Bitcoin price needs to hold the $87,000 region or risk dropping to as low as $70,000. BTC is currently on the edge with Japan set to raise its interest rates this week. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $86,600, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "Russia has reiterated its firm stance on crypto, drawing a clear distinction between digital assets and traditional currency. While global debate continues over whether crypto can coexist with national currencies, Russian lawmakers are reinforcing a long-held view. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Death Cross’ Panic Returns: History Says It’s A Late Signal Inside the country, payments remain the sole domain of the ruble. The position comes as crypto usage grows worldwide and as Russia experiments with alternative settlement tools for cross-border trade under pressure from sanctions. At the center of the latest comments is Anatoly Aksakov, chair of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets and a key figure behind Russia’s crypto legislation. Speaking to state media, Aksakov said there is no ambiguity in the law. BTC's price records some gains on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Lawmakers Reinforce Ruble-only Payment Rule In Russia, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum can be held or traded as investments, but they are not permitted to function as a means of payment in domestic commerce, according to lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov. All payments for goods and services must continue to be settled in rubles. Aksakov’s remarks restate provisions introduced in Russia’s 2020 digital assets law, which removed cryptocurrencies from any form of legal tender. Lawmakers argue that money must be issued and controlled by the state, and private digital currencies do not meet that standard. Officials say there are no plans to soften this stance. The rule applies across retail, online services, and business contracts, closing the door on crypto payments regardless of adoption trends or market conditions. Central Bank Skepticism Shapes Policy The Bank of Russia continues to play a decisive role in this approach. Governor Elvira Nabiullina has long warned that cryptocurrencies pose risks to financial stability and consumer protection. The central bank has consistently opposed using crypto as a medium of exchange and has previously pushed for broad restrictions on exchanges and transactions. This position has led to years of friction with the Ministry of Finance, which favored regulation and taxation over outright limits. While several legislative proposals emerged from that debate, none altered the core prohibition on crypto payments. Today, policymakers appear to be aligned in preserving the ruble’s monopoly. Cross-Border Use Grows Despite Domestic Ban Although crypto is barred from internal payments, Russian authorities acknowledge its growing role in international trade. Businesses are permitted to use digital assets for cross-border settlements under an experimental legal regime, a workaround that has gained traction amid global financial restrictions. Officials estimate that billions of dollars’ worth of trade has already moved through such channels. Similarly, Russia has legalized cryptocurrency mining and is tightening oversight of the sector, underscoring a split strategy, limited use abroad, and strict control at home.

Digital assets may serve as investment tools or external settlement instruments, but inside the country, the ruble remains the only means of payment.

    "body": "Michael Saylor’s firm Strategy continues to make Bitcoin headlines with its enormous purchases, making it one of the largest holders in the world. Related Reading: TechCrunch Founder Names XRP Among His Largest Crypto Positions Reports show the company owns 671,268 Bitcoin, roughly 3.2% of the total supply, valued at about $58.61 billion at the time of publication, according to Saylor Tracker. Bitcoin entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said on his podcast that it would be extremely difficult for any other public company to match Strategy’s buying pace. Massive Holdings And Recent Purchase Strategy announced a fresh buy of 10,645 Bitcoin for $980.3 million, paying an average of $92,098 per coin. That move pushed its total hoard to roughly 3.2% of all Bitcoin in existence. Those are large figures. They also show why rivals would need huge sums to close the gap. Pompliano On The Scale Needed To Compete According to comments made on The Pomp Podcast, Pompliano said that a company trying to match Strategy would have to “raise hundreds of billions of dollars.” He said it would be “very hard to see that happening.” He pointed to Strategy’s early entry in 2020, when Saylor’s initial purchase was about $500 million while Bitcoin traded between $9,000 and $10,000. That initial stake, based on current prices cited in reports, is now worth more than $4.8 billion with Bitcoin trading around $86,950. Market Impact And Buying Method Market watchers have flagged Strategy’s growing share as something to watch. Some worry a single large holder could influence price moves. Others note the firm does most of its buying through over-the-counter desks. OTC trades are used to handle big orders without sending shockwaves through exchange order books. Many investors see the regular, large purchases as a positive sign for Bitcoin demand. Holding Strategy And Influence Concerns Pompliano described 3.2% as “a big number, but it’s also a small number.” He added, “It’s not like they own 10%.” That view captures a split: the holding is large enough to matter for supply dynamics and market psychology, but not so large that it gives absolute control. Still, the combination of size and repeated buys draws attention from traders and regulators alike. Outlook And Long Term Plans Reports quote Strategy’s CEO Phong Lee as saying the company probably won’t sell any Bitcoin until at least 2065. Saylor has also posted that he plans on “buying the top forever.” Those statements reinforce a long-term stance rather than short-term trading. The market tends to treat such commitments as bullish, and many participants adjust expectations for future demand accordingly.

Based on current numbers and public comments, it will be difficult for another listed company to match that level of accumulation without very large capital raises or a dramatic change in corporate behavior. The pace set by Strategy is likely to keep drawing attention from investors watching supply and demand for Bitcoin. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Structure Turns Bearish As Structural Indicators Flip Negative",
    "body": "Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim the $90,000 level as it continues to test critical demand around the $86,000 zone. After weeks of corrective price action, bulls are finding it increasingly difficult to build a convincing case for trend continuation. Related Reading: XRP Liquidity Dries Up: Futures Buy Volume On Binance Falls from $5.8B to $250M Momentum has faded, upside attempts have been rejected, and market confidence is weakening. As a result, a growing number of analysts are beginning to openly discuss the possibility that Bitcoin is transitioning into a broader bear market phase rather than a temporary pullback within a larger uptrend. This shift in narrative is supported by structural data. In a recent analysis, Axel Adler highlights that Bitcoin’s price action is now aligned with a clear deterioration in market structure. His chart, which combines a composite Structure Shift signal with a Donchian Channel, shows that the indicator has decisively moved into negative territory. The Structure Shift composite ranges from -1 to +1, with values below zero signaling bearish regime dominance. Currently, the signal sits near -0.5, a level historically associated with sustained downside pressure rather than short-lived corrections. At the same time, Bitcoin price has dropped to the lower boundary of the 21-day Donchian Channel and is hovering just above the $85,000 support area. Together, these signals suggest that the market is operating in a risk-off environment, where downside risks remain elevated unless structure improves meaningfully. Bitcoin Structure Confirms Bearish Regime Adler notes that the current position of the Structure Shift composite signal confirms Bitcoin has firmly established itself within a bearish structural zone. With the indicator sitting below zero, the market is no longer in a neutral or transitional phase but operating under sustained downside conditions. According to this framework, the primary trigger for improvement would be a decisive recovery of the composite signal back above the zero threshold, ideally while price continues to hold support within the Donchian Channel. Without that shift, any short-term bounce risks remaining corrective rather than trend-changing. This bearish structure is reinforced by Bitcoin’s Bull-Bear market structure index, which focuses on derivatives dynamics through fast and slow regime components. The latest data shows the bullish component collapsing to just 5%, an extremely low reading that reflects the near absence of constructive long-side momentum. At the same time, the fast bearish component has moved deeper into negative territory, signaling rising seller pressure driven primarily by the futures market. This configuration highlights a critical imbalance. Short-term momentum is firmly controlled by bears, while spot demand has so far proven insufficient to absorb derivatives-led selling pressure. For conditions to improve, the bullish component of the index would need to recover meaningfully, signaling renewed participation from buyers. Taken together, both indicators point to the same conclusion: Bitcoin has undergone a local structural shift into bearish territory. The dominant risk remains continued downside pressure driven by derivatives, especially in the absence of strong spot accumulation. Related Reading: Who Really Sold The Dip? On-Chain Data Exposes Bitcoin’s True Sellers Bitcoin Price Tests Critical Support as Downtrend Persists Bitcoin continues to trade under clear downside pressure. The price now hovers around the $86,500 level after failing to reclaim higher resistance zones. The chart highlights a decisive breakdown below the short- and medium-term moving averages. With BTC trading well beneath the 50-day and 100-day averages. These levels, which previously acted as dynamic support during the uptrend, have now flipped into resistance. Reinforcing the bearish market structure. The most notable technical development is Bitcoin’s interaction with the 200-day moving average, shown in red. Price has briefly tested this long-term support but remains fragile, with follow-through buying notably absent. Historically, sustained trading below faster-moving averages while compressing near the 200-day often signals either a prolonged consolidation phase or the risk of an additional leg lower if demand fails to appear.

For bulls to regain control, BTC must first stabilize above current demand and reclaim key moving averages. Signaling that sellers are losing dominance.

    "body": "Ethereum’s (ETH) recent pullback is starting to reflect more than short-term price volatility. As ETH trades below the $3,000 mark, a combination of heavy liquidations, declining network activity, and sustained institutional outflows is reinforcing concerns about weakening demand. Related Reading: Chainlink’s Top Whales Reverse Course, Quietly Scoop Up $263M In LINK While prices have so far held above key support levels, multiple indicators suggest that selling pressure remains firmly in place, leaving the market in a cautious holding pattern. Over the past week, Ethereum has fallen roughly 12%, underperforming several major assets during a broader market correction. The drop pushed ETH briefly toward the $2,850–$2,900 zone, triggering over $200 million in liquidation, one of the largest liquidation events in recent months. ETH's price trends slightly upwards on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Network Activity and Ethereum ETF Flows Signal Waning Participation Beyond price action, Ethereum’s on-chain metrics are showing signs of cooling participation. Weekly active addresses fell from around 440,000 earlier in the quarter to roughly 324,000 in December, marking the lowest level since May. Transaction counts have also dropped to mid-year lows, pointing to reduced engagement from both retail and institutional users. At the same time, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs continue to see persistent outflows. Data from SoSoValue shows more than $224 million exiting ETH ETFs over several consecutive sessions, led primarily by BlackRock’s ETHA fund. Since mid-December, the total net assets across U.S. spot ETH ETFs have declined by more than $3 billion, suggesting that institutions are trimming their exposure rather than adding to positions. The Coinbase Premium Index turning negative further supports the view that U.S.-based selling pressure has returned. Whale Selling and Technical Structure Keep Risks Skewed Lower Large holders have added to near-term pressure. On-chain data shows more than 28,500 ETH sold by a handful of whale wallets within a short period, including transactions exceeding $80 million in total value. Despite this distribution, ETH has so far avoided a sharp breakdown, with buyers repeatedly defending levels near $2,880. From a technical standpoint, Ethereum remains in a medium-term downtrend. Price continues to trade below key moving averages, while momentum indicators such as RSI remain below neutral levels.

    "title": "Dogecoin Breakdown Ahead? Analyst Flags 2022-Style Signal",
    "body": "Dogecoin may be lining up for a deeper breakdown even if Bitcoin manages a short-term bounce, according to pseudonymous analyst VisionPulsed, who argues that a familiar 2022-style pattern is re-emerging across majors and memecoins. In a video published December 16, the analyst frames the near-term setup around Bitcoin’s daily stochastic RSI, which is moving from overbought back toward oversold. Over the past two months, every such reset on the daily chart has coincided with fresh lows in price. This time, he says, the structure is slightly different — and that matters for how Dogecoin trades the next leg. Dogecoin Bull Need To Watch Bitcoin’s Stochastic Reset On Bitcoin, VisionPulsed notes that the daily stochastic RSI is now “approaching oversold” after a stretch at elevated levels. In October, November and early December, similar full cycles from overbought to oversold on the daily timeframe were accompanied by Bitcoin making new lows. “This is actually the first time that the stock RSI is going from overbought to oversold and we may not make a new low,” he says, emphasizing that it is still “too early” to call it. If price instead prints a higher low as the oscillator resets, he argues that would signal a short- to medium-term trend reversal rather than a macro regime change, opening the door for a relief rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Selloff Tests Long-Held Beliefs as Traders Debate Capitulation or Reset “If we do see a higher low form on the price as the stock RSI resets, then you should get the green light for a relief rally,” he adds. If the current low breaks instead, the rally “is down to hell where you belong,” as he puts it, underscoring that the bullish case hinges on that higher-low structure holding on the daily chart. Dogecoin, in his view, is where the setup turns dangerous. While Bitcoin is attempting to carve out a higher low, Dogecoin continues to print lower lows on the same timeframe. VisionPulsed links this to a similar divergence in 2022, when Doge bled lower throughout the month while Bitcoin quietly based and formed higher lows. “Very similar to 2022,” he says, adding that Bitcoin is, as of the recording, making “a higher low even though Dogecoin is not.” That pattern, he argues, suggests Doge could still catch a relief move if Bitcoin rallies, but from a much weaker starting point. How Low Can DOGE Price Go? In such a scenario, he sketches a rally “probably somewhere up here to grab the peanut,” placing that so-called “peanut zone” roughly around the $0.20 area in January. He calls that level “probably your last chance to do whatever you’re going to do” before Dogecoin, in his base case, resumes its downtrend and heads “down to feed the pig pen” — his shorthand for a deeper capitulation move to new lows in the $0.05 to $0.06 area. The base case for Dogecoin is a deeper retracement. He says. “We’re coming down to feed the little piggies. Oink oink.” Until Doge breaks its current downtrend, he sees “no reason to assume it’s bullish.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Rare Weekly RSI Level Seen Only 4 Times In 11 Years The timing, in his framework, is anchored on Bitcoin’s position inside the lower band of a 7–8 day Gaussian channel and the interaction of several moving averages. He notes that Bitcoin has already spent close to four weeks in this “peanut gallery” zone, versus roughly 63 days during the 2022 accumulation period. If Bitcoin is still hovering near the upper range of the current structure by late January, he argues, “you’re pretty much recreating 2022,” which in his view would likely be followed by a capitulation leg lower. A key signal to watch, he says, is the convergence of a white and a green moving average, which in the 2022 template marked the “point of no return before Bitcoin collapsed.” Those lines are now projected to converge in late January or early February. Once they meet, his base case is that Bitcoin gets “sent through the blue moving average” to test a red moving average in the $50,000–$60,000 zone as a minimum downside target. That, in his scenario, is when Dogecoin finally goes down to the $0.05 area. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.12974. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "UK Crypto Ownership Takes Biggest Hit Since 2021, Regulator Says",
    "body": "According to new research commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority, the share of UK adults who hold cryptocurrencies has fallen to 8% in 2025, down from 12% a year earlier. Related Reading: Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund Survey Shows Smaller Numbers Holding Crypto Fieldwork for the FCA study ran from 5th August to 2nd September 2025, using a YouGov online panel to collect a nationally representative sample of 2,353 interviews plus a boosted sample of people who own or previously owned crypto. Awareness of cryptocurrencies remains high at 91%, even as fewer people report owning them. The drop marks the first fall in overall ownership in the last four years, although ownership is still about double the level recorded in 2021. That suggests some people who held small amounts have pulled back while a core of larger holders remains active. Average Holdings Have Increased Reports have disclosed that the mix of holdings has shifted upward. The proportion of holders with crypto worth between £1,001 and £5,000 rose to over 20%, and those with holdings of £5,001 to £10,000 increased to around 10%. At the same time, reported small holdings under £100 have declined. Many users also reported net gains in 2025, with a majority saying their portfolios rose in value over the year. Among people who still hold crypto, Bitcoin is the most common asset at 57%, followed by Ether at 43%. Other tokens are far less widely held, though Solana registers with about 21% of holders. These figures point to concentration in a few large names even as overall participation shrinks. Regulators Move To Tighten Rules The FCA published this research as part of a broader push to bring the sector under clearer rules. The regulator has launched consultations on proposals covering trading platforms, market safeguards and rules for staking, lending and custody. Reports show the consultation process is part of a wider government plan that aims to start formal regulation of cryptoassets by October 2027. What This Means For Markets And Consumers Traders and platforms will likely watch these trends closely. A smaller base of retail owners can mean less retail-driven volatility, but it can also reduce everyday familiarity with crypto in the wider public.

The FCA’s work on clearer rules comes amid growing government attention to market integrity and consumer protection. In short, fewer Britons now report owning crypto, yet those who remain tend to hold larger sums and favor the top coins. The figures from the FCA suggest a market that is thinning at the edges while concentration and regulatory scrutiny rise. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "Bitcoin has entered a critical make-or-break phase as price clings to key weekly support while momentum continues to fade. Despite holding above a major confluence zone, repeated rejections overhead suggest buyers are losing control. With macro pressure building and liquidity levels still untested, the next move from here could define whether BTC stabilizes or slides into a deeper reset. Lower-Timeframe Rejection Keeps The Downtrend In Control Crypto analyst Michael Van De Poppe revealed in a recent post that Bitcoin has faced a clear rejection at a key resistance level. This failure signals that the short-term downtrend remains intact on lower timeframes, confirming that selling pressure currently outweighs buying momentum in the immediate term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Structure Weakens As Inter-Exchange Liquidity Touches Red Zone – Details To flip this short-term bias, Van de Poppe expects a clear breakout above the $88,000 level. A successful move above this mark would serve as a strong, unequivocal signal to the markets that the corrective phase is over and that upward momentum is likely to take hold from that point forward. If buyers fail to achieve this necessary breakout, it remains highly probable that the price will pursue liquidity targets below, specifically targeting a test at $83,000 for liquidity. Should that fail, a further descent to the $80,000 level will trigger stop-losses. Finally, Van De Poppe connected the technical outlook to the broader economic environment. Given the high volume of macroeconomic events scheduled to take place over the course of the week, such as FOMC, Poppe believes that the market could experience significant volatility and end up reaching one of the predicted downside liquidity tests. $93,000 Rejection Stalls Momentum, but Weekly Structure Still Intact According to a weekly chart update by Crypto Damus, Bitcoin recently faced a firm rejection at the $93,000 resistance level. Despite that setback, price action remains constructive for now, with BTC holding above the crucial $86,000 weekly support zone. This area is reinforced with the key 100-week moving average confluence, making it an important level to watch in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Faces Potential 60% Decline As Expert Warns Of ‘Major Bull Trap’ That said, the broader structure still leaves room for deeper downside. Crypto Damus notes that a full retracement toward the rising wedge breakdown target cannot be ruled out, which aligns closely with the April low around the $78,000 region. A move into that zone would represent a more pronounced corrective phase within the larger cycle. Looking further ahead, a deeper bear-market-style retest may ultimately present a more attractive long-term opportunity. A revisit of the $70,000 level is highlighted as a potential high-conviction buying area, should the market extend its pullback. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",
