    "body": "Ethereum price started a recovery wave above $2,95 0. ETH is now consolidating and might soon attempt another recovery wave if it clears $3,050. Ethereum started a decent upward move above the $2,950 zone. The price is trading above $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $2,920 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above the $3,050 zone. Ethereum Price Eyes More Gains Ethereum price started a decent increase from $2,775, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to surpass the $2,850 and $2,880 resistance levels to enter a positive zone. The bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,175 swing high to the $2,775 low. Moreover, there was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $2,920 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . If there is another upward move, the price could face resistance near the $3,020 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,175 swing high to the $2,775 low. The next key resistance is near the $3,050 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,080 level. A clear move above the $3,080 resistance might send the price toward the $3,150 resistance. An upside break above the $3,150 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,220 resistance zone or even $3,250 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,050 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,950 level. The first major support sits near the $2,915 zone. A clear move below the $2,915 support might push the price toward the $2,880 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,840 region. The next key support sits at $2,800. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone. Major Support Level – $2,915 Major Resistance Level – $3,050",

    "body": "Fidelity’s top markets strategist has warned that Bitcoin’s October high of $126,000 could mark the top of the current cycle, and investors should be ready for a rough ride in 2026. Related Reading: Banks Could Favor A Higher XRP Price, Finance Expert Says According to Jurrien Timmer, a notable pullback is possible next year with key support seen in a range of $65,000 to $75,000. That view sits alongside data points and trader commentary that recall past big drops after sharp peaks. Cycle Warning From Fidelity According to Timmer, Bitcoin’s price history follows a roughly four-year rhythm tied to halvings. Past peaks have been followed by steep corrections of about 70 to 85%. For example, after a high of $1,137 in 2013 the price slipped to roughly $230, and the 2017 peak near $14,050 later traded down toward $3,415. Prices surged again after 2021, and that pattern of parabolic advance then sharp retreat has been repeated. Some traders say those falls are tests of patience rather than a sign the story is broken. Fidelity Warns: #Bitcoin Cycle Peak May Already Be In Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer believes the $126K October high was the top for this cycle. Based on $BTC 4-year halving pattern, He expects 2026 to be a down year, with support around $65K–$75K. Short-Term Pain, Long-Term… pic.twitter.com/t9wNeF5lTo — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) December 21, 2025 Historical Charts Show Parabolic Moves Reports have disclosed that long-term log charts help put these swings in perspective by showing percentage growth across cycles, which can make big-dollar moves easier to read. Market action often looks like a rapid climb to a peak, a quick drop, and a long period where prices move sideways and gains feel slow. Those sideways stretches are where many long-term holders are rewarded, though it can take years. BTC will hit $250k by year-end 2027. 2026 is too chaotic to predict, though Bitcoin making new all-time highs in 2026 is still possible. Options markets are currently pricing about equal odds of $70k or $130k for month-end June 2026, and equal odds of $50k or $250k by year-end… — Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) December 21, 2025 Galaxy Research has flagged overlapping macro and market risks that make forecasting harder for 2026, and options and volatility trends suggest Bitcoin is behaving more like a macro asset than a pure growth gamble. Galaxy Research is still bullish on a multi-year view and projects a path toward $250,000 by the end of 2027. First Quarter Patterns May Matter Related Reading: Before You Sell Bitcoin For Gold, Hear This Warning Based on reports from traders, the first quarter has in past cycles been a period that often supports price stability, although recent years have shown less regularity. Large inflows and treasury buys that could arrive in 2025 might be offset by early-cycle selling from big holders. The balance between institutional demand and whale supply will likely show itself in the first half of 2026, making that stretch important for whether historical four-year rhythms hold firm.

    "title": "Fundstrat Predicts Ethereum Drop To $1,800 In H1 2026",
    "body": "A screenshot attributed to Fundstrat Research is stirring debate over whether Tom Lee’s firm is projecting a sharp first-half 2026 correction in crypto markets—despite Lee’s recent public bullishness on Ethereum. Wu Blockchain shared the image via X, describing it as an internal client note titled “2026 Crypto Outlook: Near-Term Headwinds, Second-Half Upside,” timestamped Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025 at 7:34 p.m. ET. Fundstrat’s Bearish Call Vs. Tom Lee’s Bull Case The document is credited to Sean Farrell, Fundstrat’s head of digital asset strategy, and includes a base-case scenario calling for a “meaningful drawdown in 1H 2026,” with target ranges of bitcoin at $60,000–$65,000, ether at $1,800–$2,000, and solana at $50–$75. The note adds that those levels would represent “attractive opportunities into year-end,” and that if the view is wrong, the preference is still to “play defense” until strength is confirmed. The ETH range is what set the market chatter off. Ether is trading around the $3,000 area, making $1,800 a material downside scenario if taken at face value. Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Record Over $600M In Outflows — Warning Signal For Traders? The controversy, such as it is, comes from the proximity to Lee’s own messaging. At Binance Blockchain Week, Lee said ethereum at roughly $3,000 looked “severely undervalued,” a stance that reads very differently than a research framework explicitly mapping a potential move to the high-$1,000s. Over the past few weeks, Lee even publicly shared his predictions that ETH could reach $20,000 next year and $62,000 over the next several years. Farrell responded directly on X on Dec. 20, arguing the framing of “internal conflict” misunderstands how Fundstrat operates. The firm, he said, houses several analysts with independent processes, each designed for different client objectives and time horizons. Lee’s work, Farrell wrote, is aimed at large institutions that might allocate 1%–5% to BTC and ETH and is structured around longer-term macro and “secular” trends. Farrell’s research, by contrast, is positioned for investors with heavier crypto exposure—he referenced portfolios with ~20%+ allocations—where active risk management and rebalancing matter more than maintaining a single long-duration thesis through volatility. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Outflows Soar To $978M: Sign Of Dip Buying? That distinction is central to interpreting the leaked-style targets. Farrell’s public explanation wasn’t “we are bearish,” but rather “we are cautious in the near term.” He said markets appear priced for “near-perfection” while risks remain elevated—citing government shutdown dynamics, trade volatility, uncertainty around AI capex, and a Federal Reserve chair transition, alongside tight high-yield spreads and low cross-asset volatility. He also highlighted mixed flow conditions. In Farrell’s telling, long-term ETF demand could improve as wirehouses onboard, but near-term pressures persist from “OG selling,” miners, fund redemptions, and even the possibility of an MSCI MicroStrategy delisting—an item that stood out because it suggests the risk lens extends beyond spot crypto into the crypto-equity complex that has become a key liquidity and sentiment barometer. Farrell’s stated base case: “an early-year bounce followed by another 1H drawdown, creating a more attractive opportunity into year-end.If I’m wrong, I’d rather wait for confirmation (trend breaks, flows, momentum, or a clear catalyst). Crypto is reflexive, and for my objective, patience matters in no-man’s land.” The thread ends on a point many readers missed in the initial screenshot-driven outrage cycle: Farrell still expects BTC and ETH to “challenge new ATHs by year-end,” describing a shorter, shallower bear that could compress the traditional four-year cycle narrative. “For those who tuned into the outlook: I still expect BTC and ETH to challenge new ATHs by year-end, effectively ending the traditional four-year cycle with a shorter, shallower bear,” he wrote via X. At press time, Ethereum traded at $3,043. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Crypto pundit BarriC has explained why an XRP rally to $1,000 is possible, even though it could mean the altcoin would have a market cap of almost $100 trillion. The pundit also raised the possibility of XRP rallying to as high as $50,000, which he described as “absolutely possible.” Why XRP Could Rally To $1,000 In an X post, BarriC stated that XRP will have to become extremely expensive so that it can be fractionalized and allocated to every bank and financial institution globally. He noted that this will be the case if every bank and financial institution around the world adopts and utilizes the altcoin. Related Reading: XRP Price About $1,000 Is A Necessity, Analyst Claims In line with this, BarriC declared that this is why a $1,000, $10,000, and $50,000 price tag is “absolutely possible” for XRP. The pundit has continued to reiterate that XRP can hit the $1,000 price target despite how ambitious it sounds, considering what the altcoin’s market cap will be. In another X post, he stated that the altcoin could still close out this year at $100 and hit $1,000 early next year. The pundit admitted that quite a few things would have to happen simultaneously, but that anything is possible in crypto. It is worth noting that finance expert Dr. Camila Stevenson recently echoed BarriC’s sentiment that XRP needs to be expensive to be easily adopted by banks for larger volumes. Meanwhile, BarriC is confident that the XRP adoption among banks is already happening. He recently noted that Swiss bank AMINA plans to start utilizing Ripple payments and, by association, XRP. The pundit also alluded to the fact that Ripple is on course to become a Trust bank after the OCC granted it a conditional approval. Other Potential Catalysts For Higher Price Crypto pundit X Finance Bull highlighted a Trump stimulus and XRP ETFs as catalysts that could drive the XRP price higher. He noted that 20% to 28% of U.S. adults now own crypto, equating to 50 to 65 million people with wallets and market impact. The pundit then raised the scenario in which a small percentage of the proposed $2,000 stimulus check flows into XRP. Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Keeps Crashing X Finance Bull declared that this will create billions in demand, hitting an already rising market. The pundit also mentioned that the infrastructure is in place as XRP ETFs keep launching and banks are onboarding. He added that liquidity finds utility, which is why he is confident that a significant amount of global liquidity could flow into the XRP ecosystem, sparking higher prices for the altcoin. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.92, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin Weekly Fractal Hints At A Bigger Move Brewing",
    "body": "Dogecoin is doing that thing again, not pumping, not capitulating, just sitting there on the weekly like it’s waiting for a cue. And if you’re the type who still believes memes have market structure like in 2017 and 2021, one chart making the rounds on X says this is exactly what the pre-run “calm” has looked like before. Crypto analyst Cryptollica (@Cryptollica) posted a weekly DOGE chart marking four major structural points across the coin’s history, arguing the current stretch maps onto prior accumulation phases. “We are looking at a textbook fractal setup,” Cryptollica wrote. “The chart highlights four distinct structural points (1, 2, 3, 4). We are currently at Point 4, and the structure is rhyming perfectly with the pre-bull run accumulation phases of the past.” Will History Repeat For Dogecoin? The pitch is basically: zoom out, stop staring at intraday noise, and look at the cycle cadence. In his framing, Zones 1 and 2 were the “boredom phases,” the stretches where volatility dried up, price rounded out a base, and the market slowly rotated from weak hands to more patient holders. Zone 2, he says, was the launchpad that ultimately led into the 2021 face-melter. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holds The Floor, But Momentum Says Otherwise — A Critical Standoff Unfolds “Zones 1 & 2: These were the ‘boredom phases’ where volatility died, and smart money accumulated,” he wrote. “Zone 2 specifically was the launchpad for the massive 2021 parabolic run. Zone 4 (Current Price Action): We are seeing the exact same rounding bottom formation.” That “rounding bottom” bit matters, because it’s not the dramatic reversal traders love to screenshot. It’s the opposite. It’s price stabilizing, forming a heavy base, refusing to break down — and doing it slowly enough that most people stop paying attention. Which, again, is kind of the point. Then there’s the RSI argument, and it’s the cleaner one. Cryptollica highlighted a weekly RSI floor around the low-30s area, suggesting DOGE has repeatedly found major cycle bottoms when momentum reset to that band. “Look at the RSI indicator at the bottom. The red line (~32 level) acts as a historical floor,” he wrote. “Every single time the weekly RSI touched or hovered near this baseline (Points 1, 2, and 3), it marked a macro bottom. Now: The RSI has reset back to this critical support level.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakdown Ahead? Analyst Flags 2022-Style Signal That’s the “sellers are exhausted” claim — not because a candle says so today, but because the longer-term momentum gauge has already done the full trip down to where DOGE previously stopped bleeding out and started building again. And he’s not being subtle about what comes next, at least in the cleanest version of the fractal. “This isn’t just random noise; it’s a cyclical reset,” Cryptollica wrote. “The chart suggests we are in the ‘Golden Pocket’ for accumulation. If the fractal plays out like it did in 2020 (Zone 2), the current price action is simply the calm before the storm.” To be clear, fractals aren’t guarantees. DOGE isn’t trading in a vacuum, and the macro/liquidity backdrop can absolutely mess with tidy historical comparisons. But if history repeats for DOGE, the best days could be ahead. At press time, Dogecoin traded at $0.13294. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin Reclaiming $0.128 Support Could Signal The Perfect Chance For Long Positions",
    "body": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading above a price level that could determine whether its recent decline turns into a base or extends into deeper weakness. A crypto analyst has identified a critical support level at $0.128, which could change Dogecoin’s bullish outlook if it continues to hold above it. According to the analysis, holding above this key level could create the ideal conditions for investors seeking long positions. Analyst Identifies $0.128 As Critical Support For Dogecoin The Dogecoin price is above a make-or-break zone that could define its next significant price move and signal how investors position themselves in the long term. Market expert Crypto Tony has shared an updated outlook on Dogecoin, focusing on the importance of reclaiming the key support zone around $0.128 before considering long positions. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Crashes To April Levels, Here’s What Happened Last Time Notably, Crypto Tony has stated that a long setup could become more favorable and appealing if DOGE’s price can hold steadily above the $0.128 level. The support zone also emerges as Dogecoin’s price action shows early signs of stabilization after a sustained downside pressure. For the past few months, the meme coin has been in a decline, mirroring the broader market downturn and sustained risk-off sentiment. The analyst’s chart shows Dogecoin recently selling off sharply before finding temporary stability slightly above $0.128 a few days ago. The meme coin’s price is also trading below the highlighted horizontal line on the chart, which aligns closely with the support area. Visual projections on the chart further suggest a period of sideways movement between $0.128 and $0.130, followed by a potential breakout to the upside. Crypto Tony pinpoints a bullish target near $0.135, representing a more than 2.2% surge from Dogecoin’s price of $.0132, as of writing. Dogecoin Weekly Chart Signals Extended Correction Before Price Explosion Pseudonymous crypto analyst Cantonese Cat has also delivered a weekly analysis of Dogecoin, highlighting a prolonged corrective phase in its market structure. According to him, DOGE has already endured roughly 13 months of bearish price action, which aligns with a potential Wave 2 correction. The analyst stated that this downturn stage would precede an explosive Wave 3, which could see the meme coin’s price jump to new highs. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Squeeze Maps Out Two Possible Scenarios From Here Cantonese Cat revealed in his analysis that his Dogecoin bullish setup may feel unlikely to many traders at the moment. This is especially true given that Dogecoin has been trending downwards for most of the year, failing to break out of its bearish position. Despite this, the analyst notes that the skepticism is precisely why the scenario remains plausible. The analyst’s chart shows that Dogecoin’s first wave has already completed, followed by a declining Wave 2. Price action is also interacting with multiple Fibonacci retracement levels while respecting a long-term downward trendline. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "The Gold-to-Bitcoin Rotation Narrative Gains Strength: A Data-Driven Review",
    "body": "Bitcoin is once again attempting to reclaim the $90,000 level, but price action remains capped below this key psychological threshold. Despite several short-lived relief rallies, momentum has failed to follow through, reinforcing growing concerns that the broader market structure is weakening. As volatility persists and upside attempts stall, an increasing number of analysts are beginning to openly discuss the possibility that Bitcoin may be transitioning into a bear market phase. Sentiment across derivatives and spot markets has turned noticeably more cautious, with risk appetite continuing to fade. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Lags Network Utility: A Valuation Reset Is Underway In this context, a recent report by Darkfost draws attention to a familiar but controversial narrative: capital rotation from gold into Bitcoin. With gold setting a new all-time high above $4,420 per ounce, the idea that investors may soon shift capital toward Bitcoin is resurfacing across the market. Historically, this narrative has gained traction during periods when traditional safe-haven assets outperform, fueling speculation that Bitcoin could follow as an alternative store of value. However, Darkfost cautions that this assumption is far from well-grounded. While the rotation thesis has been widely repeated throughout this cycle, empirical evidence linking gold outperformance directly to sustained Bitcoin inflows remains weak. Rather than signaling an imminent bullish turn, the current setup suggests that Bitcoin remains vulnerable, caught between macro-driven narratives and deteriorating internal market structure. Testing the Gold-to-Bitcoin Rotation Thesis Darkfost emphasizes that the popular narrative of capital rotating from gold into Bitcoin lacks direct, verifiable evidence. To address this, he constructed a comparative framework to identify periods where such rotations may have occurred. He did this without assuming a causal relationship. The core issue, as he notes, is that on-chain and market data cannot conclusively prove that capital exiting gold is the same capital entering Bitcoin. To approximate potential rotation phases, Darkfost applied a simple but disciplined signal structure. A positive signal appears when Bitcoin is trading above its 180-day moving average while gold is trading below its own 180-day moving average. In theory, this configuration suggests relative strength shifting toward Bitcoin. Conversely, a negative signal is triggered when both Bitcoin and gold trade below their respective 180-day moving averages. Indicating a broad risk-off environment rather than a rotation. This methodology allows historical comparison across cycles, highlighting moments where relative performance diverged. However, the results challenge the simplicity of the narrative. As shown on the chart, these signals do not produce consistent or reliable outcomes. In several instances, supposed rotation periods failed to generate sustained upside for Bitcoin. At other times, Bitcoin rallied independently of gold’s trend. The takeaway is clear: capital rotation between gold and Bitcoin is not an absolute or mechanical process. Market behavior appears far more nuanced. Driven by broader macro conditions, liquidity dynamics, and investor positioning rather than a straightforward asset-to-asset rotation. Related Reading: Ethereum Traders Chase Upside With Historic Leverage – Breakout Fuel Or Fragile Setup? Price Struggles Below Key Moving Averages Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize after a sharp corrective phase, but the chart highlights that price action remains structurally fragile. BTC is currently trading just below the $90,000 level, an area that has flipped from support into near-term resistance following the recent breakdown. While the latest bounce shows short-term buying interest, it has not yet altered the broader bearish structure that formed after the October highs. From a trend perspective, Bitcoin is now trading below the 50-3D moving average (blue), which has started to slope downward, signaling weakening momentum. The failure to reclaim this level suggests that recent upside moves are corrective rather than impulsive. Related Reading: Legendary Bitcoin OG Deepens Ethereum Bet Despite Losses Exceeding $70 Million Below the current price, the 100-3D moving average (green) sits near the $85,000–$86,000 zone and has acted as interim support during the rebound. A sustained loss of this area would likely expose BTC to a deeper retracement toward the 200-3D moving average (red), currently rising near the low $80,000 region. The sell-off was accompanied by elevated volume. While the rebound has occurred on comparatively lighter participation, pointing to a lack of conviction from buyers. Structurally, Bitcoin is consolidating in a lower range. With lower highs and compressed volatility suggesting a pause rather than a trend reversal. For bulls, reclaiming and holding above $90,000 and the declining 50-3D moving average is critical to invalidate the bearish bias. Until then, price action favors range-bound trading with downside risk still present. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Enters The Quiet Accumulation Phase For Institutional Players",
    "body": "As the broader crypto markets remain fixated on volatility and short-term narratives, XRP is quietly transitioning into the accumulation phase. Institutional players are increasingly positioning in silence, favoring strategic accumulation over public signaling. This phase is rarely loud or obvious, and it’s defined by patience, regulatory awareness, and long-term infrastructure planning rather than short-term speculation. While the broader crypto market debates short-term price swings, a quieter story is unfolding behind the scenes. According to skipper_xrp’s post on X, institutions and banks are methodically positioning themselves, and the word on the street is that they’re betting big on XRP. Why Institutions Accumulate XRP In Silence Many analysts believe that the asset is entering a phase where price discovery could accelerate beyond the $100 mark, and this sudden price increase will come as a shock to investors. At the same time, the XRP Ledger is expanding beyond its traditional role in cross-border payment into decentralized media in the US. Related Reading: ‘Think Again’ Before Selling Your XRP; Expert Tells Investors Adding to the momentum, BXE is set to list on a major US exchange on January 21st, following its partnership with a leading node provider. The increased network activity means higher usage of the XRP Ledger with more XRP being burned. Despite BXE trading at $0.06 and a fixed supply of 500 million, many investors view it as undervalued. An investor and crypto trader known as Xaif Crypto has mentioned that from 2019 to 2021, MoneyGram actively integrated Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, by leveraging XRP as the bridge asset for real-time foreign exchange settlement. However, when the US SEC filed its lawsuit against Ripple in late 2020, regulatory uncertainty forced MoneyGram to suspend the partnership despite XRP proving its effectiveness as a liquidity bridge. Currently, with Ripple largely moved past its regulatory overhang and gaining clearer legal standing, the industry is revisiting questions that were left unresolved: Will banks and payment institutions return to an XRP-based liquidity solution? Nonetheless, if institutions prioritize speed, capital efficiency, and regulatory clarity, history suggests that XRP already demonstrated all of the benefits and can work at scale before it was paused. The only variable missing at the time was regulatory certainty. How Institutional-Grade Yield Comes To XRP Holders Crypto trader Xaif Crypto has also revealed upcoming features for the XRP Ledger. According to Xaif, the XRPL lending protocol, a protocol-native framework that underwrites credit built directly into the Ledger, enabling fixed-term and fixed-rate loans, is on the horizon.
