    "title": "Bitcoin Path To $1 Million Clears With OG Sellers Fading: Dave Weisberger",
    "body": "Former chairman and co-founder of CoinRoutes and now president of BetterTrade.digital Dave Weisberger used a November 11 video to restate Bitcoin’s long-term bull case, arguing that the market’s “morose” sentiment and technician-driven calls for downside are missing the structural shift underway on both fundamentals and market microstructure. He framed his analysis in two parts—why Bitcoin is being bought and what the current market structure implies—contending that the thesis toward seven-figure pricing remains intact even without an obvious near-term catalyst. The Path To $1 Million Per Bitcoin On fundamentals, he drew a direct comparison with gold’s monetary role and size. Citing an above-ground market value of “around $28 trillion” and “about $7 trillion in known reserves below ground,” Weisberger argued that roughly 80% of gold’s value is monetary, not industrial, using the platinum–gold price relationship as a proxy. “Gold today trades at about two and a half times platinum, which for most of my life was about double the price of gold,” he said, adding that platinum is “30 times rarer and more valued by women in jewelry.” From that relative-value lens, he estimated gold’s “monetary value fully diluted around $28 trillion,” contrasting it with Bitcoin’s “fully diluted market cap just over $2 trillion at today’s prices.” Related Reading: China’s Cybersecurity Agency Alleges US Government Stole $13 Billion In Bitcoin If Bitcoin equals or surpasses gold on monetary characteristics, he argued, the gap implies transformative upside: “It could rise to equal gold. Except it’s better than gold on monetary characteristics.” He emphasized Bitcoin’s native digital finality, resistance to counterfeiting, divisibility, transparency, and programmatic supply schedule—benefits that also avoid gold’s custody, assay, and transport frictions. Even in a scenario where fiat “holds its value,” he suggested, network adoption alone could warrant a multi-fold repricing; in a debasement regime, he said, the asymmetry is stronger: “As the Bitcoin network grows and it gains acceptance it’ll likely rise by 10 times this or more.” Via X, he added “the Fundamental case” is $1 million in today’s dollars. Weisberger revisited the “fastest horse” framing popularized in the early COVID-era liquidity surge. He pointed to Paul Tudor Jones’s thesis in “May of 2020,” acknowledging he misspoke initially, and reminded viewers that the price then “did nothing” for months before a stepwise acceleration from October through the subsequent euphoric leg higher. The lesson, in his view, is that market tone can lag fundamentals until positioning resets and liquidity leadership rotates back to Bitcoin. “History doesn’t always repeat, but it can sometimes rhyme,” he said. On market structure, Weisberger took aim at the four-year halving cycle as a predictive template. Historically, he said, cyclical behavior followed a pattern—halving, a six-month period of miner-incentive doubt, then a relief-to-euphoria rally that later bled into altcoin rotation before a broad drawdown. He argued that dynamic is losing relevance because supply changes are now “irrelevant relative to the amount of demand that’s going on,” while network security trends tell a different story: “If you look at the Bitcoin hash rate chart, it’s increasing at a geometric pace.” The moving parts he sees actually driving prices are the interaction of legacy supply and institutional demand. “It’s basically the OG sellers who are selling over 100,000 [BTC] and the new buyers, whether they’re in ETFs or in MicroStrategy, etc.” Those early holders, in his telling, are rationally diversifying life-changing gains rather than capitulating, which implies a finite overhang: “Entrepreneurs don’t generally sell everything […] they sell some at a level to get where they need to be and then […] sell at later prices.” He underscored that spot ETF investors appear patient despite recent volatility. “Even after all of the carnage of the last few weeks since October 10th, less than 2% of the Bitcoin ETFs have outflown,” he said, characterizing that cohort as long-horizon allocators “looking for a 10x gain,” not trading around single-digit drawdowns. He contrasted October’s deleveraging—“$20 billion was liquidated […] but only five billion of the liquidation was in Bitcoin”—with the 2022 insolvency cascade: “This cycle doesn’t have a Celsius […] doesn’t have an FTX. The impact of the liquidations is not going to be to cause an insolvency event which causes forced sales.” Without a credit-driven unwind, he argued, technical analogies to 2022 are misplaced: “If there’s no forced sales, why do we expect a sale on the magnitude that happened in 2022 […]? They’re trying to impute something without taking into account the actual circumstance.” Related Reading: Most Reliable Bitcoin Boom Indicator Just Went Off-Script: Expert Price leadership, in his view, will return through “liquidity and slow grinding growth” while “hot money” recovers from leverage-driven losses. He expects the OG selling to “abate,” as partial profit-taking runs its course, setting the stage for the next euphoric leg once a catalyst emerges. Weisberger did not pretend to know which spark will ignite it—“I’m not a Nostradamus”—but listed plausible vectors that are consistent with prior cycles: “The catalyst could be sovereign accumulation. The catalyst could be Bitcoin being used as collateral […] It doesn’t really matter what the catalyst is.” The key risk for would-be sellers, he suggested, is time out of the market during the inflection: “Unless you are very nimble, very quick, have no tax consequences, and aren’t out of the market or on vacation in the two or three days when euphoria first starts, then I would be very, very reticent to sell here.” My 2 part Bitcoin analysis: 1) The Fundamental case for $1 Million Bitcoin in TODAYS dollar 2) Why the current gloom is unwarranted & now is a great time to accumulate Bitcoin for the long haul The Bull Case For Bitcoin 11 11 https://t.co/0ACKrn3bgQ via @YouTube — Dave W (@daveweisberger1) November 12, 2025 He closed with a caution that acknowledges the market’s capacity to frustrate both bulls and bears. “Maybe euphoria will happen after it continues to drag on and fall for another few months, but at some point it will happen,” he said. He disclosed his positioning—“I have not sold any sats, nor do I intend to”—and reiterated the discipline required in a choppy tape: “Stay safe out there. This market does look interesting and is going to likely stay that way for a while.” At press time, BTC traded at $104,954. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Crypto analyst Balo has assured that the Dogecoin price rally to a new all-time high (ATH) above $0.74 is in the works. He explained why this rally may be closer than some may imagine despite the recent bearish price action. Dogecoin Price Eyes Rally Above $0.74 ATH In an X post, crypto analyst Balo shared an accompanying chart showing that the Dogecoin price could surpass its current all-time high of $0.74, reaching $0.8 in the process. This came as the analyst opined that a major run was imminent for the foremost meme coin, despite its current downtrend. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Worst-Case Scenario For Dogecoin This Cycle Balo explained that at each local bottom since early 2024, there has always been a “messy” Dogecoin price action that looks designed to shake people out before the real jump. He added that DOGE has made higher lows and maintained the higher-timeframe (HTF) trend, and that the same price pattern appears to be repeating now. The crypto analyst also admitted that the parabolic surge for the Dogecoin price may feel far away, but that each mini cycle brings DOGE closer to its bull run. He also stated that this gives investors more time to accumulate before the DOGE price rallies to a new all-time high, which he claimed is just a matter of time. This bullish prediction for the Dogecoin price comes amid its current downtrend, with the meme coin struggling below the psychological $0.2 level. DOGE has continued to mirror Bitcoin’s price action, and with the flagship crypto threatening to drop below $100,000 again, crypto analyst Dogecoin OG predicts that the meme coin could fall to the $0.16 range. Analyst Predicts Mega Run For DOGE Crypto analyst Crypto Patel has also provided a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, declaring that the meme coin was ready for its next historic mega run. The analyst stated that the breakout and retest are complete and that the structure is locked and loaded for a parabolic explosion. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Set For 1,200% Rally To $2.2 In This 3rd Run Furthermore, Crypto Patel revealed that the same pattern that sent the Dogecoin price flying during the 2017 and 2021 bull cycles is repeating again on the monthly timeframe. He added that the move looks even more powerful this time around. As such, he expects DOGE to rally 10x to 33x based on the fractal confluence and macro breakout structure. Patel stated that targets 1 and 2 are $2 and $5, respectively, both of which mark new ATHs for the meme coin. His accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could reach these targets sometime next year. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.17, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "3 Top Trending Crypto to Watch as Tether Records Big Profits",
    "body": "What to Know: Tether’s new commodities desk and expanding gold reserves show crypto’s largest stablecoin is morphing into a broader financial platform. Tether’s recent Q3 report showcases profits north of $10B and a balance sheet of over $181B. For traders seeking trending crypto, infra plus utility shines: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), Best Wallet Token ($BEST), and Polkadot ($DOT) align with this shift. $DOT offers cross-chain optionality near multi-year value zones as flows broaden beyond ETH/SOL; watch ecosystem execution. Tether just signaled it’s not content being ‘only’ a stablecoin giant. In a headline-grabbing move, the company poached HSBC’s top precious-metals executives to build a commodities desk, an unmistakable push into the bullion trade. Vincent Domien and Mathew O’Neill, senior metals leaders at HSBC, are set to spearhead the new unit, according to a Bloomberg article . That’s the crypto world stepping directly onto TradFi’s most guarded turf. Why now? The firm’s latest attestation shows year-to-date profits above $10B , excess reserves of $6.8B, and double-digit billions in gold and bitcoin on the books—financial firepower that turns experiments into strategy. With a balance sheet of over $181B, liquidity ripples across crypto. For now, momentum is pointing sideways, but historically, fresh institutional rails have opened new speculative lanes. That’s why capital is hunting narratives with clear catalysts—the kind that could benefit Bitcoin scaling plays, utility tokens tied to wallets, and high-beta layer-zero ecosystems. With that as a context, here are three crypto to watch as this story unfolds. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin Rollup Narrative With SVM Firepower If Tether is normalizing real-world collateral on-chain, the next crowd-pleaser is throughput: cheap, fast execution secured by Bitcoin. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) pitches exactly that, an SVM-powered rollup aligned to $BTC settlement, aiming to make Bitcoin app-usable without impacting its security. The project’s documents and public dev notes emphasize native Solana-program compatibility, sequencing research, and a rollup-first security model, pragmatic signals for builders who want speed but won’t compromise finality. For traders watching risk rotations, a ‘Bitcoin L2 with Solana-grade performance’ is a potent narrative, while tools like the Canonical Bridge create powerful utility by dropping confirmation times from hours to seconds and reducing transaction costs significantly. The presale numbers back up the interest: over $26.9M raised so far, with a token price of $0.013255 and virtually unlimited potential. This alone makes $HYPER one of the best crypto to watch today. Based on Hyper’s value proposition, meme context, and impact on Bitcoin’s ecosystem, our price prediction for $HYPER proposes a price point of $0.08625 by the end of 2026. An easy 550% ROI if you invest at today’s price. If this sounds like profit, read our guide on how to buy $HYPER before doing anything else. Then head to the official presale page to secure your $HYPER allocation today. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Utility Token for an Active Web3 Wallet Wallet tokens trend when retail flows return. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) leverages this approach with tangible in-app perks, including reduced swap fees, early access to curated presales, boosted staking tiers, and card rewards, thereby tying token ownership to ongoing wallet usage. The token supports the Best Wallet ecosystem, which offers top security, non-custodial services, and access to a variety of present and upcoming features. These include the Best Card and the Best Dex, with access to over 50 chains. For traders, the angle is simple: if Tether’s push accelerates tokenized-asset adoption, the next wave of users needs a wallet that lowers frictions and funnels opportunities. $BEST attempts to monetize that funnel. The presale raised over $16.9M so far, with $BEST valued at $0.025935. Based on the token’s utility and Best Wallet’s value proposition, our price prediction for $BEST puts it at $0.05106175 by the end of 2026. As an early investor, you’re looking at a 96% ROI over the course of 12 months. You can read our guide on how to buy $BEST to learn more about the purchasing process. Go to the presale page and buy your $BEST today. 3. Polkadot ($DOT) — Cross-Chain Upgrades at ‘Value’ Altcoin Levels Not every rotation needs seed-stage risk. At roughly $3 and a $5B-class market cap, Polkadot ($DOT) screens as ‘value beta’ among layer-0s, with a multi-year push to simplify parachain economics and improve bridging safety. Real-time dashboards put $DOT at $3.11 and market cap just over $5B, with mainstream investor outlets flagging similar levels. If tokenized real-world assets ramp, cross-chain messaging and sovereign app-chains re-enter the conversation—and $DOT’s architecture was built for that. For developers, the play is specialized chains with common security; for traders, it’s the optionality that comes with volumes broadening beyond Ethereum and Solana. Key catalysts to watch include enhancements to core messaging, scheduling of next-generation parachain auctions, and any progress from $DOT-based RWA pilots. Price-wise, $DOT doesn’t need mania to re-rate; it needs credible throughput demand across its ecosystem—something that tends to firm up when liquidity is allocated to new venues. If Tether’s metals desk deepens on-chain settlement for RWAs, a neutral routing layer like Polkadot starts to look mispriced relative to its optionality. If you want to invest, go to your favorite exchange and buy your $DOT today. Recap: Tether’s raid on HSBC’s bullion bench isn’t a stunt—it’s a signal that tokenized commodities are entering prime time. In that environment, infrastructure and utility stand to benefit. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to be the BTC-secured rollup where apps actually run; Best Wallet Token ($BEST) anchors wallet-level utility and user acquisition; Polkadot ($DOT) offers cross-chain plumbing at a ‘value’ multiple. This is not financial advice. Do your own research before investing. Authored by Aaron Walker, NewsBTC: https://www.newsbtc.com/news/tether-trending-crypto-bitcoin-hyper-best-wallet-polkadot",

    "title": "Canary Capital’s $XRP ETF Is Imminent. $SUBBD Could Be Next In Line",
    "body": "What to Know: An $XRP spot ETF listing widens regulated access to altcoins, which usually tightens spreads and deepens liquidity across adjacent sectors. Canary’s 8-A form points to a Thursday debut; $XRP already saw a price pop and volume surge into the launch window. SUBBD introduces on-chain subscriptions, token-gated content, and AI assistants that turn creator-fan interactions into repeatable transactions. The presale sits at over $1.33M, with $SUBBD valued at $0.056925 and staking at a fixed 20%. Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF has cleared the last major hurdle and is now teed up to begin trading on the Nasdaq as early as Thursday, with listing references pointing to the ticker ‘XRPC.’ $XRP reacted on cue, notching an intraday jump of up to 10% while 24-hour trading volumes swelled by roughly 40%, sending spot prices near $2.43. The timing isn’t random. In September, US exchanges won the ability to use generic listing standards for spot crypto ETFs, compressing timelines that used to drag on for months. That rule change opened the door for non-$BTC assets to follow, and the first wave has already shown how fast the playbook can run once the plumbing is in place. 💡 If $XRP joins $ETH and $SOL in the ETF club, altcoin liquidity broadens, spreads tighten, and flows begin migrating from pure crypto rails to brokerage accounts. That’s real market structure change, not just another narrative. And for $XRP, that’s payments and creator-facing commerce where fast settlement and low fees matter. This is where one of the season’s better-positioned presales, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD), is pitching utility instead of vibes: an AI-powered creator subscription stack with on-chain payments, content gating, and baked-in rewards. $XRP ETF Opens The Floodgates For Altcoin Liquidity A confirmed listing path for an $XRP spot product means passive money can finally ‘buy the basket’ of large-cap alts without dealing with self-custody. Canary’s trust moved forward after a Form 8-A filing – typically the final procedural check before trading – while market monitors flag a Thursday go-live window. That backdrop should play well for projects tied to real spend. 💡 SUBBD’s design is straightforward: creators sell subscriptions, fans unlock content and features, and $SUBBD settles the exchange while powering perks like discounts, XP multipliers, and early feature access. The team frames it as an AI-driven layer for the already-massive subscription content market. This includes native token incentives that reduce platform take rates and keep more earnings with the people actually making the content. If ETF flows are the macro tide, platforms that turn that liquidity into daily transactions are the shoreline. The SUBBD ecosystem is one of them. SUBBD Turns Creator Subscriptions Into On-Chain Utility On the product side, SUBBD ($SUBBD) ships the elements most creator platforms still duct-tape: payments, token-gated content, and AI assistants to handle requests, chat, and simple management chores. Holders pay less for subscriptions, stake to amplify XP and rewards, and gain access to exclusive drops and beta features. 🔄 For top creators, staking also unlocks VIP perks and collaboration opportunities. It’s a clean loop: pay, participate, earn, repeat – all recorded on-chain for better transparency. The $SUBBD whitepaper lays out an ecosystem where the $SUBBD token is the medium of exchange and the incentive rail, with staking and gamification stitched directly into the product rather than bolted on. Tokenomics mirror that utility focus. Allocations reserve a dedicated pool for staking rewards and liquidity, with the rest split across development, marketing, airdrops, and community incentives. Staking is live at a fixed 20% rate during presale, with a short cooldown after claiming. It’s the kind of predictable reward that helps creators and fans set expectations while the platform ramps. If you want a token built around actual usage – paid subscriptions and content access – this is the pitch, so get your $SUBBD today Presale Math And The Near-Term Upside The presale has raised $1.33M+, with a current token price of $0.056925 and staking rewards locked at 20% APY. 💰 $SUBBD’s potential is massive, though. Our price prediction for $SUBBD sees a possiblw 2026 high of around $0.668, which – if reached – implies roughly 11.6x gains from the current presale mark. That’s an ROI of 1,073%. The estimates lean on standard drivers: user growth, exchange access, and delivery of the AI tooling that turns creators into full-stack micro-businesses. None of that is guaranteed, but the path is more practical than many presales. The $XRP ETF matters here because liquidity attention tends to cascade. Payments-adjacent and creator-commerce projects sit close to XRP’s core utility narrative, so they often see spillover when fresh ETF demand hits the tape. If $XRP volumes lift and spreads compress, user-facing apps with low-friction payments usually benefit next. $SUBBD is positioning for that moment with a working economic loop and clear rewards. The first steps have already been taken, as the project has already onboarded the 2K+ of the top content creators, bringing a combined following of 250M+. So, read our guide on how to buy $SUBBD and head to the official presale website for more information. 🚀 The conclusion is simple: buy $SUBBD today before the train leaves the station.

    "title": "Bitcoin Supply-Loss Chart Flashes Possible Bottom Signal — Is Reversal Emerging?",
    "body": "The cryptocurrency market has weathered a challenging period, testing the resolve of the most seasoned investors. After a prolonged period of downward pressure, the Bitcoin Supply-Loss Chart is flashing a possible bottom signal. A Deeper Look At Bitcoin Supply In Loss Chart Bitcoin on-chain data on the loss chart is currently flashing a possible bottom. In an X post, CryptosRus has revealed that the supply in the Loss metric chart tracks the total amount of BTC held by addresses where the current market price is below the average cost basis of those holdings. Essentially, the portion of BTC owners is currently underwater on their investment. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Bottom Out In 300 Days: Top Expert Forecasts $38,000 To $50,000 Price Point As a sentiment indicator, the high levels of supply in the Loss chart typically signal fear, capitulation selling, and potential market bottoms. In addition, the low levels indicate broad profitability and market greed. On April 7, 2025, when BTC traded around $74,508, the supply in loss was 5.159 million BTC. By November 5, 2025, even with BTC rising to $98,966, the supply in loss had also increased to 5.639 million BTC. During mid-2024, a similar situation reportedly occurred, marking the bottom at that time. The expert also outlined particular areas on the chart marked as 3, 4, and 5, which show uncanny similarities. Furthermore, in October 2025, recent lows showed a sharp spike in losses amid volatility, with approximately 30% of supply going underwater. On the chart, the yellow boxes highlight a rapid build-up, which has been a potent precursor to the market bottom. Currently, the supply in the loss has climbed to 28% and 33%, which is equivalent to 5.5 million BTC to 6.5 million BTC, matching the October endpoint on the chart and echoing the correction patterns seen in 2024. CryptosRus concluded that this may bring short-term bearish pressure, but it could flush out the final weak holders, opening the way for a bounce in Q4 and Q1 2026. The Accumulation Phase Before The Breakout Bitcoin has experienced three major corrections in this cycle, and each one has eventually led to a new all-time high after months of conviction. According to an analyst known as 0xBossman, this correction is no different, and each of these corrections has been brutal in its own way. BTC’s market flushed out the leveraged traders, resulting in them losing it all. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market Peak Indicators Says Hold Despite Crash Below $100,000, What’s Happening? Meanwhile, the boredom that comes as a result of these corrections is what has led to the bearish sentiment. The market feels indecisive, and altcoins have bled. Thus, 0xBossman advised that traders should step back and realize that this consolidation will end with a massive green candle. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Loans Usher In a New BTC Era – Bitcoin Hyper Tipped as the Next 1000x Crypto",
    "body": "What to Know: Bitcoin loans mark a shift from passive holding to active $BTC deployment, broadening access and reinforcing Bitcoin’s monetary role. Active $BTC lending can tighten liquidity loops: more collateralization, deeper markets, and stronger institutional incentives to hold $BTC. Bitcoin Hyper aims to make $BTC fast and programmable via an SVM-based Layer 2 with ZK settlement to Bitcoin. $HYPER’s strong presale momentum and large whale purchases fit perfectly into the current $BTC-focused cycle – one that’s fueled by real utility rather than pure hype. A Canadian Bitcoin-native company just issued its first Bitcoin-backed loan. That’s not a small tweak to the status quo. It’s a signal that $BTC is edging from ‘digital gold’ into an active financial asset, one that non-crypto users can finally access through a familiar product: lending. The firm’s goal is simple: accumulate $BTC and deploy it productively, yet the implication is big. More ways to borrow and build with Bitcoin usually mean stronger demand, deeper liquidity, and a broader user funnel. This design shift matters because utility beats narrative over a full cycle. Loans let institutions put idle $BTC to work and give businesses a way to leverage $BTC without selling it. The feedback loop is obvious: lending platforms attract borrowers, borrowers source $BTC, hodlers see new yield paths, and liquidity improves for everyone. Every service that treats $BTC as collateral, rather than a speculative asset, boosts its monetary credibility. That sets a timely backdrop for Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a $BTC-centric Layer 2 project built to make Bitcoin fast, programmable, and dApp-ready, and one many investors are already eyeing as the next 1000x crypto . If Bitcoin is stepping into mainstream finance, a chain that bridges $BTC into high-throughput smart contracts sits right in the slipstream. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Turns $BTC Into A High-Speed, Programmable Asset Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) proposes a Bitcoin Layer-2 that uses an SVM-based execution environment, canonical bridging, and ZK proofs to move $BTC at near-instant speed with low fees. The aim is to retain Bitcoin-grade security while unlocking staking, DeFi, and on-chain apps for $BTC itself. This approach directly addresses a pain point that lending alone can’t solve: throughput and programmability on Bitcoin. If loans expand demand for $BTC as collateral, a performant L2 expands what that collateral can actually do. The flow is straightforward. Users bridge $BTC, transact on Layer 2 with high throughput, then periodically settle back to Bitcoin L1 with cryptographic proofs. In practice, that means cheaper payments, faster markets, and room for dApps that rely on programmability without compromising the trust people expect from Bitcoin. The more services reference $BTC, like the newly launched loans, the more a generalized execution layer becomes useful for builders who prefer to stay within the Bitcoin ecosystem rather than porting value elsewhere. Utility also needs clear developer pathways. The $HYPER whitepaper emphasizes developer experience, observability, and infrastructure, enabling teams to ship quickly. If the project can make building on $BTC feel familiar to teams used to modern VM stacks, it lowers switching costs and accelerates innovation. That’s the kind of narrative institutions understand: faster rails, safer settlement, and broader use cases. Get on the $HYPER train before it’s too late. Presale Momentum Meets A $BTC Lending Tailwind Momentum is real. The Bitcoin Hyper presale has reached $26.9M, and you can buy $HYPER right now for just $0.013265. That’s a solid show of demand for a $BTC-first L2 at a time when Bitcoin’s financialization is visibly accelerating. If lending adoption widens the $BTC gateway, $BTC-native infrastructure stands to benefit directly. On-chain activity adds another datapoint. A recent transaction sent about 63.8 ETH, roughly $226K, into the presale contract, resulting in a transfer of 16.8M HYPER. While one whale doesn’t define a market, large buyers usually do their homework and often act as early liquidity. That fits the pattern of growing presale participation and the broader rotation toward $BTC-aligned narratives. What does the $HYPER price prediction look like in simple terms? Using the current price as a base, a year-end 2025 target of $0.02595 implies roughly 1.96x from here if the team delivers core milestones and listings. A 2026 scenario at $0.08625 would be about 6.51x if the DAO and incentive programs mature as planned. As Bitcoin-backed lending marks a new phase in $BTC’s financial integration, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the infrastructure built to support that momentum. With its Layer 2 approach and growing presale, $HYPER could play a key role in turning the latest Bitcoin lending headlines into lasting on-chain utility.

    "title": "Institutions Have Been Buying Solana Every Day For 2 Weeks, Is $300 Possible?",
    "body": "Institutional capital is circling back to Solana (SOL) as Spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) open the gates to a new wave of inflows. Solana’s resurgence has caught the attention of the broader crypto community, recording consistent daily inflows and experiencing momentum it has not seen in months. The question now remains whether this steady buildup of institutional accumulation could eventually propel SOL’s price toward the $300 mark. Solana Records 11 Days Of Consecutive ETF Inflows The Solana price is currently hovering above $156, roughly half of its ATH of just over $294 set in January 2025. Over the past few months, the altcoin has experienced significant volatility, including a 20% decline in the last month. During this period, there was little news to drive the market. However, the recent surge in SOL ETF activity could signal a potential turnaround for Solana’s price. Related Reading: Institutional Investors Are Buying XRP And Solana At An Accelerated Rate While They Dump Bitcoin According to data from SoSoValue, US Spot Solana ETFs have witnessed a cumulative total net inflow of $350.47 million in less than two weeks. This suggests that institutions have been buying Solana ETFs every single day since its launch, signaling confidence in the current volatile market. Today, the daily total net inflow of Solana ETFs reached $7.98 million, approximately $1.2 million higher than the previous day’s $6.78 million. SoSoValue’s chart shows that the highest daily inflow during the past 11 days occurred on November 3, when Solana ETFs drew an impressive $70.05 million from both Bitwise and Grayscale. Bitwise’s BSOL ETF has been the primary driver of this steady inflow, accounting for $331.74 million of the total, while Grayscale’s GSOL ETF contributed a modest $18.72 million. The data underscores that institutions are not only showing interest in these new crypto investment products but are actively establishing long-term positions in Solana exposure. Considering Bitcoin ETFs drive the cryptocurrency’s price to former ATHs in 2024, Solana could see a similar response if ETF inflows remain strong and the broader market sentiment stays positive. While it remains unclear whether the cryptocurrency can reach $300, the steady accumulation from institutions provides a constructive foundation for future price appreciation. Grayscale Expands Trading Access With Solana ETF New reports reveal that Grayscale has added another layer of optimism to the SOL news by announcing that options trading for its Solana Trust ETF is not yet live. This provides investors with additional opportunities to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency, manage risk, and trade around Solana’s price movements. Related Reading: Solana To Dethrone Bitcoin And Ethereum? Here’s How The First SOL ETFs Are Faring Grayscale has announced that the Solana Trust will offer 100% staking, zero fees, and an average staking rewards rate exceeding 7%, making it an attractive option for investors seeking both exposure and yield. As Grayscale’s new moves strengthen Solana’s presence in the digital asset landscape, the introduction of options trading could also improve liquidity for the cryptocurrency.

    "title": "Ripple Exec Reveals Why The Bitcoin Price Is So High Now",
    "body": "Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, has provided a clear explanation for why the Bitcoin price remains so high, currently the most expensive cryptocurrency on the market. Notably, Schwartz’s statement had sparked new discussions across the crypto community. His remarks focused on how people view and use BTC in transactions, revealing a simple economic truth that helps explain the market’s continued confidence in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Ripple CTO Explains Logic Behind Elevated Bitcoin Price On Tuesday, Schwartz shared his thoughts on X, offering a simple but insightful explanation for Bitcoin’s current price strength. Responding to a community member’s question about why anyone would spend BTC given its potential for future appreciation, Schwartz explained that the reason lies in the asset’s perceived value and future expectations. Related Reading: Why Did The Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Crash On October 10 And Will It Happen Again? According to the Ripple CTO, when individuals use Bitcoin to pay for goods or services, they are essentially realizing the full expected value of its future growth today. Rather than holding Bitcoin as a long-term investment and waiting for price gains, these users convert its potential into immediate utility. This behavior, he noted, reflects a broader belief in BTC’s enduring value and is one of the primary reasons why the cryptocurrency’s price remains so high. Notably, Schwartz’s remarks followed a conversation that began when Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Square, a business technology company, announced that Bitcoin payments had gone live across the firm’s platforms. Dorsey revealed that Square customers can now pay for services and products using Bitcoin directly, and sellers can choose between multiple settlement options, including BTC-to-BTC, BTC-to-fiat, and fiat-to-BTC transactions. Funds received through Bitcoin payments will be automatically stored in a user’s Square wallet, with self-custody transfer limits of up to $15,000 per day or $50,000 per week. Interestingly, the timing of Schwartz’s explanation comes a month after BTC reached a new all-time high of over $126,000. Compared to other digital assets, Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency in the six-figure territory, even surpassing traditional investments like gold and major stock indices. While some analysts argue that Bitcoin is overvalued, many investors remain convinced that it could still climb significantly higher in the long term. Bitcoin Price Expected To Rise Even Higher The Bitcoin price is currently sitting above the $100,000 level, but analysts believe it could rise even further. The leading cryptocurrency is hovering near $103,300, experiencing some volatility, which has triggered a nearly 2% dip in the past 24 hours amid whale capitulations. Crypto analyst Joe Francesco noted that Bitcoin had initially surged to $107,000 following a wave of optimism sparked by US President Donald Trump’s proposed $2,000 stimulus plan. Related Reading: New XRP ETF Just Dropped, But Will Anything Be Different This Time? However, the rally proved short-lived, as BTC fell a few days later. Despite the pullback, Francesco has described the cryptocurrency’s chart setup as positive, predicting that Bitcoin could soon break through $107,000, with the potential to reach $115,000 and even $120,000 if upward momentum continues.

    "body": "XRP is entering one of its most crucial weeks in months as a series of bullish catalysts align to set the stage for what could be a breakout move. The token has held firmly above the $2.20 support zone despite the recent market crash, and both technical and fundamental factors now point toward a possible surge in price. According to crypto analyst Guy on the Earth, XRP is in a make-or-break moment, with abundant news catalysts giving traders reasons to stay optimistic about the short-term direction. XRP Holds $2.20 Support; Analyst Eyes Resistance Ahead “Another reversal from lows as XRP holds onto the $2.20 support,” said Guy on the Earth in a recent post on X, capturing the cautious positiveness in the price of XRP. He noted that the token is currently slap bang mid-range, targeting a retest of the $2.63 to $2.72 resistance zone. Related Reading: The XRP Price Is About To Do This In November – “Get Ready” According to him, there is an abundance of positive catalysts this week, ranging from ETF speculation to the end of the ongoing government shutdown. These catalysts are very important, as XRP needs a continuation of its momentum bounce from $2.2 to target the next resistance from here; otherwise, this is a dead cat at best. The analyst emphasized that XRP’s ability to defend its key support levels will be critical in shaping its near-term trajectory. He warned that if the token revisits the $2.20 range, it may struggle to hold that level again, potentially slipping to between $1.90 and $2.00. Despite this caution, he maintained his conviction that the recent lows are already in and that XRP is gradually preparing for a range breakout to the upside. “Things are coming together for the rally we’ve been looking for,” he added, while noting that chopping around this zone is healthy before a break of the range higher. ETF Anticipation Builds Momentum For XRP A large part of this week’s optimism surrounding XRP is tied to growing speculation that a US-listed exchange-traded fund could be nearing approval. Canary Capital’s recent Form 8-A submission to the US Securities and Exchange Commission has increased expectations that the long-discussed spot XRP ETF might debut soon, possibly under the ticker “XRPC.” Related Reading: XRP Price Performance In November: History Says It’s The Most Bullish Month In History The anticipation surrounding this ETF has already begun shaping market sentiment, reflected in the steady stream of excitement from XRP supporters across social media. Traders are drawing comparisons to the rallies seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum following their respective ETF approvals, anticipating a similar influx of institutional demand if XRP’s turn arrives. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.41, a 2% dip in the past 24 hours. Maintaining the $2.20 support remains the key technical objective for bulls, as holding that level could pave the way for another attempt at the $2.72 resistance zone in the next few days.

    "title": "Bitcoin’s Historical Liquidity Indicator Just Lit Up — Big Move Incoming?",
    "body": "According to an analyst, Bitcoin sits in a liquidity set-up that has shown up before big rallies. Prices are not shooting higher yet. At press time Bitcoin trades around $104,500, down 0.5% over the past day. Related Reading: XRP’s Next ‘Face-Melting’ Rally Could Hit Within 6 Weeks—Analyst Traders watched a decline of about 1.8% earlier that pushed the price near $103,400 and it briefly touched $102,850 during the move. Stablecoin Signal Points Toward Accumulation CryptoQuant analyst Moreno points to the Stablecoin Supply Ratio, or SSR, as the first clear indicator. The SSR compares Bitcoin’s market cap to the total market cap of stablecoins. It has dropped back into the 13 range. Based on historical readings, that 13 area has lined up with market lows in mid-2021 and at several moments across 2024. Reports show that when SSR fell to similar levels, liquidity quietly built up and buying followed after a period of low volatility. Liquidity Pattern Has Appeared Before Every Bitcoin Surge — And It’s Back “We’re witnessing a liquidity configuration that has only appeared a handful of times since 2020, and each instance marked a pivotal moment for Bitcoin’s trajectory.” – By @MorenoDV_ pic.twitter.com/vWKcCkyn55 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 11, 2025 Binance Reserve Trends Add A Second Layer The second metric Moreno highlights comes from Binance. On that exchange, stablecoin balances are rising while Bitcoin reserves are shrinking. In plain terms: more cash-like tokens sit on the exchange and fewer coins are being held there. That pattern has appeared only a handful of times since 2020, according to the data he referenced. Each time, the movement suggested capital waiting on the sidelines and holders moving coins off exchanges into longer-term storage. Market Calm Can Hide Big Moves The current trading backdrop is cautious. Many investors expected a lift after news that the US Congress approved short-term federal funding through January 30, yet crypto did not rally with other risk assets. Some capital rotated back to stocks. At the same time, large holders took profits after recent highs, and momentum cooled. That mix shows how macro events can shift flows without immediately turning into crypto buying. Risk Still Exists — Structure Could Break Moreno warns this liquidity zone acts like a final structural support. If the metrics break down decisively, it could signal a deeper reset before any sustained recovery. In that scenario, buying would likely be delayed and volatility would rise. This is not a guaranteed outcome, but it is a clear risk that traders watch closely. Outlook: Limited Downside, Growing Upside Based on reports and on-chain signals, Moreno believes the risk-to-reward favors buyers at these levels. He points to the built-up stablecoin supply and falling exchange BTC reserves as reasons for that view. Related Reading: Could Shiba Inu Triple? Analyst Sees 200% Move Coming Historical patterns suggest the last three months of the year often bring gains for Bitcoin, but past behavior does not promise future returns. For now, the indicators show capital parked in stablecoins and fewer coins available on major exchanges. That creates a setup where fresh buying could push the market higher quickly if sentiment turns. Yet the opposite is possible: a break below these levels would reshape the cycle and force many participants to rethink positions. Markets will decide which path comes next.

    "body": "Uniswap (UNI) has sparked a storm across DeFi after founder Hayden Adams unveiled the long-awaited “UNIfication” proposal, a sweeping governance overhaul that introduces protocol fees, a substantial $842 million token burn, and a strategic buyback plan. Related Reading: XRP’s Next ‘Face-Melting’ Rally Could Hit Within 6 Weeks—Analyst The move marks Uniswap’s biggest reform since its 2020 token launch, designed to transform UNI from a passive governance token into a deflationary, yield-generating asset. Under the proposal, 0.3% of all trading volume will now be split between liquidity providers (0.25%) and a UNI buyback pool (0.05%), creating continuous demand for the token. With over $1 trillion in annualized trading volume, analysts project roughly $38 million in monthly buybacks, about $450 million annually. Whales Accumulate as Uniswap (UNI) Skyrockets 63% The market reaction was explosive. Uniswap (UNI) surged by over 63% in one week, peaking at $10 before stabilizing around $8.57. On-chain data from Santiment shows rising whale accumulation and a steady increase in UNI held outside of exchanges, indicating long-term investor confidence. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes reportedly purchased $244,000 worth of UNI, joining institutional buyers positioning for a supply shock. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju predicted that if protocol fees remain active, annual burns could exceed $500 million, drastically tightening supply. “Even with unlocks, a UNI supply shock seems inevitable,” Ju noted. The rally also extended to other DeFi assets, such as AAVE, Synthetix, and Compound, as traders speculated that Uniswap’s model could set a new standard for protocol-owned liquidity and value distribution. UNI's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: UNIUSD on Tradingview UNIfication Ushers in the Next Era of DeFi Governance Beyond tokenomics, UNIfication unites Uniswap Labs, the Foundation, and the Unichain L2 network under one ecosystem. The proposal eliminates interface fees, introduces fee discount auctions to enhance LP returns, and compensates governance delegates, turning Uniswap’s decision-making into a professionalized, revenue-sharing system. Adams emphasized that the initiative represents more than a technical upgrade, it’s a cultural shift. “Uniswap can be the primary place tokens are traded globally,” he said. “This proposal ends a restrictive chapter and begins the decade of Uniswap.” Related Reading: Ethereum Ready To Explode To $12,000 By January, Says Tom Lee With UNI up more than 66% this week and investors anticipating formal governance approval, the DeFi giant appears poised to reclaim its dominance as crypto’s flagship decentralized exchange.

    "title": "Ethereum Whale Adds $105M To His ETH Position – $1.33B Bought Since Nov 4",
    "body": "Ethereum has entered a consolidation phase following a turbulent period of selling pressure driven by macroeconomic uncertainty and market fear surrounding the US government shutdown. Over the past week, Ethereum’s price has stabilized around the $3,500 level after briefly dipping below key supports, as traders and institutions reassess risk exposure across the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH-MVRV Rebounds From Local Low – Potential Recovery Toward $115K–$120K Despite the cautious sentiment, on-chain data reveals a contrasting story — large holders, or “whales,” are quietly accumulating ETH during the downturn. According to data from Lookonchain and CryptoQuant, several high-value wallets have increased their Ethereum positions significantly, signaling growing confidence among long-term investors even as broader market momentum slows. This accumulation phase suggests that sophisticated players view current price levels as an opportunity rather than a sign of broader weakness. Historically, similar patterns of whale buying during macro uncertainty have preceded periods of recovery and renewed market strength. Whale Activity Suggests Strategic Accumulation Despite Market Uncertainty According to data from Lookonchain, a whale known for aggressive Ethereum accumulation has just purchased an additional 30,548 ETH ($105.36 million) within the past hour. This move brings his total acquisitions since November 4 to an astonishing 385,718 ETH, worth roughly $1.33 billion. Notably, around $270 million of the funds used for these purchases were borrowed from the decentralized lending platform Aave, highlighting a highly leveraged but strategic positioning. This type of activity often signals strong institutional confidence in Ethereum’s medium-term outlook. Borrowing large sums to accumulate ETH indicates that the whale expects price appreciation substantial enough to offset borrowing costs and volatility risks. It also reflects growing demand for Ethereum exposure within decentralized finance (DeFi), where whales utilize platforms like Aave to optimize capital efficiency. Such large-scale buying can have multiple implications: it absorbs available market liquidity, strengthens psychological support zones, and may trigger a sentiment shift among retail investors who interpret the move as bullish. However, it also introduces potential short-term risk — if prices correct further, leveraged positions could amplify volatility. Overall, the data points toward renewed accumulation momentum, suggesting that sophisticated market participants are positioning for Ethereum’s next major move. Related Reading: Uniswap Founder Submits Governance Proposal To Burn UNI — Token Jumps 50% Bulls Attempt to Reclaim Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is currently showing signs of stabilization after weeks of intense selling pressure, trading around $3,479 at the time of writing. The daily chart shows ETH holding just above the 200-day moving average (red line) — a key long-term support level that has historically acted as a launch point for bullish recoveries. After dipping below $3,200 earlier in the week, Ethereum bounced strongly, supported by renewed whale accumulation and improving market sentiment. However, the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages remain above the current price, indicating that the short-term trend is still tilted to the downside. For bulls to regain control, ETH needs to close decisively above $3,650–$3,700, where a confluence of resistance sits.

If Ethereum fails to maintain the $3,400–$3,450 zone, the next major support lies near $3,200. On the upside, reclaiming the $3,700 mark could open the door to a recovery toward $4,000. Overall, Ethereum appears to be in a consolidation phase, with large holders accumulating while retail traders remain cautious — a structure that often precedes a stronger directional move.

    "body": "Ethereum price failed to stay above $3,550. ETH is trimming gains and might decline further if it dips below the $3,350 support. Ethereum started a fresh decline after it failed to stay above $3,550. The price is trading below $3,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,550 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below the $3,350 zone. Ethereum Price Dips Further Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $3,650 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH price dipped below $3,550 and entered a short-term bearish zone. The decline gathered pace below $3,500 and the price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,176 swing low to the $3,658 high. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . If there is another recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $3,475 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,500 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,550 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,550 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A clear move above the $3,550 resistance might send the price toward the $3,650 resistance. An upside break above the $3,650 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,800 resistance zone or even $3,880 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,500 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,400 level. The first major support sits near the $3,360 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,176 swing low to the $3,658 high. A clear move below the $3,360 support might push the price toward the $3,280 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,240 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,220 and $3,200. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone. Major Support Level – $3,360 Major Resistance Level – $3,550",

    "title": "Dogecoin Alert! Price Could Explode Over 2,800%, Analyst Says",
    "body": "According to market reports, crypto analyst Crypto Patel has put forward bold targets for Dogecoin, saying the memecoin could reach $2 and $5 this cycle. Related Reading: XRP Has Held Its Ground As Most Altcoins Fall, Market Observers Say At the time of his post, DOGE was trading around $0.17, making those estimates equal to roughly 1,076% and over 2,800% gains from that level. The call has drawn attention because it ties price hopes to repeating chart behavior rather than fresh fundamentals. Chart Patterns And Historical Runs According to the analyst’s charts, DOGE has formed a long-running descending triangle since its $0.75 peak in 2021. Traders are being shown a breakout followed by a retest pattern. Reports point to similar setups in past rallies: in 2017 DOGE moved from about $0.00022 to $0.019 — roughly 9,800% — and in 2021 it climbed from about $0.0025 to $0.75, a surge of over 32,000%. Those runs are the basis for the “fractal confluence” argument that history could repeat. DOGECOIN READY FOR ITS NEXT HISTORIC MEGA RUN 🚀 Breakout ✅ Retest ✅ Structure locked and loaded for a parabolic explosion! The same pattern that sent $DOGE flying in 2017, 2021 is repeating again on the monthly timeframe and this time, the move looks even more powerful.… pic.twitter.com/yZIFHthnm5 — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) November 11, 2025 A Recent Breakout, Retest Highlighted As Trigger Based on reports, DOGE cleared the triangle in December 2024 during a US President Donald Trump-led crypto market boom, pushing above $0.48. The coin then came back to test the former trendline, which some traders call a normal step after a breakout. Other analysts have flagged similarities between today’s action and the token’s early bull runs, and some see that as confirmation for more upside. Short-Term Indicators Looking Up Technical numbers show a nearer-term forecast of a rise of 13.51% to $0.2002 by December 12, 2025. Current readings described by data providers list sentiment as Bearish and the Fear & Greed Index at 20 (Fear). Over the last 30 days DOGE had 13/30 (43%) green days and about 6.71% price volatility. Those numbers suggest that, for now, traders remain cautious even as longer-term charts are cited as bullish. Bitwise DOGE ETF Reports note that Bitwise moved forward with a DOGE ETF filing under Section 8(a) using CF Benchmarks’ settlement price, an action that could draw institutional interest if it progresses. Related Reading: XRP’s Next ‘Face-Melting’ Rally Could Hit Within 6 Weeks—Analyst Meanwhile, on-chain snapshots indicate that large holders are trimming supply, while retail activity has ticked up and some momentum indicators have turned higher. According to Bitwise, its fund would use the CF DOGE-Dollar Settlement Price from CF Benchmarks to calculate net asset value, which provides transparent, rules-based pricing across venues. If approved, this structure could make DOGE more accessible to institutions needing a regulated vehicle, potentially boosting order book depth and easing inflows or outflows. This increased access, combined with clearer pricing, could explain the recent movements in the market value of DOGE. Featured image from Gemini, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "SEC Chair Sets Out Plans For Crypto Taxonomy To Define Digital Asset Classification",
    "body": "In recent statements made by Chair Paul Atkins, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced a strategic plan targeted at giving much-needed clarity on the classification of crypto assets. Howey Test And Token Taxonomy In Crypto Atkins highlighted the forthcoming consideration of establishing a “token taxonomy” within the Commission, a structured framework rooted in legal rationale to discern between securities and commodities. He emphasized the importance of adhering to “limiting principles” in laws and regulations to ensure a cohesive approach towards crypto asset classification. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Bottom Out In 300 Days: Top Expert Forecasts $38,000 To $50,000 Price Point Atkins commended the efforts of Commissioner Hester Peirce, particularly her work in providing a transparent and economically grounded treatment of crypto assets under federal securities laws. The Chair emphasized three key themes in his address: the significance of a clear token taxonomy, the application of the Howey test in recognizing the temporary nature of investment contracts, and the practical implications for innovators, intermediaries, and investors in the evolving crypto landscape. Addressing the prevalent issue of distinguishing between securities and non-securities in the crypto space, Atkins noted that while most tokens are not inherently securities, certain tokens may have been sold within the context of an investment contract during a securities offering. However, he refuted the notion that every token involved in an investment contract perpetually retains its security status, emphasizing the importance of contextual analysis and recognizing the dynamic nature of investment contracts. Atkins Pledges Support For Evolving Digital Asset Laws In his remarks, Atkins also underscored the challenges faced by developers, exchanges, custodians, and investors in navigating the crypto ecosystem, where tokens serve various functions beyond traditional securities. He criticized the previous administration’s “blanket treatment” of all tokens as securities, highlighting the need for a more nuanced and practical approach to regulation to prevent stifling innovation and driving it offshore. Related Reading: China’s Cybersecurity Agency Alleges US Government Stole $13 Billion In Bitcoin In alignment with ongoing legislative efforts, Atkins reassured that the SEC aims to complement, rather than replace, existing crypto legislative initiatives. He emphasized the agency’s commitment to robust fraud enforcement and the development of clearer regulatory guidelines to ensure the safety of US investors. In closing, Atkins emphasized the importance of forward-looking regulatory practices, rejecting a stagnant approach rooted in fear of change. He reiterated the SEC’s commitment to delineating clear boundaries and providing transparent guidance. The statement concluded: That is what Project Crypto is about. That is what the Commission should be about. And that is the commitment I make to you today as Chairman: we will not let fear of the future trap us in the past.

    "body": "Following the recent comeback of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, Cypherpunk Technologies has launched a $50 million Zcash (ZEC) treasury strategy backed by Winklevoss Capital. Related Reading: SUI Eyes Key Retest As Price Breaks Out Of Downtrend – Rally To $3 Ahead? Cypherpunk Technologies Launches Zcash DAT On Wednesday, Leap Therapeutics announced the official launch of its Zcash Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) strategy and rebrand to Cypherpunk Technologies. The biotech company previously revealed that it had closed a $58.88 million private placement in October, led by Winklevoss Capital, as part of its plan to expand to the digital assets sector. The company currently holds 1.25% of the current ZEC supply after acquiring 203,775 ZEC at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $50 million, or $245.37 per token. Cypherpunk Technologies will reportedly continue to accumulate Zcash to own at least 5% of the total ZEC supply. The Company believes that privacy-protecting assets and related technologies will be critical in an increasingly digital world. The Company intends to acquire and hold ZEC, the native coin of Zcash, as its primary digital asset and to be an active participant in the Zcash community. Douglas E. Onsi, President and CEO of Cypherpunk Technologies, asserted that “This past month has been transformative for the Company, marked by closing a $58.88 million private placement led by Winklevoss Capital and successfully deploying $50 million to build a digital asset treasury designed to create long-term shareholder value focused on active participation in the development of Zcash and acquiring ZEC.” Per the announcement, the company will begin trading on Nasdaq under the new CYPH ticker on Thursday, November 13. Meanwhile, its ongoing cancer research and development operations will continue under a subsidiary that will take the Leap Therapeutics name. Winklevoss Twins Back ‘Encrypted Bitcoin’ In an X post, Gemini’s co-founder, Tyler Winklevoss, explained the reasons behind Winklevoss Capital’s investment in Cypherpunk Technologies, emphasizing the importance of supporting privacy and self-sovereignty in the online era. “Privacy is the precondition for many of our freedoms. It’s the point at which government and corporate reach end and our individual freedoms and self-sovereignty begin. As our lives have moved online, privacy’s become a rare, vanishing commodity,” the post reads. Winklevoss highlighted Zcash’s “highly symbiotic relationship” with Bitcoin since its launch nine years ago, affirming that, “If bitcoin is digital gold, Zcash is encrypted bitcoin, or digital cash.” One is your store of value, the other is how you privately move your value. We’ve been tracking this symbiosis for years and believe that now — as we enter the age of AI — is the right time to begin accumulating ZEC. Gemini’s co-founder also argued that Zcash could capture “a meaningful percentage” of BTC’s market capitalization, which he has predicted will surge to $1 million per BTC over the next 5-10years. Therefore, he believes that “Zcash will appreciate significantly from here as well.” Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Reclaims $3,500 Amid Market Rebound, Analysts Forecast December Take-Off It’s worth noting that Zcash has recorded a parabolic rally since September, surging 1,775% to its all-time high (ATH) of $750 last Friday. Since then, the cryptocurrency has followed the market’s correction, dropping over 40% to the $420 area before recovering. As of this writing, Zcash is trading at $507, a 15% increase in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "BREAKING – Crypto Markets Cheer As Trump Signs Bill Ending Gov’t Shutdown",
    "body": "United States President Donald Trump late Wednesday signed legislation that ended the country’s 43-day government shutdown, reopening federal agencies and restarting paused services after what had become the longest shutdown in modern history. Reports have disclosed the measure passed both houses this week and moves quickly to restore pay and services. Related Reading: Dogecoin Alert! Price Could Explode Over 2,800%, Analyst Says Funding Push Restores Pay And Services According to official House materials, the measure passed the House by a 222–209 vote and carries continuing appropriations that fund agencies through January 30, 2026. The bill covers several full-year appropriations and aims to return back pay to hundreds of thousands of federal workers who were furloughed or forced to work without pay. President Trump signs bill to OFFICIALLY reopen the government, ending the Democrat Shutdown. Let’s get our country WORKING again. 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/QJqX90k9sC — The White House (@WhiteHouse) November 13, 2025 Markets Liked The Certainty Risk assets jumped as lawmakers moved to end the standoff. Reports have disclosed Bitcoin climbed back toward the $105,000 area after the breakthrough, while broader crypto tokens also showed gains as traders priced in the reduction of fiscal uncertainty. Short, sharp moves in the market reflected traders unwinding defensive positions. Crypto Reaction In Numbers Bitcoin rose from lows near $99,300 earlier in the week to above $105,000 on news of progress, a move that some outlets measured as a roughly 6.7% uptick over recent sessions. Ethereum recovered toward about $3,600 as investors rotated back into riskier assets. These moves came alongside rallies in stocks and other risk markets. Based on reports from market commentators, the end of the shutdown reduced one layer of macro uncertainty. That made it easier for large funds and ETFs to move money without the risk of sudden policy disruption. Some short-term flows into crypto appear tied to renewed confidence that key infrastructure — like air travel and federal programs — will run normally again. Political Fallout And Next Steps Lawmakers from both parties have already signaled new fights ahead, with pressure to address policy items that were left out of the funding package. The White House framed the outcome as a win for governance, while critics said parts of the deal leave important programs and protections unresolved.

Volatility may return if political gridlock reemerges or if technical resistance levels hold for major tokens. The buying seen on the reopening was broad, but not unanimous, and many traders are watching whether flows remain steady into year-end. Featured image from ABC News, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "$30M Manipulation On Hyperliquid: The POPCAT Connection And What You Need To Know",
    "body": "Memecoin POPCAT experienced a significant downturn on Wednesday following a major manipulation event on Hyperliquid (HYPE), one of the leading decentralized exchanges in the cryptocurrency market. POPCAT Faces 43% Drop Following Manipulative Scheme According to a detailed analysis of the situation by DeFi researcher Hanzo on social media site X (previously Twitter), an unknown trader executed a well-coordinated strategy approximately 13 hours prior to the market disruption. The trader withdrew $3 million in USDC from the OKX exchange and distributed the funds across 19 different wallets on Hyperliquid. Subsequently, they initiated sizable long positions on POPCAT, accumulating total exposure estimated between $20 million and $30 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Bottom Out In 300 Days: Top Expert Forecasts $38,000 To $50,000 Price Point To create an illusion of demand for the memecoin, the trader placed a massive buy wall at the price point of $0.21, with orders totaling $30 million lined up on the order book. This artificial façade of high buying interest successfully attracted real traders, prompting them to jump on the bandwagon and increase their own buying activity. However, the situation took a swift turn when the trader removed the buy wall without warning, leading to an instantaneous collapse in the price of POPCAT. This shift resulted in the liquidation of all the long positions taken by traders. The unknown trader lost their $3 million collateral, while Hyperliquid’s HLP system automatically absorbed the open positions. This action triggered an additional loss of approximately $4.9 million to the HLP, exacerbating a broader market selloff across the token. Hyperliquid Faces Third Major Disruption This Year In the wake of the incident, the Hyperliquid team took emergency measures to stabilize the market and close any remaining exposures. Shortly after, the platform paused its Arbitrum (ARB) bridge, although it continued processing deposits and withdrawals normally. The community has expressed skepticism regarding the circumstances surrounding this incident, with many suggesting it may not have been a random liquidation. Instead, some believe the event could resemble a deliberate stress test or an attack aimed at destabilizing Hyperliquid’s liquidity system. Some contend that the rapid loss of millions in such a short time frame seems too calculated to be merely coincidental. Related Reading: China’s Cybersecurity Agency Alleges US Government Stole $13 Billion In Bitcoin This incident marks the third major market disruption on Hyperliquid in 2025, raising serious questions about the exchange’s approach to handling liquidity concentration and its systemic risk management practices, as noted by Hanzo in his analysis. Following the manipulation, the POPCAT memecoin saw a steep decline of approximately 43%, dropping from $0.21 to $0.12, with total liquidations reaching around $63 million. The decentralized exchange’s native token, HYPE, also declined significantly following the event. According to CoinGecko data, it is currently trading at $38.25, which is a 7% decrease on the weekly timeframe. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

Despite the Bitcoin price rallying, Shiba Inu has remained quite muted, failing to reach new all-time highs through the bull rally. Therefore, with only two months left in the year 2025, the question remains as to whether the Shiba Inu price can still rally to new all-time highs. Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Shiba Inu Price Trajectory The machine learning algorithm at the Coincodex website has shown a trajectory for the Shiba Inu price that suggests that the meme coin is destined for more sideways action this year. The prediction for the new year is that the meme coin will continue to trade in a very tight range. Related Reading: Institutions Have Been Buying Solana Every Day For 2 Weeks, Is $300 Possible? Even with the Shiba Inu price currently trending more than 88% below its all-time high from 2021, the machine learning algorithm does not see it bouncing anytime soon. For the rest of the year, the cryptocurrency is expected to trade under $0.000012. This puts it in the tight range of $0.00001-$0.000012. Interestingly, though, the same way the machine learning algorithm has predicted no increase, there is no expectation of a decline. The trajectory of the SHIB price over the next two months shows an almost straight line, and then continues into the year 2026 in the same manner. When Will SHIB Hit New All-Time Highs? According to the machine learning algorithm, SHIB investors awaiting the meme coin to hit a new all-time high have a long wait ahead of them. The long-term prediction suggests that the Shiba Inu price will not hit a new all-time high in the next decade.

For most of the time, the algorithm suggests that the cryptocurrency will only see double-digit growth for each year over the next couple of years. Interestingly, historical data also support muted performance for the Shiba Inu price for the rest of the year. CryptoRank website shows an average return of 0.31% for SHIB for the month of November and -9.84% for the month of December. If these hold, then it means that the SHIB price is more likely to decline than recover as the year moves toward an end. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",
