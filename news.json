    "title": "How Much Would You Have If You Put $500 In Bitcoin In 2014 Vs. XRP?",
    "body": "XRP and Bitcoin (BTC) were pitted against each other in a recent analysis, with market expert X Finance Bull revealing what early investors could have gained if they had invested $500 into both XRP and BTC in 2014. The analysis compares the performance of both cryptocurrencies over the years, highlighting the factors behind XRP’s growth and sustained momentum. What $500 In Bitcoin And XRP in 2014 Is Worth Today A new analysis by X Finance Bull reveals the dramatic growth potential of early investments in Bitcoin and XRP. According to the report, a $500 investment in XRP at the 2014 lows would be worth approximately $255,000 today. He compares XRP’s gains with those of Bitcoin, noting that if investors had bet the same amount in BTC in 2014, their investments would have grown to around $133,000. Related Reading: Analysts At Leading Wealth Manager Predict Bitcoin’s 2026 Price, And It’s Very Bullish These figures suggest that XRP outperformed Bitcoin by more than twice over the same period, delivering a 511-fold return, compared to BTC’s 266-fold gain. During that time, XRP’s performance benefited not only from early, steady adoption and speculative interest but also from the continued development of its underlying payment system. Over the years, XRP has moved beyond a purely speculative asset, gaining more traction as it evolves into a potential global settlement layer. Sharing similar sentiments, X Finance Bull highlighted how XRP’s infrastructure developments have significantly supported its significant price growth today. He noted that the cryptocurrency has seen major progress in areas such as Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), banking licenses, and enterprise-level adoption. Notably, XRP Spot ETFs officially launched in November 2025, attracting massive inflows that have significantly boosted demand for XRP among institutional investors. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has conditionally approved Ripple’s application to establish a national trust bank charter. All of these developments have contributed to XRP’s price growth over the past few months. Investors Reap Rewards For Holding XRP Through Volatility In his post, X Finance Bull suggested that investors who held onto their XRP positions through the volatile years “know why they held.” Following the cryptocurrency’s dramatic rally above $3, many investors reaped the rewards of staying invested from its lows and trusting in its potential for future price appreciation. Related Reading: XRP’s 1,500% Path To $24: Analyst Warns Investors To Be Prepared For When The Correction Resolves From 2018 to 2025, XRP struggled with a lawsuit filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). During those years of legal turmoil, many investors continued to hold onto their XRP despite the uncertainty and price stagnancy. Following Ripple’s legal win, XRP surpassed $3 in 2025, marking its first break above that level since 2018. Compared to XRP, Bitcoin has also experienced significant growth in the past few years. After crossing the $100,000 threshold in 2024, BTC continued its surge into 2025, finally hitting a peak above $126,000 in October. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Is Bitcoin A Better Investment Than Gold? Finance Expert Shares Deep Insights",
    "body": "Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has once again declared his support for Bitcoin, this time making a direct comparison between the digital asset and gold. In a recent post on social media, the New York Times bestselling author said that if he were forced to choose between the two, he would select Bitcoin over gold, citing the cryptocurrency’s actual design as the deciding factor. His comments quickly led to reactions from his followers, not only because of the comparison but also due to his own recent activity in the crypto market. Bitcoin Is A Better Investment Than Gold According to Kiyosaki, investing in Bitcoin is a much better decision than buying gold, and this is mostly due to the supply dynamics of the two assets. On a surface level, Kiyosaki noted that it would be obviously better to invest in both gold and Bitcoin, while also adding silver for diversification of assets. However, if he had to choose only one asset, he would choose Bitcoin. Related Reading: Contrary To Popular Belief, This Is Not The Worst Bitcoin Crash In History – Here’s The List Kiyosaki’s view on Bitcoin as a better investment is based on its hard supply cap of 21 million coins. Unlike gold, whose total reserves are uncertain and expandable through technological advancements and exploration, Bitcoin’s issuance schedule is mathematically predetermined. The protocol behind BTC makes sure that no more than 21 million coins will ever exist. As of now, over 19 million coins have already been mined, which means the network is close to its maximum supply threshold. According to Kiyosaki, this design is brilliant, and that means the price of Bitcoin should only go up. Based on Kiyosaki’s perspective, engineered scarcity gives Bitcoin a structural advantage over gold. If demand is growing while supply remains fixed, basic economic theory implies upward price pressure over the long term. “Glad I bought my Bitcoin early,” Kiyosaki said. From Selling BTC To Defending His Early Entry Claims Robert Kiyosaki rose to prominence with his 1997 bestselling book on personal finance called Rich Dad Poor Dad, which eventually rolled over into a series of personal finance books. Over the years, he has broadened his commentary to include real estate, precious metals, commodities, and, more recently, cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Forget A Bitcoin Yearly Top, BTC Price Might Have Hit A 16-Year Cyclical Peak In late 2025, Kiyosaki disclosed that he had sold a portion of his Bitcoin holdings. The disclosure came in November, around the time the price of Bitcoin fell below $90,000. According to him, he sold roughly $2.25 million worth of Bitcoin, explaining that the coins had originally been acquired years earlier at about $6,000 each. Speaking of buying Bitcoin at $6,000, Kiyosaki is claiming he stopped buying Bitcoin at $6,000. However, he has faced backlash for this claim. Recent community notes show Kiyosaki said on January 23, 2026, that he was continuously buying Bitcoin, alongside other assets like gold, silver, and Ethereum. Nonetheless, the gold-versus-Bitcoin discussion among investors is unlikely to stop anytime soon. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

Bitcoin is slowly moving lower below $68,800 and $68,000. The price is trading below $68,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $68,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might dip again if it trades below the $66,500 and $65,000 levels. Bitcoin Price Dips Again Bitcoin price failed to remain stable above the $70,000 zone. BTC started a fresh decline and traded below the $68,800 support zone . There was a push below $68,000. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $60,500 swing low to the $72,256 high. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $68,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin is now trading below $68,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average . If the price remains stable above $65,000, it could attempt a fresh increase. Immediate resistance is near the $68,200 level and the trend line. The first key resistance is near the $69,000 level. A close above the $69,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $70,000 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $71,500 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $72,000 and $72,500. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $69,000 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $66,000 level. The first major support is near the $65,000 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $60,500 swing low to the $72,256 high. The next support is now near the $63,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $62,000 support in the near term. The main support now sits at $61,200, below which BTC might struggle to recover in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level.

    "title": "More Bitcoin Ahead: Saylor, Strategy Commit To Regular BTC Purchases",
    "body": "Michael Saylor has doubled down on his company’s plan to keep buying Bitcoin on a regular schedule, saying that short-term swings will not change the approach. Related Reading: Jim Cramer Suggests US Government Could Buy Bitcoin Near $60K The message was simple and repeated: accumulation continues. Many in markets heard it as both reassurance and a reminder of how much the firm now depends on the asset. Saylor’s Quarterly Buying Plan According to public statements and company filings, the firm will keep making purchases every quarter. Reports say Bitcoin is being treated like a long-term reserve rather than a trading position. That means buys continue no matter what headlines scream today. The tactic is deliberate and steady. It is designed to smooth the entry points over time. A Massive Position And What It Means The company holds 714,644 Bitcoins. On its own pages the value runs into the tens of billions. That level of accumulation places the firm among the largest single holders of the coin, and with such scale comes concentration risk. The position was not built overnight. It was assembled over years, and much of it was funded through debt instruments tied to the company’s strategy of growth through accumulation. Bitcoin Price Action In Context Bitcoin has been volatile. It slid back below $70,000 this week after a run higher earlier in the year, and at one stage recently it had traded near a much higher peak that recalibrated many investors’ expectations. Short-term traders are uneasy. Long-term backers are unbothered. Price swings of this size can push shares of companies with large crypto exposure down sharply, which is what happened to the firm’s stock as market sentiment shifted. How Debt And Liquidity Factor In Reports say Strategy carries more than $8 billion in total debt, including notes created specifically to fund purchases. Cash on hand is being used to cover ordinary obligations, with the company noting it has enough to pay dividends for a period measured in years. Bitcoin Correlation With Tech Stocks Meanwhile, many market players now treat Bitcoin like a high-beta asset that moves with tech stocks in risk-on episodes, rather than like a safe haven that shines when fear rises. That shift in behavior is one reason some analysts have raised questions about the sustainability of a debt-financed accumulation model when prices move sharply lower. Related Reading: After Predicting XRP’s Drop, Analyst Says The Bottom May Be In Saylor’s Pledge And What Comes Next The commitment by Saylor and his team to buy each quarter is intact. The company says selling is not on the table. For outside observers, the question is whether steady accumulation funded in part by debt becomes a strength if prices recover, or a vulnerability if volatility persists and credit conditions tighten. The answer will emerge as market conditions unfold. Featured image from Vecteezy, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Ethereum Price Cracks $2,000, Opening Door To Deeper Selloff",
    "body": "Ethereum price started a fresh decline and traded below $2,000. ETH is now consolidating and remain at risk of another decline below $1,950. Ethereum struggled to extend gains above $2,020 and corrected lower. The price is trading below $2,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it stays below the $2,020 zone. Ethereum Price Dips Further Ethereum price failed to stay above $2,050 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH price traded below the $2,020 and $2,000 levels to enter a bearish zone. The pair dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,745 swing low to the $2,169 high. Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. However, the bulls were active near $1,900. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . If the bulls remain in action above $1,900, the price could attempt another increase. Immediate resistance is seen near the $1,960 level and the trend line. The first key resistance is near the $2,000 level. The next major resistance is near the $2,020 level. A clear move above the $2,020 resistance might send the price toward the $2,165 resistance. An upside break above the $2,165 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,250 resistance zone or even $2,280 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,000 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,920 level. The first major support sits near the $1,900 zone or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,745 swing low to the $2,169 high. A clear move below the $1,850 support might push the price toward the $1,820 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,750 region. The main support could be $1,720. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

    "body": "Bitcoin is facing renewed selling pressure after losing the key $70,000 level, a breakdown that has pushed the market into a more defensive phase. The inability to hold this psychological support has weighed on sentiment. With traders increasingly cautious as volatility rises and liquidity conditions remain uncertain. Price action near the mid-$60,000 range now represents a critical zone where market participants are assessing whether the current move is a deeper correction or simply another consolidation phase within the broader cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drop Wipes Billions From Recent Buyers: New Whale Cost Basis Falls Toward $90K On-chain data highlighted by analyst Axel Adler adds important context to the recent decline. According to his analysis, realized losses across the Bitcoin network have surged to levels comparable to those seen during the June 2022 Luna and UST crash. At first glance, this suggests significant stress and widespread capitulation among investors. However, the price backdrop is markedly different this time. Whereas the 2022 losses occurred when Bitcoin traded near $19,000, the current wave of loss realization is unfolding around $67,000. This distinction materially changes how the signal is interpreted. Rather than pointing to systemic market collapse, the data may reflect the flushing out of late-cycle buyers and leveraged positions, leaving Bitcoin at a pivotal stage where demand strength will determine the next directional move. Extreme Realized Losses Signal Capitulation, Not Structural Breakdown Axel Adler’s latest on-chain assessment highlights a sharp deterioration in Bitcoin’s realized profit and loss dynamics. The Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss 7-day moving average recently dropped to around -$1.99 billion, signaling large-scale loss-taking comparable to conditions seen during the June 2022 Luna-driven market shock. This metric tracks the balance between realized profits and losses from coins moving on-chain, offering a smoothed view of investor behavior over time. Although the indicator slightly recovered to roughly -$1.73 billion in the following days, it still represents the second-deepest negative reading on record. Net losses have remained below -$1.7 billion for several consecutive sessions. This indicates persistent seller pressure and ongoing capitulation among investors who entered the market at higher prices. Historically, a sustained return above zero has marked transitions back to profit-dominant market phases. Bitcoin Realized Loss has climbed to approximately $2.3 billion on a 7-day basis, a level comparable to peak stress during the 2022 crash. However, the broader context differs significantly. Similar loss volumes are now occurring near $67,000 rather than $19,000, suggesting a cyclical flush of late bull-market entrants rather than systemic market failure or structural network deterioration. Related Reading: Ethereum Holders Shift To Self-Custody As Market Consolidates Near $2K Bitcoin Breakdown Extends As Momentum Remains Bearish Bitcoin’s daily chart reflects sustained downside pressure after the decisive loss of the $70,000 level. The price is now hovering in the mid-$60,000 range following a sharp decline. The move confirms a clear shift in short-term market structure, characterized by lower highs, accelerating selloffs, and repeated failures to reclaim former support zones. This pattern typically signals weakening bullish momentum and increasing caution among market participants. Technically, Bitcoin is trading below key moving averages, which now act as overhead resistance rather than support. The inability to recover these levels suggests that sellers continue to dominate short-term price action. Recent spikes in trading volume during the drop reinforce the idea of forced deleveraging and defensive positioning rather than orderly rotation or accumulation. Related Reading: Ethereum Crash Below $2,000 Triggers Record Token Movement: Hinting At Capitulation The $60,000–$62,000 region emerges as the next critical support area. Aligning with prior consolidation zones and historical liquidity clusters. Holding this range would help stabilize sentiment and potentially enable consolidation. A break below it, however, could open the door to deeper retracement scenarios. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Flashes Luna-Level Capitulation Signal at $67K, Not $19K",
    "body": "Bitcoin is printing on-chain loss-taking on a scale last seen during the Luna/UST meltdown, but at a radically different price point, a distinction that changes what the signal likely means for this drawdown. Axel Adler Jr. said Bitcoin’s Net Realized Profit/Loss has sunk deep into negative territory, with the 7-day moving average falling to -$1.99 billion on Feb. 7 before improving slightly to -$1.73 billion by Feb. 10. That places the current regime among the most severe loss-dominant stretches on record. Adler described it as “the second deepest negative reading in the entire history of observations,” exceeded only by June 18, 2022, when the metric hit -$2.24 billion amid the Luna/UST crash and cascading liquidations. The key detail, Adler argues, is persistence. Net Realized Profit/Loss has stayed below roughly -$1.7 billion for five consecutive days, forming what he framed as a sustained cluster of seller pressure, the kind of multi-day compression that typically marks capitulation behavior rather than a single shock print. In Adler’s framing, the mechanic is straightforward: realized losses are dominating realized profits on moved coins, and the market is working through the supply owned by participants forced or willing to sell below their cost basis. Related Reading: These Three Catalysts Could Spark Bitcoin’s Next Rally, According To Wintermute “The depth and duration of the current negative regime point to massive capitulation of participants who bought coins at higher levels,” he wrote. “The key reversal trigger is the return of Net Realized Profit/Loss above zero, which would signal the market’s transition from loss dominance to profit dominance. As long as the metric remains in deeply negative territory, seller pressure persists.” Bitcoin Losses Match Luna Crash Scale The companion chart, Bitcoin Realized Loss (7DMA), shows realized losses rising to about $2.3 billion on Feb. 7 and holding near that level through Feb. 10, another rarity in historical context. Adler called it “one of the highest smoothed levels in the entire history of observations,” explicitly comparing it to June 2022. He also emphasized that the 7-day smoothing understates peak stress in real time. At the height of the 2022 episode, Adler noted, single-day losses were roughly three times higher than the weekly-smoothed figure. In the current window, he pointed to a single-day realized loss of $6.05 billion on Feb. 5, the second-largest one-day loss in Bitcoin’s history, according to his note. The headline comparison, however, is not just magnitude but setting. In 2022, a similar realized-loss regime occurred with bitcoin trading around $19,000. This time, Adler says, the losses are being crystallized around $67,000 after a pullback from $125,000, a context he frames as a correction that is flushing out late entries rather than an ecosystem-wide failure cascade. Related Reading: Bitcoin Chart Screams 2022 Bear Market, Until You Notice What’s Missing “Back then, Realized Loss at $2.7B was occurring at a price of $19K,” Adler wrote. “Now, comparable loss volumes are being locked in at a price of $67K, which suggests not a systemic crash but rather a flushing out of late bull-cycle entries. This is capitulation of local top buyers, not a fundamental loss of network value.” Adler’s playbook puts two markers front and center. The first is a sustained move of Net Realized Profit/Loss (7DMA) back above zero for multiple weeks, which he frames as the transition from loss dominance to profit dominance. The second is a decline of Realized Loss (7DMA) below $1 billion, which would indicate that the wave of forced or pain-driven selling is fading. The risk, in his view, is that the market’s “cleansing stress” shifts into something more final if price weakness compounds. Adler flagged the sub-$60,000 area as a line where continued growth in realized losses alongside further price decline could turn a correction into “full-blown capitulation”, not because the current prints are small, but because the regime could extend and deepen. For now, Adler’s core claim is that Bitcoin is producing Luna-sized loss signals without Luna-like structural damage. Same order of magnitude on-chain, different story in the tape. At press time, BTC traded at $67,924. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Social Sentiment Stays Bearish Even As Price Recovers From $60,000 Drop",
    "body": "Data shows the social media sentiment around Bitcoin has remained deeply bearish despite the recovery that the cryptocurrency’s price has made. Social Media Data Suggests Retail Still Fearful About Bitcoin In a new post on X, analytics firm Santiment has discussed about how the Positive/Negative Sentiment for Bitcoin has developed on social media following the recent recovery surge in the asset’s price. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Selloff Continues As Supply Share Drops Under 75% The Positive/Negative Sentiment refers to an indicator that tells us, as its name suggests, how the positive and negative sentiments related to a given asset compare on the major social media platforms. The metric works by putting social media posts/threads/messages containing mentions of the asset through a machine-learning model to differentiate between positive and negative comments. Then, it counts up the number of posts in each category and finds their ratio. When the value of the indicator is greater than 1, it means the asset is observing more bullish messages than bearish ones. On the other hand, the metric being under this threshold implies the dominance of a negative sentiment. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Positive/Negative Sentiment for Bitcoin over the last few months: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Positive/Negative Sentiment rose to a notable level when the asset saw its rally in January. This suggests that retail traders on social media became greedy. What eventually followed the market greed was a top in the cryptocurrency and a reversal to the downside. As this drawdown took BTC back to the $60,000 level, the Positive/Negative Sentiment plummeted, meaning that fear now dominated social media platforms. Just like how the greedy sentiment led into a top, this bearish mentality paved way for a rebound instead. This is a pattern that has been witnessed with digital asset markets time and time again, with prices tending to move against the expectations of the crowd. Interestingly, even though BTC has climbed back into the high $60,000 levels since its low, the Positive/Negative Sentiment has continued to be at low levels. “Historically, while FUD is high, price rebounds have a heightened probability,” noted the analytics firm. It now remains to be seen how Bitcoin will develop in the near future, given the current bearish sentiment.

    "body": "ZRO, the native token of the omnichain interpretability protocol LayerZero, has skyrocketed more than 40% on the past day following the announcement of its new Layer-1 (L1) blockchain backed by major institutional players. Related Reading: XRP Positioned For Major Structure Shift As Price Tests Critical Level LayerZero Unveils Zero Blockchain On Tuesday, LayerZero Labs announced a new L1 blockchain, Zero, aimed at institutional financial markets. According to the announcement, it is set to launch in fall 2026, with three initial “zones,” described as permissionless environments fully owned and governed by the underlying network. Moreover, ZRO will serve as the network’s native token, providing interoperability between Zones and across the 165+ blockchains it connects. Designed to “eliminate the long-standing scalability challenges of decentralized networks,” Zero is set to process 2 million transactions per second (TPS) per Zone and charge near-zero fees by targeting four primary bottlenecks. “By leveraging Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs to decouple execution from verification, Zero transitions the network from redundant replication to a heterogeneous architecture,” LayerZero Labs explained on X. “This structural shift allows for two distinct validator classes: lightweight Block Validators capable of running on low-grade consumer hardware and optional higher performance Block Producers,” it continued. Bryan Pellegrino, CEO of LayerZero Labs, affirmed that Zero’s architecture advances the industry’s roadmap by at least a decade. “We believe we can actually bring the entire global economy onchain with this technology. Our mission is to build permissionless infrastructure for a better world – this is the beginning of that world,” he added. Zero Receives Major Institutional Backing The rollout was backed by key institutional players, including Citadel Securities, The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), ARK Invest, Google Cloud, and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Notably, Citadel Securities is collaborating to evaluate how its technology could apply to trading, clearing, and settlement workflows. Additionally, it made a strategic investment in ZRO. ARK Invest is becoming a shareholder of LayerZero equity and ZRO. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood, the company’s CEO and CIO, joined LayerZero’s new advisory board alongside Michael Blaugrund, VP of Strategic Initiatives at ICE, and Caroline Butler, former head of digital assets at BNY Mellon. “This is a historic opportunity at the intersection of finance and the internet. I am thrilled to join LayerZero’s advisory board and help accelerate the adoption of Zero by the largest markets and companies in the world,” Wood said in a statement. DTCC will investigate the Zero blockchain architecture to enhance the scalability of the DTC Tokenization Service and collateral management, while ICE will examine it for 24/7 trading and tokenized collateral. Moreover, Google Cloud partnered to explore how to enable AI agents to make micropayments and trade resources instantly. Tether also announced a separate strategic investment in LayerZero Labs on Tuesday. ZRO Price Skyrockets Following the news, ZRO soared more than 40% in the last 24 hours, hitting a four-month high of $2.59 on Wednesday morning. The cryptocurrency had been trading between the $1.50 and $2.00 area over the past few weeks, reaching a local low of $1.35 during last week’s crash. Now, the recent momentum has pushed LayerZero back above the $2.00 area and toward a major resistance area. The cryptocurrency has been unable to reclaim the $2.60 mark since June, being rejected from this area after each retest. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See New Drop To $60,000 Despite Bounce – Here’s The Level To Defend If ZRO reclaims $2.60, it could target the next major resistance, located at around $3.00. Analyst Crypto Tony affirmed that if the cryptocurrency clears this level, “we are good for $3.30. Wave 3 is beginning.” As of this writing, ZRO is trading at $2.45, a 36.5% increase in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Community Day Recap: The 7 Most Bullish Takeaways",
    "body": "Ripple used XRP Community Day to tighten its message: XRP is not an accessory to the business, it’s the organizing principle and the company is positioning its product stack, regulatory posture, and institutional roadmap around that premise. XRP Community Day Highlights CEO Brad Garlinghouse went straight for the ceiling. “There will be a trillion dollar crypto company, I don’t doubt that for a second,” he said. “I think Ripple has the opportunity to be that company, and maybe there’ll be more than one.” The framing matters because it’s not a token price call — it’s a scale argument about where regulated rails, liquidity, and enterprise distribution could concentrate as XRP plugs further into legacy finance. Policy was the second major pillar. Garlinghouse put odds on the table for US legislation, predicting a “75%” chance the CLARITY Act will be “very close to getting signed by the end of April.” Related Reading: XRP Positioned For Major Structure Shift As Price Tests Critical Level Garlinghouse also tried to reconcile market volatility with institutional appetite, pointing to ETF flow behavior during a rough tape. “I believe in a multi-chain world. Even last week, when there was massive carnage going on in the market, there was positive XRP ETF inflows of $30M or $40M,” he said. “Public markets are keen to invest in crypto. Customers want it.” The compliance posture was framed less as defensive and more as a competitive moat by Garlinghouse. “We want to be the most regulated, compliant, because we’re focused on institutional flows—that is the priority,” Garlinghouse said. “The OCC charter makes it very clear that RLUSD is a leader under the GENIUS Act, it cements our leading position.” In Ripple’s telling, regulatory credentials aren’t a cost center; they’re how you win mandates, counterparties, and distribution in the parts of the market that actually move size. He also hinted at some major progress on the Fed Masters Account. “Now, there’s been a lot of speculation about what we could do in the future,” Garlinghouse said. “There’s been some commentary about a Fed Master Account, which we do think is compelling. And there’s things we may do in the future that I’m not gonna go into today.” He then anchored the point in trajectory rather than rumor: conditional OCC approval and engagement, he said, represent “massive progress relative to where we started this journey.” Related Reading: Glassnode: XRP Is Back In Its 2021-2022 Playbook As SOPR Drops Sub 1 On XRP itself, Garlinghouse delivered the cleanest thesis statement of the event: “XRP is the north star for Ripple. It’s our purpose.” He tied Ripple Payments, Ripple Prime, Ripple Treasury, custody, and RLUSD to a single objective: “how we can drive utility, trust, liquidity around XRPL.” President Monica Long expanded that into an execution roadmap: “We’re rewinding the tape back to the founding of the company, like XRP and the Ledger are our reason for being,” she said. “So we call it our North Star, like that this is kind of what guides us in a lot of our product strategy and decision-making.” From there, she outlined three institutional-flavored pushes: bringing more licensed payments flow onto the XRPL DEX, a “payments credit” concept that matches payment-provider financing needs with XRP holders seeking yield via a proposed lending protocol amendment, and growing custody demand as banks move past safekeeping and into tokenization of deposits, funds, and traditional securities. At press time, XRP traded at $1.38. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Trapped In Bear Market Woes As Liquidity Runs Dry, Is Another Crash Coming?",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s price structure is showing signs of strain, and new data from CryptoQuant shows that fresh capital is no longer entering the market. Instead of the recent drawdown acting as an attraction for buyers, it appears to be triggering withdrawals. This change in liquidity behavior is important, as it indicates that Bitcoin may be transitioning into deeper bear market conditions. Notably, on-chain metrics tracking new liquidity flows are revealing negative cumulative inflows over the past month. Selling Pressure Builds, New Investor Inflows Flip Negative According to a recent analysis that was done on the CryptoQuant platform, Bitcoin’s 30-day cumulative new investor flow has dropped to approximately $2.6 billion. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals The Best Time To Buy Bitcoin And The Best Time To Sell This metric was revealed from CryptoQuant’s ‘Bitcoin New Investor Flow’ data, which is revealing that more capital is leaving the ecosystem than entering it. The data shows that the ongoing dip is failing to attract meaningful participation from new buyers. Interestingly, the current reading of this metric is displaying a huge contrast between previous bull phases and current conditions. Large spikes in new money, visible in blue in the chart below, accompanied strong price rallies, particularly in 2017, 2021, and again during the 2024-2025 bull market. Those inflow surges coincided with powerful upside momentum in terms of price action. At present, those spikes are notably absent. Instead, the lower section of the chart is displaying growing red readings due to net capital outflows. The latest print is below zero, which shows that sell-offs are not being absorbed by fresh liquidity. This dynamic matters because markets rely on marginal buyers to sustain higher prices. When new participants step back, price action becomes vulnerable to deeper pullbacks. That is why there is a need for new buyers to absorb the selloffs. Low Liquidity Raises Crash Risks Although liquidity contraction does not automatically guarantee another major crash, it increases fragility of price action. Bitcoin, for one, is still trading below $70,000, although bulls have largely prevented further breakdowns below $60,000. This, in turn, has kept the Bitcoin price trading in a range around $70,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Caught Between Two Liquidity Traps — Which Side Breaks First? However, many crypto analysts are of the notion that Bitcoin could still crash further to lower price levels. Calls for a deeper correction are circulating across trading platforms and social media, with projected bottoms stretching from around $55,000 to as low as $30,000. The absence of inflow spikes suggests that Bitcoin may struggle to regain momentum in the near term. If liquidity continues to dry up, the probability of another significant leg lower before a rebound increases. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at $67,160, reflecting a modest 0.3% gain over the past 24 hours. This price behavior is unfolding alongside a slowdown in mining activity due to miners shutting down their systems, which led to the largest mining difficulty drop since 2021.

Tom DeMark, whose models are followed by macro legends like Paul Tudor Jones and used across institutional desks, says a final undercut near $1,890 would “perfect” the bottom. That… pic.twitter.com/j9zWoUOLgP — SamAlτcoin.eth (@SAMALTCOIN_ETH) February 11, 2026 Market conditions are not identical now, yet patterns matter because traders use them. Some analysts have highlighted the $1,890 level as a likely low. They said it might be probed twice in an “undercut” before stabilizing. That kind of setup is common in volatile markets and is used to find entry points. Staking Squeezes Liquid Supply Reports note that staking demand remains strong even while prices fall. The validator entry queue has swollen to about 21 days, with roughly 4 million ETH waiting to be accepted. That has left more than 30% of the total supply locked up — about 36.7 million ETH. People are earning roughly 2.80% APR on staked coins, a modest return by crypto standards, but enough to persuade many holders to lock funds away. When large sums are immobilized like this, tradable supply thins and price reactions can be amplified on both the way down and the way up. Related Reading: More Bitcoin Ahead: Saylor, Strategy Commit To Regular BTC Purchases Ethereum Price Action And Market Strain Market moves have been sharp. ETH slid to about $1,900 at the time of writing, down 5.4% in the last seven days, and has failed to hold above $2,000 in recent days. Over the last 30 days, the token fell roughly 36%. Heavy liquidations have been recorded, with more than $1 billion in positions closed out as leverage was forced to unwind. That generated fast selling and left traders cautious. Economic data, geopolitical headlines, and anticipation of US inflation readings have added to the nervous mood. Some desks now treat any bounce as tentative until volatility eases. Whether that rebound comes fast or takes time, Lee’s stance is clear: sharp drops have not marked the end for Ethereum in the past. He sees the current stress as another chapter in a familiar cycle, not a structural break. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Dogecoin Is Now In The ‘Maximum Opportunity / Minimum Risk’ Zone: Crypto Analyst",
    "body": "Dogecoin is flashing what crypto analyst Cryptollica (@Cryptollica) calls on X a rare “maximum opportunity / minimum risk” setup, as long-horizon indicators on a DOGE-versus-dollar proxy chart push into levels that previously coincided with cycle lows. Why This Could Be The ‘Maximum Opportunity’ For Dogecoin In a Feb. 11 post on X, Cryptollica shared a 10-day DOGE chart denominated against the US Dollar Index (DXY), arguing the slower timeframe “filters out the intraday noise and reveals the true cyclical nature of the asset.” The analyst framed the move as a reset back to a historically important base level and pointed to momentum readings that, in past cycles, marked capitulation. Related Reading: Why Dogecoin (DOGE) Can’t Break $0.10 Despite Short-Term Bounce and Neutral RSI At the center of Cryptollica’s thesis is a black horizontal line on the DOGE/DXY 10-day chart — a level the analyst described as the historic “Launchpad.” “The black horizontal line represents the historic ‘Launchpad.’ In early 2021, this level was the breakout resistance that ignited the bull run (ELON),” Cryptollica wrote. “In 2022, 2023, and now 2026, this same level is acting as a macro support fortress. Price has returned to its origin.” That framing leans on a classic market-structure idea: prior resistance that becomes support can act as a memory point for positioning and risk-taking, especially when the market revisits it after a full boom-bust loop. Cryptollica also highlighted the 10-day RSI sitting at 34, referencing a “red line” zone on the indicator. The claim: when DOGE’s RSI reached that same zone in prior stress periods, including 2015, March 2020, and 2022, it preceded meaningful rebounds. “Every time the RSI touched this zone (2015, March 2020 (covid crash), 2022), it marked a cyclical bottom followed by a significant rally,” Cryptollica wrote. “We are mathematically in the ‘Maximum Opportunity / Minimum Risk’ zone.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Bear Market Almost Over? Crypto Analyst Weighs In The post stops short of calling for immediate upside, but the language suggests the analyst sees skew shifting: less perceived downside relative to the potential upside if a new expansion phase begins. Is The Dogecoin Bottom In? In a separate chart shared on Wednesday, Cryptollica mapped DOGE/USDT on a 3-day timeframe, sketching a wide channel with a labeled TopLine, Midline, and BottomLine. The chart annotates prior turning points around $0.75, $0.49, $0.22, and $0.09, with price now drifting back toward the lower boundary near the $0.07–$0.08 area. Cryptollica captioned the second image simply: “DOGE BOTTOM ?” Taken together, the posts lay out a conditional thesis rather than a timed call: DOGE has rotated back to a historically important support reference on a macro-style pair (DOGE/DXY), while momentum sits in a zone that previously aligned with cycle inflection points. Whether that historical rhyme turns into a repeat will likely hinge on whether the “launchpad” support holds and whether DOGE can reclaim higher range levels marked on the longer timeframe channel rather than continuing to bleed along the bottom boundary. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.09366. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Bitcoin’s recent slide has left traders squinting at charts and asking the same blunt question: correction or crash? Prices have tumbled sharply, but some market watchers still see this as a deep pullback inside a longer uptrend. Others warn the data points to something colder. Related Reading: Jim Cramer Suggests US Government Could Buy Bitcoin Near $60K Price Decline And Hard Numbers According to XWIN Research’s CryptoQuant analysis, Bitcoin has fallen about 46% from a peak near $126,000 and now trades around $67,900 after five straight months of losses. The Fear & Greed Index sits at 14 — a reading labeled Extreme Fear. Reports note that net realized losses recently hit over $13 billion, a level that matched the worst stretches of the 2022 slump. In 2024, roughly $10 billion of inflows helped lift market cap. Then in 2025, more than $300 billion flowed in while the overall market value shrank. That odd mix of heavy inflows and falling market cap suggests selling pressure is higher than fresh buying. How Rising Prices Are Masking a Quiet Shift in Bitcoin’s Structure “The base scenario is that Bitcoin may already be entering winter, with higher prices and stronger structure delaying recognition.” – By @xwinfinance Read more ⤵️https://t.co/7soxNoBhqi pic.twitter.com/fEsSXpAmuK — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 11, 2026 Capital Flows Versus Price Action Based on reports, the capital flow numbers are the most awkward fact for bulls. Money moved in, but value fell. Who was selling into that demand? Large holders, paper traders, or complex derivatives desks might have taken profits or hedged positions. The data alone doesn’t name the seller, but the pattern is a red flag. On-chain measures also reveal shrinking realized gains even as prices remained far above prior bear-era levels. That tends to weaken the internal strength of the market over time. Sentiment And Historical Echoes Some traders point to a quirk of memory: high nominal prices make pain feel milder. People don’t want to relive the chaos of 2022. Reports say the launch of spot ETFs and deeper institutional access have changed the market’s plumbing, and that gives many confidence. Yet sentiment readings at extreme fear often show up near capitulation points. It’s worth remembering that in 2022 realized losses peaked about five months before the market bottom, which means big losses can precede a final low by a long stretch. Technical Patterns And The Bigger Picture Bitcoin posted four consecutive losing months and a 41% decline across that stretch — a streak last seen during 2018 rather than 2022. That pattern matters because similar sequences have led to extended downturns in the past. Related Reading: More Bitcoin Ahead: Saylor, Strategy Commit To Regular BTC Purchases Bitcoin At A Crossroads As XWIN Flags Early Signs Of Crypto Winter For XWIN Research, the message is simple: price alone does not define the cycle. What matters is who is buying, who is selling, and whether demand can absorb supply without market value shrinking. Right now, that balance looks strained. Until inflows begin translating into sustained market cap growth and realized losses cool meaningfully, the firm believes the market should be treated with caution rather than optimism. Winter may not have fully arrived, but based on the data, the temperature is clearly dropping. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Leading On-Chain Analyst Sees A Floor Forming",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s violent drawdown into the low-$60,000s has traders hunting for a floor. One of the market’s best-known on-chain analysts is arguing the risk-reward has shifted meaningfully, even if the “bottom” is still a process rather than a single print. James “Checkmate” Check, a former lead Glassnode researcher and now the author of Check On Chain, told What Bitcoin Did host Danny Knowles that once Bitcoin pushed into the $60,000 zone, it entered what he described as “deep value” territory across multiple mean-reversion frameworks, at the same time capitulation-style losses spiked to levels last seen at the 2022 cycle lows. Check’s core framing is blunt: if Bitcoin is headed to zero, none of the models matter. If it’s not, then the statistical setup looks increasingly asymmetric after the selloff. “If Bitcoin is going to zero, been nice playing. It’s been fun have fun playing with your bitcoins,” Check said. “If not, then you start looking at the statistics and the odds and go, ‘Well, if Bitcoin recovers, this is kind of a nice place to be. Don’t lose attention now. This is the time to pay attention.’” Related Reading: These Three Catalysts Could Spark Bitcoin’s Next Rally, According To Wintermute Check was less interested in pinning the move on a single forced seller than in walking through the market structure that made the slide plausible. IS THE BITCOIN BOTTOM IN? | @_Checkmatey_ We discuss: – The Bitcoin Bear Market – If $60k Is The Bottom – What Caused The Crash – How To Manage The Bear Watch it here: https://t.co/j6OTvdnWFc pic.twitter.com/Z0f1VaKkFd — Danny Knowles (@_DannyKnowles) February 11, 2026 Bitcoin Bottoms Are A Process His conclusion was probabilistic, not declarative. “The odds that we’ve put a bottom in have gone up significantly,” he said, adding later that he’d put the chance the market already set a meaningful low at “more than 50/50 […] probably 60%,” while assigning just “15–20%” odds of a new all-time high in 2026 without a major macro “pivot” or “big print” event. On ETFs, Check cited roughly $7.5 billion in outflows during the drawdown, while arguing the bigger picture looked less like a structural failure and more like positioning unwinds. He said that at around $80,000, roughly 62% of cumulative inflows were underwater, but noted ETF assets under management were down only mid-single digits (he referenced about 4–6%), and suggested earlier outflows aligned with CME open interest, consistent with basis-trade window-dressing rolling off. Check pushed back hard on anchoring to the four-year halving cycle as a timing tool, calling it an “unnecessary bias.” His approach: watch investor behavior first, check the calendar second. “Show me when investors put the bottom in. Show me when investors sell the top,” he said. “I’m going to look at that instead because then I’ll check the date.” Even if the low is in, Check expects the market to revisit it. Bottoms, he argued, tend to form through multiple “capitulation wicks” and then “time pain,” where boredom and lingering fear grind down late-cycle buyers. “If you are formulating a bear case right now, you’re doing it wrong,” he said, framing the current zone as the late innings of the move rather than the start, while still allowing price could go lower. He pointed to two failed all-time-high attempts around October, topping near $126,000, followed by a “shot across the bow” crash on Oct. 10 that he said likely left “bodies out there.” From there, he described a “hodler’s wall” of invested wealth sitting above key levels, with $95,000 as what he called the “bull’s last stand” and argued that once price lost those shelves, downside odds accelerated. A key reference level for him was $80,000, tied to the True Market Mean, a long-term center-of-gravity price that also overlapped with the ETF cost basis in his telling. Once that level broke, he said, the psychological regime changed: “Losing $80,000 was the acceptance phase. Now everyone believes that it’s a bear market. And what bear markets do, they trend lower.” From there, Check argued the market was pulled toward the prior high-volume consolidation zone, roughly the mid-$50,000s to $70,000 range, where a large share of this cycle’s trading volume had previously occurred. He said the selloff itself likely involved leverage blowing up somewhere, but framed that as downstream of a broader shift: when the crowd believes it’s a downtrend, they “sell every rip.” The most concrete “bottoming” signal Check emphasized was the scale of realized losses during the flush. He said capitulation losses ran around $1.5 billion per day, a figure he compared directly to the 2022 bottom and that the sellers were concentrated among recent cohorts: “class of 2025” and “class of 2026” buyers, plus people who bought the $80,000 bear-flag region. He also flagged SOPR printing around minus one standard deviation, which he said has only appeared in two historical contexts: an early “this isn’t a dip” warning, and later near bottoming phases.

    "title": "Ethereum Whales Are Not Dead: The $400 Million Move That Shows What’s Going On",
    "body": "Ethereum whales have continued to accumulate despite the current downtrend in the ETH price, providing a bullish outlook for the second-largest crypto by market cap. Notably, ETH withdrawals from exchanges recently reached their highest level since October last year, totaling over $400 million. Ethereum Whales Accelerate Withdrawals From Exchanges Crypto analyst Arab Chain noted in a CryptoQuant analysis that rising Ethereum withdrawals from exchanges have reached their highest level since October. The analyst noted that the exchange netflow data over the past few days indicates a clear acceleration in withdrawal activity. This signals a shift in Ethereum whales’ behavior as demand outpaces supply. Related Reading: Can Ethereum Price Still Hit $7,600 In 2026? Here Are The Odds Arab Chain revealed that across all exchanges, the net Ethereum outflows have exceeded 220,000 ETH, marking the highest level of withdrawals since October last year. This suggests that Ethereum whales are moving their coins to private wallets or long-term storage protocols, a move that the analyst noted is often associated with accumulation phases or risk-reduction behavior. Notably, daily net outflows on Binance reached nearly 158,000 ETH on February 5, the largest since August last year. Arab Chain stated that this confirms that a substantial portion of the recent outflows has been concentrated on the exchange with the deepest liquidity. From a price perspective, the analyst noted that the Ethereum whale accumulation coincided with ETH trading near the $1,800 to $2,000 range. Therefore, these Ethereum whales may see these levels as attractive zones for holding or repositioning amid this crypto market downtrend. Arab Chain added that the continued outflow of ETH from exchanges at this scale reduces immediate selling pressure and could provide near-term support for the ETH price, especially if the market gains momentum again. Ethereum Staking Hits New High According to Token Terminal, Ethereum staking has surpassed 30% of the total supply, marking a new all-time high (ATH) in terms of staking ratio. Market commentator The Milk Road noted that this means that 36.8 million ETH, around $72 billion, is now locked up, with almost 1 million validators securing the network. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Set To Break Out Against Bitcoin, But How High Can It Go? The Milk Road further described this development as a sign of conviction in the Ethereum ecosystem, noting that these whales are willing to lock up $74 billion during a market downtrend. Notably, the staking exit queue is around 4.1 million ETH, which the market commentator remarked is nothing compared to what is currently staked. Interestingly, it also takes about 72 days to stake ETH at the moment, with staking demand at a new high. Meanwhile, the Milk Road also noted that the obvious impact is a significant supply restriction, which is a bullish catalyst for the ETH price. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $1,965, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",
