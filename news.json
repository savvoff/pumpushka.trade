    "body": "Ethereum price started a fresh decline from the $3,400 resistance. ETH is now consolidating losses and holding the key support at $3,200. Ethereum started a sharp downside correction below $3,320. The price is trading below $3,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $3,220 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $3,180 zone. Ethereum Price Dips To Support Ethereum price failed to remain stable above $3,300 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH price declined below $3,280 and $3,250 to enter a bearish zone.

If the bulls can protect more losses below $3,180 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $3,060 swing low to the $3,402 high, the price could attempt another increase. Immediate resistance is seen near the $3,230 level. The first key resistance is near the $3,250 level. The next major resistance is near the $3,280 level. A clear move above the $3,280 resistance might send the price toward the $3,320 resistance. An upside break above the $3,320 region might call for more gains in the coming days.

    "title": "XRP Is Doing Something It Hasn’t Done Since 2021: Here’s Why It Matters",
    "body": "XRP is flashing a rare relative-strength signal against ETH, according to crypto analyst Matt Hughes (“The Great Mattsby”), who points to a 2-week Ichimoku cloud flip that he says hasn’t meaningfully held as support since 2021. With XRP also boxed inside a defined USD range on lower timeframes, Hughes frames the next phase as a conditional “prove it” moment: reclaim one level, and the market has room to work; fail it, and the breakout narrative stays premature. XRP Poised To Outperform ETH? Hughes’ primary claim is anchored to the XRP/ETH pair on a 2-week chart. In his read, there’s a massive regime change: “When looking at the 2-week Ichimoku cloud, you can see that XRP is doing something it hasn’t done since 2021: flipping the 2-week cloud to support. The cloud has been a massive resistance for most of the chart’s history until now (with a notable breakout in 2021, but only a few weeks).” On Hughes’ chart, XRP/ETH is pressing into the top side of the 2-week Ichimoku cloud, with the latest candle marked around 0.00062. His bullish read is that a clean flip, price holding above the cloud and treating it as a floor on pullbacks, would be a regime change for the pair. XRP Roadmap To $9 Hughes’ shorter-timeframe work shifts from relative performance to mechanics in spot USD terms. On the daily XRP/USD chart, price is still behaving like a market that has not resolved its larger consolidation, oscillating between stacked horizontal levels while respecting sloping fan lines that visually reinforce why upside attempts have repeatedly stalled. Related Reading: XRP To Repeat Its 2017 Playbook? Analyst Forecasts 1,250% Expansion Hughes boils that structure down to one actionable threshold: “Price moves in increments, and this Gann fan perfectly illustrates why price is stuck in its current range. Once XRP can close candles above $2.30, the move up can continue.” Above that, the next targets on the daily timeframe are $2.59 and $2.95. The weekly XRP/USD chart adds the next level if that acceptance arrives. Two extension levels (drawn from the 2014 low to the 2017 high) are explicitly marked: 2.272 at $3.09882 and 2.618 at $9.00194, with Hughes’ drawn path stepping first toward the low-$3 area before stretching higher if momentum persists. Related Reading: Surge In XRP Transactions: 1.45 Million Daily Users Could Signal Price Rally Ahead, Says Expert Thus, Hughes’ bullish scenario is a two-part sequence: first, clear the USD range trigger (a sustained close above $2.30), then convert the last major zone before the 2025 high into support. He states it in more pointed terms on X: “XRP’s been grinding sideways for 1+ year while many other alts were bleeding. Not IF it hits $9—it’s WHEN. Key flip: $3.09 becomes support and then its go time.” The failure scenario is simpler and more immediate. If XRP cannot secure closes above $2.30, the fan-and-range framework remains intact: rallies are still just rallies into the same ceiling, and the market risks reverting back towards $1.78. However, a dip towards this price would not change anything about the long-term bullish chart of XRP. Pointing to a gap between chart structure and crowd sentiment, Hughes wrote: “An actual infant in diapers and a 120-year-old grandpa who’s forgotten his own name can look at this chart and go, ‘Yep, classic breakout above the 2021 top, now flipping it to rock-solid support.’ Meanwhile, every bear on X, their mailman, their mailman’s dog walker, and that one guy who still thinks it’s 2022 are out here screaming ‘BEARISH! DOOM! SELL YOUR KIDS!’ like it’s still the bear market special. Bro, even my grandma’s bingo partner is bullish at this point. Wake up and smell the bull fuel.” At press time, XRP traded at $1.9799.

    "body": "Michael Saylor’s hint about a “Bigger Orange” has sent fresh energy through parts of the Bitcoin market. It came after Strategy executed a very large buy, and traders took the message as a sign there may be more accumulation ahead. Short bursts of buying have a way of changing tone on trading floors. Related Reading: What’s Driving The $1.42 Billion Comeback In Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Saylor Signals New Buying Spree According to reports, Strategy purchased more than $1.25 billion in Bitcoin in its latest move, adding thousands of coins to its holdings. That stack has pushed the company closer to a massive total that some sources put near 700,000 BTC. Markets reacted quickly. Prices nudged higher in the hours after the news, and shares of Strategy were treated by some investors as a way to get extra Bitcoin exposure. Traders Pounced And Charts Reacted Momentum traders were the first to lean in. They saw the buy as proof that a major corporate buyer still sees value in stacking coins during dips. Options desks showed increased call buying, and volume spiked on spot desks in New York and Asia. Sentiment grew more positive, but caution remained. Big buys can lift short-term prices, yet they don’t always start long, steady rallies. ₿igger Orange. pic.twitter.com/HI47hMCnui — Michael Saylor (@saylor) January 18, 2026 Market Reaction And Investor Moves Retail and institutional players both turned their attention to liquidity. Reports note that when one large buyer moves, other firms often reassess their risk and allocation plans. Hedge funds checked their models. Family offices ran fresh numbers. For some investors, the appeal is simple: owning a scarce asset that an influential buyer keeps adding to can feel reassuring. Corporate Treasuries And Public Perception Corporate cash strategies have been in the spotlight since Strategy first started buying coins. CEOs and boards watch those moves closely, and investors watch boards. For a public company to keep buying, confidence has to be high enough to risk press questions and regulatory attention. That choice is being watched by analysts who say such buys shape public debate about Bitcoin’s role as part of a company’s balance sheet. What Analysts Are Watching Analysts are tracking three things: how many coins are being taken off exchanges, whether accumulation is steady or one-off, and how the market digests more large purchases. On-chain trackers showed notable withdrawals after the reported purchase, which can tighten available supply. Some onlookers cautioned that short-term price jumps can be reversed if selling follows or if macro news turns sour. Related Reading: More XRP Than Cash? “You’re A Genius”, Analyst Says A Cautious Ending Note Based on market chatter, the “Bigger Orange” tease is more than a bit of bravado — it is treated as a strategic signal by many market players. Still, outcomes are far from certain. Buying by a major corporate holder can shift sentiment and squeeze short positions, but markets are shaped by many forces at once. For now, traders, investors, and watchers will keep an eye on any follow-up moves and how price and liquidity respond in the next sessions. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "XRP Price Could Surge Another 30% If This Trend Is Confirmed",
    "body": "Crypto analyst ChartNerd has raised the possibility of the XRP price recording another 30% surge from its current level. This comes even as the altcoin risks erasing its year-to-date (YTD) gains due to the recent crypto market crash. How The XRP Price Could Rally To $2.70 In an X post, ChartNerd stated that a potential XRP price rally to $2.70 is a possibility in the near term if the altcoin can hold the Fib support targets and mark a higher low. He highlighted three Fib support levels, including the 0.5 at $2, 0.618 at $1.99, and 0.786 at $1.89. He noted that the $2.70 was the base of the descending triangle, around the area where XRP broke down from following the October 10 crypto crash last year. Related Reading: XRP Wave C Push On The Way: What Could Send Price Below $2? ChartNerd also explained that the XRP price was currently in a falling wedge breakout pattern and that this typically leads to rallies as high as where the coin had broken down. As such, in this case, XRP could reach the descending triangle resistance at $2.70. The crypto analyst had also highlighted bullish fundamentals that could drive the rally toward this target. This includes Ripple’s alleged ties to South Korea’s tokenized infrastructure and projected major expansion for XRP. However, it is worth mentioning that the XRP price is also at risk of a further decline amid the latest crypto market crash, led by Bitcoin. BTC has dropped to as low as $92,000 in the last 24 hours, forcing XRP to crash below the psychological $2 level. This crash has occurred on the back of the latest Trump tariffs on some European nations over the U.S. proposed takeover of Greenland. The EU is weighing retaliatory tariffs, which could escalate this into another full-blown trade war. The Crash Could Be A “Blessing In Disguise” In another X post, ChartNerd suggested that the recent XRP price crash could be a blessing in disguise. This came as the analyst alluded to the $1.80 liquidity pocket on the monthly heatmap. He noted that this latest drawdown has swept the altcoin into that exact sell-side liquidity, a move which ChartNerd described as a clarity response. ChartNerd also suggested that the XRP price is likely a minor setback rather than a major retracement. He noted that although altcoins are taking hefty hits, Bitcoin hasn’t lost any key structure and that all he sees is “opportunity” until the trendline is invalidated. As such, XRP could see a bounce if BTC successfully defends this trendline.

    "title": "3-Wave Correction Sets XRP Price On Bearish Course – Another Major Crash Is Coming",
    "body": "XRP’s price action in recent days has taken a softer turn, with the token now trading below $2 after failing to hold recent recovery attempts. That move has changed the near-term momentum back in favor of sellers, especially as price action is printing closes beneath short-term dynamic support on the higher timeframes. A technical analysis shared by CoinsKid on X looks at a broader corrective structure developing on the 5-day chart, one that could place XRP on a more pronounced bearish path if important price levels are not reclaimed. 3-Wave Correction: Structure And Significance Technical analysis of XRP’s price action since mid-2025 shows an interesting corrective sequence that can be described in terms of waves. According to CoinsKid, what appeared to start as a corrective advance into the cluster of moving averages on the 5-day chart has failed to sustain itself once meeting resistance at the marked sell signal, which is shown in the chart image below. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Near-Identical Fractal Before The 2021 Bull Run Started According to CoinsKid’s interpretation of the 5-day candlestick chart, XRP price action appears to be tracing out a three-wave corrective move. The significance of this interpretation lies in its implication that the most recent bounce to $2.4 was not a true shift back to bullish control but a retracement within a larger downward corrective pattern that still has more moves to play out. An important point in the analysis is the loss of a custom indicator called the CoinsKid ribbon on the 5-day timeframe. This band of moving averages had previously acted as a guide for trend strength for most of 2025, with sustained trading above it pointing to bullish control. However, XRP has repeatedly closed below this ribbon since the flash crash in October 2025, and sellers have maintained control of the broader structure since then. XRP Price Chart. Source: @Coins_Kid on X Multi-Year Trendline As Downside Magnet The bearish scenario outlined on the chart places XRP’s next major area of interest around the rising multi-year support trendline, which currently converges in the $1.30 to $1.40 range. This ascending white trendline, which is visible on the 5-day chart and extends back to 2020, coincides with zones where XRP found strong demand after pullbacks. The highlighted green zone on the chart centers on this $1.30 to $1.40 range. Related Reading: PEPE Price Could Soar 3,000% If The Bottom Is In; Analyst Explains At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $1.96, down by 4.7% in the past 24 hours. CoinsKid’s projection is that if the current corrective move continues to play out, the XRP price could rotate lower from the descending resistance line and travel toward this support area over the coming months. This would be the final move in an ABC wave correction that began after XRP peaked at a new all-time high of $3.65 in July 2025. According to the analysis, only a sustained move back above the 5-day ribbon would invalidate this bearish path and reduce the likelihood of price revisiting that lower support region.

    "title": "Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Down Today? Key Drivers Behind The Move",
    "body": "Bitcoin slid to $91,920 late Sunday in New York, down 3.8% from roughly $95,500, as a sharp risk-off impulse hit crypto markets and quickly bled into high beta majors. Ether fell as much as 5.3% to $3,177, while XRP and Solana underperformed with drawdowns of 10.4% to $1.847 and 9% to $130, respectively, as leveraged positioning was forced out. Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Down Today? The immediate catalyst was a geopolitics-to-trade headline that landed into a weekend liquidity window: President Donald Trump said the US would impose additional 10% tariffs on imports from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland starting Feb. 1, escalating to 25% on June 1 unless a deal is reached for the US to acquire Greenland. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long Signal That Preceded 370% Move Is About To Go Off Again — What To Know European officials framed the move as coercive and signaled a coordinated response. Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel called the threat “blackmail,” adding: “It’s not necessary. It doesn’t help the alliance (NATO).” The targeted countries, many of them NATO allies, issued a stark pushback warning that tariff threats “undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,” while EU representatives convened emergency talks over potential retaliation. France’s President Macron threatened EU’s “anti-coercion instrument.” BREAKING: France’s President Macron calls for the EU to activate its “most potent trade weapon” against the US after President Trump’s tariff threat over Greenland.

When macro traders de-risk into headlines like this, liquid markets tend to transmit the shock first and crypto, with its 24/7 structure and deep derivatives footprint, often becomes the pressure valve. On-chain and venue-level indicators suggested the sell pressure was not simply offshore flow. CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet pointed to an elevated “CPG” (Coinbase Premium Gap), a metric tracking the price differential between Coinbase’s USD market and Binance’s USDT market that is often read as a proxy for US-led demand or supply. “We’re seeing the strongest selling premium (CPG) in recent periods. Since the ETF market was not open at the time, this selling pressure is coming from US whales operating outside of ETFs. It’s one of the traditional selling patterns we’ve seen repeatedly in the past,” Mignolet wrote in a CryptoQuant note. That framing matters because it implies the move wasn’t driven by ETF creations/redemptions, so the marginal seller was active in spot/OTC and derivatives channels that remain open through the weekend.

    "title": "Ethereum’s 4-Hour Chart Says A Big Dump Is Coming, Here’s The Target",
    "body": "The Ethereum (ETH) 4-hour chart is flashing warning signs as price hovers around a critical support zone. After months of sideways trading, ETH remains trapped in a consolidation, signaling weakening momentum amid uncertain broader market conditions. According to a crypto analyst, ETH’s 4-hour chart suggests that the cryptocurrency could be heading for a major price dump if buyers fail to regain control. Ethereum Price Chart Signals Major Crash Ahead A new market analysis by crypto expert Tyrex draws attention to a 4-hour chart, warning that ETH may be preparing for another price crash. Tyrex noted that Ethereum recently bottomed inside the purple rectangle on the lower timeframe, where price dipped below a key support around $3,260, briefly triggering a liquidity sweep. The move, however, was quickly reversed, indicating it was a fakeout rather than a true bearish breakdown. Related Reading: The Ethereum MACD Crossover That Could Lead To A Massive Bull Wave Even after the rejection, the analyst revealed that Ethereum’s broader 4-hour pattern remains largely unchanged. He stated that ETH has also repeatedly returned to the same support area, raising concerns that demand may be weakening. Notably, when price keeps revisiting the same lows, it often signals growing pressure, not strength. On the chart, Ethereum is now consolidating just above the highlighted support zone. Momentum has slowed compared to the earlier impulsive rally, and the price is still struggling to gain upward traction. Instead of continuation, the market appears to be hesitating at a critical area. According to Tyrex, this hesitation could be a major risk. Repeatedly retesting the same lows makes the market more vulnerable, increasing the likelihood of a deeper price dump. Notably, each retest makes it easier for sellers to break through support as buyers gradually lose control. The analyst’s chart also outlines a potential path lower if support gives way. A drop beneath the purple zone would put Ethereum at risk of sliding toward the next downside area between $3,209 and $3,221. At the time of Tyrex’s analysis, ETH was trading around $3,312, which means a move to this range would have represented a roughly 3% decline. However, as of writing, Ethereum has dropped to $3,200–which is already below the analyst’s initial breakdown target. This suggests that upward momentum has weakened further, and the recent price drop could signal an even larger decline, according to Tyrex’s analysis. Analyst Recommends A “Wait And See” Approach While the Ethereum price navigates bearish trends, Tyrex has advised investors and targets to adopt a wait-and-see approach. He indicated that ETH’s outlook is not entirely bearish. According to him, if Ethereum can hold above $3,230, it would shift his bearish bias to a cautiously bullish one. Related Reading: Ethereum Chart Turns Bullish: New Cycle Energy Points To $5,000 Maintaining that level suggests buyers are defending the range and preventing further downside. In that scenario, ETH could stabilize and potentially climb toward $3,420, as highlighted by the green zone on the chart. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

The primary reason, he said, is not the initial loss of funds, but the “breakdown of operations and trust during the response.” How Teams Respond Can Decide Fate Reports note that incident plans are rare and that the absence of a clear playbook hurts more than the bug itself. A quick, honest update can calm people. A slow, confused reaction makes things worse. In many cases, even after the technical flaw is fixed, the project stays damaged because users left and did not return. Some teams are rebuilt under new names. Others never regain attention. The human side of recovery matters a lot. Amador said many protocols freeze once an exploit comes to light. According to him, teams often underestimate how exposed they are and lack the operational readiness needed to handle a serious security breach. Security Problems Are Changing The attacks are not all the same. Smart contract bugs remain a big cause. But now simple human errors, like leaked keys or social tricks, are also common. Reports say that losses in recent years have grown into the billions, with one figure around $3.4 billion lost in a single year. That number shows the scale of the risk. Community Reaction Shapes Outcomes A project can be technically repaired. But the people who used it may have moved on. Communities are fragile. Some founders try to refund users or set up funds to cover losses. That can help. Other teams decide to close down the service and focus on other work. The decision is sometimes made for them when liquidity vanishes and partners cut ties. Recovery is often not just a technical task; it is a rebuild of trust and reputation. Data from Chainalysis shows the $1.4 billion Bybit hack accounted for almost half of crypto losses in 2025. Related Reading: What’s Driving The $1.42 Billion Comeback In Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Huge Damage Crypto hacks jumped sharply in 2025 as attackers hit both large platforms and private wallets. Based on reports, total losses reached $3.4 billion, the biggest annual figure since 2022. Just three breaches were responsible for nearly 70% of that damage by early December, with the $1.4 billion Bybit exploit standing out as the largest.

    "title": "Bitcoin Transitions Into A Higher Volatility Regime After Prolonged Compression: See How",
    "body": "After weeks of unusually tight price action, Bitcoin is set to break free from its prolonged volatility compression. With price now expanding beyond its narrow range, liquidation activity is increasing, and stronger reactions to macro and on-chain catalysts are renewing momentum. This shift suggests that BTC is entering a phase where wider daily ranges and heightened market participation are likely to dominate the near-term structure. What This Volatility Expansion Means For The Next Major Trend Bitcoin has officially entered a new volatility regime, and a major change in market structure is driving the shift. Analyst AliceMia has revealed on X that, for the first time, options open interest has surpassed futures open interest, signaling that price action is no longer dominated primarily by leveraged speculation and liquidation cascades. In contrast, BTC is now being influenced more by hedging flows, dealer positioning, and volatility structures. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Key Support As Weekend Liquidity Sets In — $98,200 And $107,500 In Focus As a result, the price behavior is changing. Rather than clean, straight-line breakouts fueled by forced liquidations, the market is seeing more magnet-level reactions around major strike levels and expiries. BTC price is moving from a casino market to a structured market. This is usually what happens before the bigger and more sustained moves happen. Bitcoin continues to consolidate inside the weekend range, which often acts as engineered liquidity during the following week. Crypto trader Lennaert Snyder highlighted that the preferred scenario for long trades would be if BTC continues to range higher through Sunday and sweeps the weekend liquidity on Monday/Tuesday. According to Snyder, all eyes are on the US Open, and he will only prolong the sweep of the weekend liquidity if BTC breaks the structure by regaining the $95,820 high. Only after that structural break would long positions make sense, with the monthly high as the primary target. From there, a higher price is expected. On the downside, the $94,635 low is still the level that must hold. As long as the price is above that on the higher timeframes, the bullish structure remains intact. However, if BTC loses that level and trades back into the previous range, momentum is likely to flip bearish. In that case, after confirmation, a short setup could become valid. Trader Snyder concluded that, as for Ethereum, the plan remains unchanged from the previous one. Deviation Confirmation Could Trigger The 2026 Super Rally The Bitcoin weekly plan is unfolding exactly as expected. Trader Alienopstrading also stated that shorts remain the focus for now since the $110,000 to $120,000 zone. BTC’s price has entered a minor consolidation and will see a move akin to what the analyst mapped out earlier. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $100K: Why All Eyes Are On The Short-Term Holders Once the lows are swept and BTC confirms the deviation, we could finally witness the 2026 super rally that many have been anticipating. “Just like I give you the top, I also want to give you the bottom,” Alienopstrading noted.

    "body": "A significant short squeeze may be on the horizon for XRP investors, potentially serving as the main catalyst for a rally that could push prices beyond the all-time high of $3.90. Market analyst Bird made these predictions in a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), highlighting key observations from his analysis. Key Liquidity Zones For XRP Bird shared a chart that illustrates where leveraged positions—both long and short—are concentrated in the market. He explained that the colored bands on the chart indicate levels of liquidity, where the potential for forced buying or selling could occur due to stop-loss orders and liquidations. Related Reading: Why The Dogecoin Price Could Outperform Bitcoin Again The analysis of the altcoin’s daily chart heatmap categorizes liquidity into two distinct zones: red, signifying deep liquidity, and lighter colors indicating less liquidity. From his observations, Bird noted that price movements away from low liquidity areas tend to occur rapidly. He explained this process: when prices approach zones with significant stop-loss clusters, they often trigger large sell-offs, wiping out long positions. Price Targets $4.20 Following these movements, the price typically rotates back toward shorts, leading to additional liquidation events. Bird pointed out that on Sunday, a number of long XRP positions were liquidated. Related Reading: 4 In 5 Hacked Crypto Projects Don’t Bounce Back, Expert Says Now, he sees a dense liquidity pocket forming around the $4.20 mark, primarily from short XRP positions. This situation incentivizes market makers to drive prices toward this liquidity to close out those trades, rather than moving away from it. As a result, Bird expressed confidence that the current XRP price rally is far from over. He believes that a new all-time high is imminent, as the potential for a substantial short squeeze looms. At the time of writing, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency on the market was trading at $2, having briefly dropped to $1.84 earlier on Monday. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "$790 Million In Crypto Longs Decimated As Bitcoin Plunges To $93,000",
    "body": "Bitcoin and the altcoins have plummeted during the past day, leading to the liquidation of a large amount of crypto longs in derivatives markets. Crypto Sector Has Seen A Notable Amount Of Liquidations In The Last Day According to data from CoinGlass, the past day’s volatility in the crypto market has been accompanied by a swath of liquidations. The “liquidation” of a contract occurs when it accumulates losses of a certain degree and is forcibly shut down by the exchange. In the digital asset sector, volatility tends to be high, so a large number of liquidations take place on a regular basis. The last 24 hours involved one such volatile event, as the table below depicts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Take Profits: 41,800 BTC Sent To Exchanges In total, the crypto market has faced $874 million in liquidations within this window. Out of these, long contracts have made up for an overwhelming share: $788 million. The reason for liquidations being this lopsided naturally lies in the price action that has developed over the last day. Bitcoin saw a sudden drop from $95,500 to a low of $93,000, while Ethereum went from $3,350 to $3,200. In percentage terms, these drops aren’t too big, but the rapid nature of them is what triggered the liquidations. The source of the crash could lie in revitalized US-EU tariff tensions. As reported by Reuters, President Donald Trump vowed over the weekend to implement tariffs on eight European nations. Starting February 1st, goods from Denmark, Great Britain, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland will face an additional 10% import tariff. If the US isn’t allowed to acquire the Danish territory of Greenland, these tariffs will go up to 25% on June 1st. 2025 already saw several events where tariff-related uncertainty affected the crypto market, so it’s not surprising to see that the latest news has also been accompanied by volatility. As is usually the case, the latest market volatility has led to Bitcoin-related contracts occupying a disproportionate share of liquidations. As is visible in the above heatmap, Bitcoin has seen liquidations of around $233 million in the past day. Ethereum, the next-ranked coin in this category, has witnessed $156 million in contracts being involved. Related Reading: XRP In A ‘Super Cycle’? SuperTrend Suggests Another Story From the altcoins, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin have ranked the highest with $61 million, $41 million, and $35 million in liquidations, respectively. SOL being ahead of XRP despite being smaller in market cap may be because of its 6% plunge being larger than the latter’s 4% drop. Bitcoin Price Bitcoin has seen a slight rebound from its low as the cryptocurrency’s price is now back at $93,100. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Maintains Bullish Bias Above $1.30 Despite Recent Rejection",
    "body": "XRP continues to show underlying strength despite facing rejection near recent highs, with the broader structure remaining intact. As long as the price holds above the key $1.30 level, the bullish bias remains in play, signaling that the latest pullback may be a consolidation rather than the start of a deeper reversal. Multi-Year Breakout Holds As XRP Builds For The Next Expansion During a recent analysis, Crypto Patel highlighted that XRP is trading above a confirmed multi-year breakout zone on the higher-timeframe chart, following the completion of a prolonged accumulation phase. After delivering a powerful expansion move, price action now appears to be building a structure for the next potential leg higher. Related Reading: XRP Is Doing Something It Hasn’t Done Since 2021: Here’s Why It Matters From a technical perspective, XRP has already achieved a decisive breakout from a descending wedge that developed between 2020 and 2024. This breakout triggered a rally of more than 600% from the $0.60 level, reinforcing the strength of the broader bullish trend and confirming the shift in long-term market structure. Price is currently respecting a key fair value gap and accumulation zone between $1.90 and $1.30, an area that continues to act as a critical demand region. As long as XRP remains above $1.30, the higher-timeframe bullish structure stays intact, keeping the broader upside thesis firmly in play. Looking ahead, Crypto Patel maintains ambitious upside targets at $3.50, $5.00, $8.70, and potentially above $10 over the longer term. The bullish outlook would be invalidated only by a higher-timeframe close below the $1.30 level, which would signal a breakdown in structure and shift the bias. Trendline Structure Holds Despite Rejection Near $2.37 In another XRP update, Umair Crypto noted that the broader trendline structure remains intact despite the recent push above a key psychological level and rejection near $2.37. While momentum indicators showed early weakness, the price reaction did not result in a confirmed breakdown of the overall structure. Related Reading: XRP Price Is Approaching A Key Decision Zone, But Structure Is Still Firmly Bullish According to the analysis, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) broke down ahead of price, followed by XRP losing the range Point of Control (POC). This sequence triggered a sharp pullback, but importantly, the move lacked clear structural failure, suggesting the decline was corrective rather than trend-ending. Relative strength continues to stand out. During the ETH-led market flush, XRP experienced a sell-off but rebounded quickly, outperforming many ETH beta assets. This behavior suggests capital rotation into relative strength rather than a broad-based distribution across the market. Looking ahead, the bias remains constructive as long as the trendline holds and the price can reclaim value above the range POC. However, sustained acceptance below this area would invalidate the bullish setup and shift the focus toward lower levels. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "XRP Longs Get Wiped: Binance Leads $5M Liquidation Wave",
    "body": "XRP is attempting to reclaim the $2 mark after a sharp breakdown that briefly dragged the price toward the $1.85 level. While bulls are trying to stabilize the move, the broader market remains under pressure as macroeconomic uncertainty rises and analysts continue to warn that crypto could be entering a deeper bear market phase. In this environment, volatility is being amplified by leverage, and XRP’s derivatives market has become a clear battleground. Related Reading: Monero Triggers Retail Alert That Preceded ZEC And DASH Drops As Privacy Coin Hype Returns A CryptoQuant report highlights how January 18 delivered one of the most painful sessions for leveraged XRP traders this month. Data from the XRP Exchange Liquidation Metrics shows a major wave of forced liquidations hitting long positions across major exchanges, signaling that many traders were positioned too aggressively into the downside move. Unlike trading volume or open interest, liquidation data reflects positions being closed involuntarily, meaning traders were wiped out rather than choosing to exit. Total long liquidations reportedly exceeded $5 million on the day, marking a standout liquidation cluster for January. Binance played a dominant role in the flush, accounting for roughly $1.05 million in long liquidations, reinforcing its position as a key venue driving XRP’s short-term volatility. Macro Headlines Triggered the XRP Leverage Flush The CryptoQuant report suggests that XRP’s liquidation spike on January 18 was not purely technical, but part of a broader macro-driven risk-off move that hit the entire crypto market at once. Instead of a slow bleed, the sell-off looked like a synchronized shock, where traders across multiple assets were forced to reduce exposure as uncertainty surged in global markets. According to the report, the trigger came from geopolitical and trade-war rhetoric. Financial Times reported that European capitals may respond to US pressure over Greenland by considering tariffs worth up to €93 billion ($107.7B), or even restricting US companies’ access to the EU market. Even without immediate policy action, the headline alone was enough to revive fears of renewed transatlantic escalation. Related Reading: XRP Whale Inflows To Binance Hit Their Lowest Level Since 2021: Accumulation Behavior? Markets typically treat these events as liquidity threats. When tariffs and retaliation enter the narrative, traders begin pricing in slower growth, tighter financial conditions, and more volatility. Crypto, still behaving as a high-beta risk asset, tends to react fast. Bitcoin’s drop from above $95,000 to below $93,000 added fuel to the fire, reinforcing downside momentum across altcoins. In XRP, that pressure quickly turned into forced selling, as leveraged longs were liquidated into a falling market rather than exiting voluntarily. XRP Struggles Below $2 After Sharp Rejection XRP is attempting to stabilize after a violent downswing that pulled the price back into the $1.85–$2.00 zone. The daily chart shows a clear rejection from the recent rebound high near $2.40, followed by an aggressive selloff that erased most of the breakout attempt. XRP is now trading around $1.97, hovering just below the psychological $2 level. Which has turned into a short-term momentum pivot. From a market structure perspective, the trend remains pressured. Price continues to trade under the major moving averages, with the faster average rolling over and acting as dynamic resistance. The mid-term curve is also sloping downward, reinforcing the idea that rallies are still being sold rather than held. This aligns with a broader pattern of lower highs since the October peak. Suggesting that the market is still in a corrective phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Score Hits Level Seen Only 7 Times In 6 Years – A Rare Historical Signal The wick structure and repeated failed pushes toward the $2.20–$2.40 region show sellers defending that supply zone aggressively. At the same time, buyers are taking action near $1.85, forming a visible demand floor that has held through recent volatility. For bulls, reclaiming $2.10–$2.20 is the first step toward recovery. Otherwise, another breakdown toward $1.85 remains a valid risk.",
