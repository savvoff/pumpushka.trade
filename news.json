    "title": "Crypto Carnage Continues — Tom Lee Exposes What’s Really Going On",
    "body": "The global crypto market pulled back to about $3.23 trillion on Monday, down close to a percent from recent levels, and signs of weakness were visible across most top tokens. Related Reading: From Dotcom To Crypto: Veteran Analyst Says The Bull Run Isn’t Over According to market trackers, investor mood is chilled — the Fear and Greed Index sits at 18, labeled extreme fear — and the average Relative Strength Index for major coins hovers near 41, a reading that leans toward oversold conditions. Bitcoin was trading around $95,400 while Ethereum hovered near $3,155, with many large-cap assets showing only small daily moves. Tom Lee Issues Long-Term Take According to Tom Lee, BitMine chairman and an early Bitcoin bull at Fundstrat, the current pullback does not wipe out the potential for much larger gains down the road. Lee noted that Bitcoin rose roughly 100x from his first recommendation back in 2017, when the price was near $1,000, and he suggested Ethereum may be at the start of a similar long-term run. BitMine Chairman Tom Lee suggested that the recent crypto market weakness may be due to one or more market makers having a “hole” in their balance sheets, with “sharks” circling to trigger liquidations and push BTC lower. He emphasized that this is short-term pain and does not… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 16, 2025 He cautioned that investors who benefited from past rallies had to endure extreme drops — some as deep as 75% — and said present volatility could be the market “discounting a massive future.” Short-Term Signals Point To Oversold Conditions Market technicians and on-chain analysts are pointing to clear short-term stress. The Fear and Greed Index at 18 is one headline figure. Average RSI readings near 41 imply more selling than buying momentum right now. To me, the weakness in crypto has the all the signs – of a market maker (or two) with a major “hole” in their balance sheet Sharks circling to trigger a liquidation / dumping of prices $BTC Is this pain short-term? Yes Does this change the $ETH supercycle of Wall Street… pic.twitter.com/0jfkXYnfv9 — Thomas (Tom) Lee (not drummer) FSInsight.com (@fundstrat) November 15, 2025 Based on reports from CryptoQuant, Ether trading around $3,150 sits roughly $200 above the mean cost basis held by long-term accumulators — a level that could act as support if those holders remain patient. Bitcoin, by comparison, has pulled back about 20% from its recent peak, while Ethereum has fallen more than 30% from its high. Bitcoin is a volatile asset. We first recommended Bitcoin to Fundstrat clients in 2017 (1%-2% allocation) – Bitcoin 2017 ~$1,000 Since then (past 8.5 years), $BTC: – 6 declines > -50% – 3 declines > – 75% 2025, Bitcoin 100x from our first recommendation TAKEAWAY: To have… pic.twitter.com/xtIRGLdnWM — Thomas (Tom) Lee (not drummer) FSInsight.com (@fundstrat) November 16, 2025 Ether Holder Levels Close To Historic Peaks Ethereum’s path this year diverged from Bitcoin for a while: ETH topped out at $4,940 in August, while Bitcoin pushed to a peak above $126,000 in October. That gap left Ether lagging for months even as Bitcoin made fresh highs. Now, with ETH nearer to where long-term holders bought in, some analysts see a potential floor forming. Reports have disclosed that these accumulators have been “patiently stacking,” and their cost positions matter for near-term price action. Altcoins Show Little Momentum Smaller large-cap coins are holding weaker ground. XRP was trading near $2.20, BNB around $932 and Solana close to $138, with most of last week’s gains fading. Other popular tokens — Tron, Dogecoin, Cardano, Chainlink, Hyperliquid and Zcash — are under light selling pressure and low net movement, suggesting market-wide caution rather than a single-asset sell-off.

Bigger Players, Liquidations And The Outlook Lee added that he expects signs of recovery and stability within six to eight weeks. He advised against using borrowed funds now, warning that forced sell-offs can accelerate losses. According to his remarks, aggressive positions designed to trigger liquidations by large firms can amplify price swings. He cautioned that some of the sharper moves may be tied to stress among big market makers. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "BlackRock XRP ETF Speculation Hit New Highs As XRPC Performance Shocks Markets",
    "body": "The speculation surrounding a potential BlackRock XRP ETF has surged to new heights. This surge is a direct consequence of the astonishing market debut of the Canary XRPC ETF. Canary XRP ETF’s launch has painted a clear picture of robust institutional and retail demand for a regulated XRP investment product. Why XRPC’s Success Fuels BlackRock Rumors As the speculation around a potential BlackRock XRP ETF is heating up again, the Canary XRPC ETF has delivered one of the strongest launches of the year. An analyst known as Skipper_xrp has noted on X that the newly listed fund stunned the market with over $58 million in first-day trading volume and $245 million in net inflows, outperforming hundreds of ETF debuts of 2025. Related Reading: XRP ETF Completes First Full Day Of Trading, Here’s Why The Community Is Shocked Skipper_xrp mentioned that many supporters in the XRP community still believe that BlackRock might already be quietly experimenting with or even testing the idea of an XRP trust behind closed doors. The momentum has increased further after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse made a statement at the company’s Swell event, highlighting that Ripple’s ongoing collaboration with major traditional financial firms will bring digital asset adoption into regulated global markets. However, with the ETF inflows accelerating and XRP gaining more visibility among institutions, many investors are now arguing that it’s only a matter of time before a heavyweight firm like BlackRock will consider stepping into the XRP space. Understanding XRP’s Long-Term Growth Trajectory Crypto trader Adam_Xrp has also offered some insight on why XRP didn’t moon when the first ETF was launched. According to the expert, the XRP ETF launch was never going to be a flip-the-switch moment. Even with the first XRP ETF going live, price action was building slowly, and the institutional money did not pour in all at once. Rather, it scales over time as confidence and liquidity grow. Related Reading: New XRP ETF Just Dropped, But Will Anything Be Different This Time? Furthermore, the altcoin is still early in the rollout, and more XRP ETFs are scheduled to begin trading. Each new product will increase exposure, volume, and demand. This is how true institutional adoption is slowly progressing. BlackRock has stated that the company is not launching an XRP ETF right now, but this isn’t something they would ignore forever. However, once the regulatory path is fully cleared and institutional demand strengthens, it’s only a matter of time before the biggest players, like BlackRock, will step into the arena. Adam_Xrp concluded that the altcoin wasn’t supposed to skyrocket overnight. This phase is a gradual process of foundation building as the ecosystem, liquidity expansion, and the institutional framework grow. The expert added that if you expect to get rich overnight, without understanding the long-term game plan, then XRP might not be the right investment for you.

    "title": "The ‘Insanely Bullish’ Dogecoin Setup That Will Trigger A 600% Rally To $1",
    "body": "Dogecoin has spent the past few days struggling to regain momentum after a series of pullbacks dragged the price back toward the mid-$0.16 region. The broader market has also been unstable, adding pressure to Dogecoin. Despite this stretch of bearish price action, a deeper look at the higher-timeframe chart shows a structure that has not been invalidated by the recent decline. This is where a technical analysis from XForceGlobal comes in, as he argues that Dogecoin is sitting inside an “insanely bullish” long-term formation that is unfolding beneath the surface. The 5-Wave Structure Behind Dogecoin’s Bullish Setup A detailed technical analysis shared by XForceGlobal on the social media platform X argues that Dogecoin is nearing the final stages of an Elliott Wave formation. His interpretation points to cycle targets well above $1 and frames the ongoing price action as part of a developing fifth impulse wave. Related Reading: Top Meme Coins Besides Dogecoin And Shiba Inu With Potential Still Seeing Major Interest The chart shared by XForceGlobal outlines an idealized Elliott Wave cycle that stretches back almost a decade. Dogecoin has already completed the first four major waves on the macro level. The technical analysis shows the fifth wave technically began months ago, with the fourth wave bottom forming sometime between late 2023 and early 2024. However, the prolonged pullbacks of the past few months introduce the possibility that the fourth wave may still be playing out, instead of the fifth wave. Despite the choppy price action, the analysis shows that the fourth wave low is protected, and the current price action is still the fifth wave. The chart also shows how Dogecoin has been distributing within a narrowing structure, but the lows have consistently held. Both of the scenarios visualized on Dogecoin’s price chart still lead to a new all-time high once the rally resumes for another strong push. Why The Next Dogecoin Wave Points Toward $1 XForceGlobal noted that “cycle targets are still $1+,” a projection supported by the geometry of the fifth wave. The structure resembles the same formations that highlighted Dogecoin’s massive expansions in earlier bull cycles, particularly in 2017 and 2021. Nonetheless, it’s important to note that there’s still room for more distribution. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Price “Historic Mega Run” – Here’s The Target The current resistance zones sit far below his projected fifth-wave target zone, and the broader market structure shows no violation of the wave-4 levels that must hold for the setup to still be valid. The chart highlights a potential path that first moves through the $0.33-$0.47 zone before clearing the psychological $0.50 threshold and finally breaking above its current all-time highs at $0.731 and further up into the $1 region. A full extension of the fifth wave from present levels implies a price target around $1.768. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1618.

    "title": "Ethereum Flashes Rare Oversold Signal As Price Hits Demand Zone — Major Rebound Loading?",
    "body": "Ethereum (ETH) is flashing a rare technical warning sign for bears. According to the analysis, the daily chart has hit a historically oversold MACD reading not seen in years, aligning with a deeply oversold RSI. This confluence of extreme momentum signals suggests that the price has entered a major demand zone, dramatically increasing the likelihood of a powerful relief rally and setting the stage for a significant short-term rebound. MACD Hits Rare Historical Lows — A Zone Linked To Major ETH Bottoms According to a recent post from More Crypto Online, Ethereum is currently flashing one of its most extreme MACD readings seen in years on the daily timeframe. While the MACD technically has no fixed oversold threshold, comparing past cycles gives valuable context. Historically, ETH has often formed significant market bottoms whenever the MACD enters the -210 to -220 region, a zone it has dipped below a few times, but not often. Related Reading: Ethereum Slips to $3K, Highlighting Weakness After Recent Failed Rebound This puts the current MACD position into what can be considered a historically oversold zone, signaling increased potential for a relief bounce. Adding to this confluence, the RSI has also slipped deep into oversold territory, reinforcing the idea that sell pressure may be nearing exhaustion. Together, both indicators suggest that momentum could soon shift away from the bears. However, the analyst cautions that these signals alone do not confirm a major trend reversal. Oversold conditions can persist longer than expected, particularly in strong downtrends. Even so, such extreme readings are often early clues that a temporary recovery or a corrective move to the upside may be approaching. Overall, the current market structure gives the bears something to think about. Early Signs Of Relief: Ethereum Finds Stability In Key Demand Zone In a 3D market update, CryptoPulse reported that Ethereum has now cleanly tapped the identified Demand Zone, showing early signs that the aggressive downside may be easing. This reaction suggests sellers are losing momentum, creating the conditions for a potential short-term rebound if buyers step back in. Should bullish strength return, a retest of the $3,500 region is likely in the coming sessions. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Critical Resistance — Bullish Breakout Or Trap In The Making? However, CryptoPulse emphasized that confirmation is still required before calling any meaningful reversal. A strong bounce paired with a reclaim of key short-term levels would be the first signal that buyers are regaining control. Meanwhile, if bearish pressure persists, Ethereum may drift deeper into the chart structure, where the next significant demand sits between $2,400 and $2,600. This zone could act as the major support zone for ETH if the current support fails to hold. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "One Slip And Dogecoin Could Plunge Back Into A Bear Market: Analyst",
    "body": "The Dogecoin multi-year recovery trend is under pressure as price slips below a key ascending support and rests on an historic horizontal level, according to a new chart from trader and analyst Rekt Capital. Dogecoin Is Inches Away From A Bear Market In an X post, Rekt Capital shared a 1-month DOGE/USDT chart from Binance, created on TradingView on Nov. 15, and warned: “Dogecoin needs to protect its multi-year technical uptrend heading into December to keep chances for macro upside alive.” The chart tracks Dogecoin from the 2021 blow-off top through the 2022–2023 bear market and the subsequent recovery. A rising trendline, built from the bear-market lows, currently runs just below the $0.18 region and has defined what Rekt Capital calls DOGE’s “multi-year technical uptrend.” The latest monthly candle, however, shows Dogecoin trading around $0.16355, beneath that trendline and pressed against a horizontal support level near $0.159. That horizontal area is not arbitrary. On the monthly timeframe it has repeatedly flipped role between resistance and support over the last two years. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Bounce Very Quickly If This Happens At $0.166 From May to October 2024, the ~$0.159–0.16 band acted as a ceiling, repeatedly rejecting upside attempts. The eventual breakout above this level in October 2024 preceded an explosive move: Dogecoin’s price nearly tripled from roughly $0.16 to a December high of $0.4843. In 2025, the same zone then became crucial support. Between March and July, monthly candles showed downside wicks piercing below intramonth, but closes repeatedly held above the level, confirming it as a major structural floor. What To Watch Now That history is what makes the current retest so significant. With roughly half the month remaining, the red November candle has already lost the rising trendline near $0.18 and is now depending on the long-standing $0.159–0.16 horizontal area to arrest further downside. On a monthly chart, what matters is not just the intramonth excursion but where the candle closes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Shows Relative Strength: Breakout Signal Sits At This Price If DOGE can reclaim and close back above the trendline, the pattern of higher lows that has defined the multi-year uptrend would remain largely intact. A monthly close decisively below the horizontal level, by contrast, would mean both the ascending support and this historically pivotal price floor have failed, materially weakening the macro bullish structure. For now, Dogecoin sits exactly on that line in the sand. As Rekt Capital put it, DOGE “needs to protect its multi-year technical uptrend heading into December” if it is to avoid sliding back toward a bear-market profile. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1626. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin SSR Flashes Buy Signal: Rebound Incoming?",
    "body": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Stablecoin Supply Ratio has declined into the buy territory. Here’s what followed this signal in the past. Bitcoin SSR RSI Is Giving A Buy Signal In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) for Bitcoin. The SSR is an indicator that measures how the market cap of BTC compares against the total supply of the stablecoins. Stablecoins refer to cryptocurrencies that are pegged to a fiat currency. Investors generally park their capital in the form of these assets when they want to avoid the volatility associated with BTC and other assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Social Dominance Hits 4-Month High: What It Means Such holders also usually eventually invest back into Bitcoin and company, however, exchanging away their stablecoins in favor of them once they feel the time is right. Because of this reason, the stablecoin supply is often looked at as a sort of “available buy supply” in the cryptocurrency sector. When the value of SSR is high, it means BTC’s value is high compared to the stablecoin supply. Such a trend suggests the market stablecoin buying power is low, which could be a bearish sign. On the other hand, the indicator being low implies the sector may have a high amount of dry powder available relative to the Bitcoin market cap, which can naturally be bullish. Now, here is the chart for the BTC SSR shared by the analyst that shows the trend in its Relative Strength Index (RSI) over the last couple of years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin SSR RSI has witnessed a decline recently as the BTC spot price has crashed. This suggests that there may be a high amount of stablecoin buying power available in the market now. The indicator’s drop has been so steep that it has entered into a zone that Maartunn has flagged as pertaining to a buy signal. From the chart, it’s apparent that past instances of this signal have often coincided with some sort of bottom or led into a price surge. In a lot of the instances, however, the signal has only resulted in a temporary reversal. It now remains to be seen whether any bullish shift will follow the latest signal, and if one does, whether it will be lasting. Related Reading: Solana Air Gap: Analyst Says No Major Support Level Until $24 In some other news, a large movement involving dormant tokens has just occurred on the Bitcoin network, as Maartunn has pointed out in another X post. “4,668 $BTC aged 3–5 years were just spent — a clear spike in dormant supply activation,” noted the analyst. Movement from dormant hands is often a sign of selling. BTC Price Bearish momentum hasn’t shown any signs of stopping for Bitcoin as its price has now dropped to the $92,500 level.

    "title": "Bitcoin Price Alert: This Indicator Signals SELL, Could History Repeat With A 67% Drop?",
    "body": "The Bitcoin price has seen a significant pullback, retracing nearly 26% from its all-time highs, fueling speculation about the potential onset of a new bear market. Compounding this uncertainty, a fresh sell signal has emerged from one of the cryptocurrency’s key indicators, reminiscent of the past when similar signals led to a staggering 67% drop in value. Bitcoin Price Could Plunge To $31,000 Market expert Ali Martinez pointed out in a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that the last time the SuperTrend indicator issued a sell signal for Bitcoin was in 2022. At that time, Bitcoin, which had reached an all-time high of $69,000, subsequently fell to around $17,000. Related Reading: Can Strategy Survive A 90% Bitcoin Crash? Saylor Says Yes While the market landscape has changed significantly since then—with the introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), new digital asset treasuries (DATs), and increased institutional support spurred by pro-crypto regulations—the current situation mirrors some of those past concerns. As it stands, the Bitcoin price is trading just above $94,500. If the historical trend of a 67% retracement were to repeat in the next months, the price could potentially fall to around $31,185, which could be the potential bottom of the new bear market. Adding to the conversation, another analyst known as Mr. Wall Street suggested that the recent Bitcoin price peak might be at $126,000. He forecasted that the next major downward move could see BTC hit levels between $74,000 and $82,000, ultimately reaching a target between $54,000 and $60,000 by the fourth quarter of 2026. This perspective contributes to the notion that Bitcoin is likely confirmed in a bear market, which could result in a year-long decline marked by price fluctuations similar to those seen in previous bear cycles. A New Death Cross Emerges Further complicating the outlook, analyst Doctor Profit pointed out a significant technical signal: the Bitcoin price experienced a death cross for the first time since April 2025. This event, marked by the 50-day moving average (MA) crossing below the 200-day moving average, historically led to rallies of 25% to 60% in the following three months. However, Doctor Profit emphasized a crucial difference this time around: the death cross occurred while Bitcoin was trading 6% below the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA50). In the previous instances, such crosses happened while Bitcoin was positioned above the EMA50, suggesting a different market sentiment this time. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Ethereum Price Is Crashing Again, Can It Breach $3,000? The current bearish sentiment is intensified by negative trends in ETF sales and whale net volume, adding significant pressure to the Bitcoin price. With the average entry price for Bitcoin buyers over the past six months set at approximately $94,600, falling back toward or below this level could trigger fresh selling pressure. Historically, short-term traders tend to exit at breakeven or even at a slight loss, raising concerns about further declines. Doctor Profit concluded his analysis stating: This combination of ETF selling, whale selling, and a large cluster of sellers sitting at breakeven levels is a dangerous setup and adds to the bearish case.

The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.50. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.220 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.120 level. The next major support is near the $2.10 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.10 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.050. The next major support sits near the $2.020 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.880. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.120 and $2.050. Major Resistance Levels – $2.20 and $2.220.",

    "title": "Analyst Shares Worst-Case Scenario For Bitcoin (BTC) As Price Shows Concerning Signs",
    "body": "While Bitcoin (BTC) continues to lose crucial support levels, an analyst has shared three possible scenarios for the flagship crypto’s upcoming performance, raising the alarm about potential early signs of a bear market. Related Reading: Ripple Exec Addresses Tax Issue On XRP Ledger, Where Does It Go? Bitcoin Price Correction Continues On Monday, Bitcoin reached a new multi-month low after dropping below $93,000 for the first time since May. The cryptocurrency started the week dropping nearly 5% from the $96,000 area and retesting the $91,000 level as support. Notably, BTC has seen a 16% correction from its November opening and has lost multiple crucial levels over the past few weeks, including the $100,000 psychological barrier and the 21-Week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as support. Most recently, the flagship cryptocurrency closed the week below the 50-week EMA, which has raised the alarm for several market observers. Analyst Rekt Capital noted that losing this indicator is “not something we typically want to see if bullish Market Structure is to remain intact,” adding that “bear markets tend to confirm when price loses the key bullish levels that have supported upside momentum across the cycle.” He explained that Bitcoin has formed clusters of lower lows at the 50-Week EMA across the cycle, which have “helped sustain a broader bullish technical uptrend.” However, BTC is currently forming another cluster below this indicator, instead of approaching the possible macro lower high developing above the 50-Week EMA. As a result, BTC’s recent performance signals the first step of a potential breakdown, the analyst warned: A full breakdown unfolds in three parts: first, a Weekly Close below the key level; second, a post-breakdown relief rally that turns that level into new resistance; and third, downside continuation that completes the bearish confirmation. Early Signs Of A Bearish Trend? Rekt Capital stressed that the 50-week EMA will be crucial in determining whether BTC’s bullish trend and tendency for “benign downside deviations” still hold. He emphasized that if the flagship crypto fails to reclaim this indicator as support and it turns into a resistance, it could be transitioning from its downside deviation tendency to the early stages of a confirmed bearish trend. The analyst detailed that during the early bear markets, “a Weekly Close below the 50-Week EMA is followed by several weeks of post-breakdown relief rallies into that moving average, but those attempts ultimately fail, and the EMA simply acts as resistance until downside acceleration unfolds.” Based on this, he shared three potential outlooks for BTC’s performance. The best-case scenario for Bitcoin would be reclaiming this indicator and successfully ending this correction as a downside deviation, as it would suggest that BTC remains in a bull market. The second-best case scenario would be that Bitcoin sees a multi-week hesitation period below the EMA as it enters the bear market, which could include a brief overextension above this level before a clearer trend resolution to the downside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Just Flashed A Death Cross, But It’s Not What You Think Meanwhile, the worst-case scenario would see the cryptocurrency’s price unable to retest the 50-Week EMA, even as resistance, and directly enter the downside acceleration phase. Nonetheless, the analyst noted that, historically, the third scenario doesn’t appear as likely if we have already entered a bear market. Instead, he concluded that the recurring “relief-rally scenario” into the 50-week EMA before downside continuation seems more likely. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

Solana Price Dips Further Solana price failed to remain stable above $155 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL declined below the $150 and $140 support levels. The price gained bearish momentum below $138. A low was formed at $128, and the price is now consolidating losses. The price recovered a few points above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $143 swing high to the $128 low.

    "title": "Crypto Market Wipes Out $1 Trillion Since October: Analyzing The Forces Behind The Crash",
    "body": "Since October 6, the crypto market has lost over $1.1 trillion in value. Analysts from The Bull Theory examined the underlying causes of this behavior and identified significant issues causing such poor performance in what was expected to be a bullish fourth quarter for the industry. Market Liquidity Stumbles Post-October 10 Sell-Off One of the primary factors cited is the severe damage inflicted on market liquidity following the dramatic sell-off on October 10, which resulted in more than $20 billion liquidated from traders in a matter of minutes. This particularly impacted altcoins, with many seeing losses of 70% to 80%. With liquidity diminished, the current market environment allows prices to fluctuate easily, meaning even minor sell-offs can lead to rapid price drops. The analysts noted that the liquidity has failed to recover since this initial dump, resulting in the order books for major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) becoming increasingly sparse. Related Reading: The ‘Insanely Bullish’ Dogecoin Setup That Will Trigger A 600% Rally To $1 The consequences of this thin liquidity are stark; a small volume of selling can generate significant downward price movements. This observation matches the reality of recent market activity, where price declines appear more pronounced than the actual selling volume. Another contributing factor to the downturn, as pointed out by market analyst Tom Lee, is the behavior of major market makers. According to Lee, the ongoing correction may stem from one or two large entities facing considerable losses. Layered upon these issues is the excessive leverage in the market. Despite the unprecedented liquidations, many traders have reportedly returned to the market with increased leverage. The Bull Theory analysts contend that this high leverage, coupled with thin markets, enables market makers to trigger substantial liquidations with minimal price movement, making the sell-offs appear more aggressive. Crypto Fear Index Hits Lowest Level In Over 3 Years Compounding these issues, market sentiment has been plagued by fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). Current narratives circulating, such as speculation regarding Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) facing forced liquidations if Bitcoin falls below $74,000, further exacerbate panic. It is worth noting that during the 2020-2021 cycle, Strategy’s cost basis hovered around $30,000 to $32,000. Even when Bitcoin dipped to $16,000—almost 50% below their cost—the company did not sell any coins. The Fear Index has also plummeted to 10, a level not seen in over three and a half years. The analysts belive that such extreme fear suggests two potential scenarios: either the market has reached its bottom, or it is approaching it. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Ethereum Price Is Crashing Again, Can It Breach $3,000? In conjunction with these sentiment measures, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Bitcoin has returned to levels comparable to those of January 2023, when Bitcoin was valued around $20,000. The analysts suggest that this signals a stretched market on the downside, particularly within altcoins, where speculative activity has diminished and retail interest is waning. Despite the current turmoil, the Bull Theory analysts find that fundamentally, little has changed within the crypto market. They highlighted that Bitcoin’s network remains robust, with increasing hashrate, ongoing institutional interest, and a supportive stance from the US government regarding regulated crypto. However, it remains to be seen what the eventual direction of the digital asset market will be, as neither negative nor bullish cycles follow straight lines. This suggests that despite the downtrend, a new recovery and future dips may occur, and vice versa. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was leading Monday’s crypto market drop, trading at $91,940—a 3% drop within 24 hours and a 13% drop within a week.

    "title": "Dogecoin Cup And Handle Pattern Is Returning, What Happens To Price If It’s Completed?",
    "body": "A Dogecoin cup and handle pattern has returned to the chart, which could be pointing to another recovery trend. The chart pattern was highlighted by crypto analyst Melikatrader on a TradingView post, showing that there could be a reversal coming for Dogecoin soon. The analysis further explains how the formation came about and what this could mean for the meme coin’s price as another week of trading gets underway in the current bearish environment. Understand The Dogecoin Macro Cup And Handle Pattern Interestingly, the formation of the macro cup and handle pattern didn’t just start recently, as is usually the case. The crypto analyst explains that this formation had begun years ago, back in 2021, when the Dogecoin price had staged its legendary 36,000% rally that pushed it to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Analyst Breaks Down Why There Can’t Be 7 Million XRP Holders It comes after what was perhaps the strongest pole and flag rally in the Dogecoin price history, pushing it to new heights in the process. However, this led to the formation of a multi-year-long cup and handle pattern, with the cup portion of the pattern being in formation since 2021. This large cup formation points to long-term accumulation for the Dogecoin price. Now, according to the analyst, the cup has been completed, leaving the handle pattern that is now underway. As part of this, the Dogecoin price is now trading inside of a descending handle, and this is where the bullish part comes in. This is because a descending bullish handle has often appeared as a precursor to a bullish price breakout. Why DOGE Price Could Hit $4 With the formation of the handle pattern already starting, it now remains for the completion of the bullish trend. As long as the Dogecoin price is able to break out of the descending handle, then it would set the tone for the upward reversal for the meme coin. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Falling Because Of Strategy Sell-Offs? On-Chain Data Fuels Debate The major thing about this bullish handle is the fact that the breakout could last into multiple years. This multi-year expansion phase could see the continuous increase of the price as Dogecoin makes its way back toward its $0.74 all-time highs that were set back in 2021. However, this would not be the end of the uptrend, as the crypto analyst explains that the completion of the cup and handle pattern puts the price much higher. The target puts the lower and more conservative end at $2.8. But a 2,400% expansion is still possible, pushing the price as high as $4 before the trend is complete.

    "title": "Why Is Bitcoin Price Crashing? Arthur Hayes Isn’t Surprised",
    "body": "In his latest Substack essay “Snow Forecast,” published November 17, 2025, Arthur Hayes argues that Bitcoin’s sharp drawdown from its October all-time high is a straightforward consequence of tightening dollar liquidity once derivative-driven “fake flows” into Bitcoin have dried up. For Hayes, Bitcoin is “the free-market weathervane of global fiat liquidity” that trades on expectations of future money supply rather than day-to-day headlines. Why Is The Bitcoin Price Down? He looks back to the “US Liberation Day” turmoil on April 2, 2025, when aggressive tariff moves from the Trump administration initially sparked fears of a depression. After Trump “TACO’d” — his word for calling a truce on tariffs — on April 9, Hayes called for “Up Only!” Bitcoin rallied about 21%, Ether and other “selected shitcoins” followed, and Bitcoin dominance slipped from 63% to 59%. Yet even as his proprietary USD Liquidity Index fell roughly 10% from April 9, Bitcoin still rose 12%. Hayes says that divergence was not some structural decoupling, but a temporary distortion created by ETF basis trades and Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) vehicles. He is particularly blunt about the spot Bitcoin ETF flows that many commentators branded as proof of “institutional adoption.” Looking at BlackRock’s IBIT, Hayes notes that the five largest holders are hedge funds and prop trading desks, which mainly used the ETF as a leg in a basis trade: “They short a CME-listed Bitcoin futures contract vs. buying the ETF to earn the spread between the two.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Social Dominance Hits 4-Month High: What It Means When the annualized basis stands “markedly above the Fed Funds rate, hedge funds will pile into the trade,” generating “large and persistent net inflows into the ETF.” That, he argues, “creates the impression, to those who don’t understand the market microstructure, that there is massive interest from institutional investors for Bitcoin exposure when in reality they don’t give a fuck about Bitcoin, they only play in our sandbox for a few extra points over Fed Funds.” As the basis collapsed, those same players “quickly dump their positions,” producing “massive net outflows” and a negative feedback loop with retail. DATs provided a similar optical illusion. Hayes highlights Strategy (MSTR), which can acquire more Bitcoin when its stock trades at a premium to its underlying holdings, a metric called mNAV. As that premium turned into a discount, its ability to grow BTC holdings cheaply diminished. Together, ETF basis flows and DAT issuance “allowed Bitcoin to rise even though dollar liquidity contracted,” he writes. “But this state of play is over Without these flows obscuring the negative liquidity picture, Bitcoin must fall to reflect the current short-term worry that dollar liquidity will contract or not grow as fast as the politicians promised.” This Will End The Bitcoin Downtrend From there, Hayes goes back to his core premise that “money is politics.” He says it is now time for President Trump and Treasury Secretary “Buffalo Bill” Bessent “to put up or shut up”: either they deploy the Treasury to “run roughshod over the Fed, create another housing bubble, hand out more stimulus checks,” or they are “a bunch of limp-dick charlatans.” He draws a direct parallel to 2022, when President Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen engineered a huge drawdown of the Fed’s reverse repo balances. “Yellen issued more Treasury bills than notes or bonds, which sucked $2.5 trillion out of the Fed’s Reverse Repo Program from 3Q2022 until 1Q2025, which pumped stonks, housing, gold, and crypto.” Hayes says, “I have 100% confidence that [Bessent] will engineer a similar outcome.” In the near term, however, he is cautious. Hayes acknowledges the bull argument that as the US government normalizes operations after the shutdown, the Treasury General Account can be reduced by $100–150 billion and that the Fed will end quantitative tightening on December 1. Related Reading: Can Strategy Survive A 90% Bitcoin Crash? Saylor Says Yes But he points out that “since July approximately $1 trillion of dollar liquidity evaporated based on my index.” Against that backdrop, a $150 billion boost is marginal, and talk of renewed QE remains “just talk” until “Fed whisperer Nick Timiraos” signals otherwise. “The bulls are correct; over time, money printer go Brrrrrr. But first, the markets must retrace the gains since April to better align with the liquidity fundamentals.” How Hayes Positions His Company Hayes says he has already adjusted Maelstrom’s positioning. “Over the weekend, I raised our USD stables position in anticipation of lower crypto prices,” even though the fund is still “long as fuck.” The only token he thinks can “outrun the negative dollar liquidity situation in the short-term” is Zcash (ZEC). “With AI, big tech, and big government, privacy across most sectors of the internet is dead. Zcash and other privacy cryptos using zero-knowledge proof cryptography are humanity’s only chance to fight this new reality.” He argues that it “should offend our sensibilities as disciples of Satoshi” that the third, fourth and fifth largest coins are “a USD-derivative, a do-nothing coin on a do-nothing chain, and CZ’s centralized computer,” and insists “Zcash or a similar type of privacy crypto belongs right below Ethereum.” The current Bitcoin correction, in Hayes’s reading, is also a warning. “The Bitcoin dive from $125,000 to the low $90,000s whilst the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices hover around all-time highs tells me that a credit event is brewing.” He sees scope for a 10–20% equity drawdown and a 10-year US yield near 5%. In that stress, “Bitcoin could absolutely drop to $80,000 to $85,000.” But if that forces the Fed and Treasury to “accelerate their money printing capers,” he believes Bitcoin “could zoom towards $200,000 or $250,000 at year end.” Hayes also expects China to join the next wave of easing once the US clearly accelerates dollar creation. He cites the People’s Bank of China’s recent purchase of government bonds as “the beginning of China QE” and notes Beijing’s anger at the US “stealing” Bitcoin from the Chinese pig butchering scam operator as evidence that Xi Jinping views Bitcoin as a strategic asset. “If both Trump and Xi, leaders of the two largest economies globally, believe that Bitcoin is valuable, why are you not bullish long term?” he asks. At press time, BTC traded at $90,477. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin ETF Launches Next Week as Maxi Doge Presale Breaks $4M",
    "body": "What to Know: Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF is likely to launch on November 24, marking a significant step for Dogecoin’s institutional acceptance. While not 100% confirmed, Eric Balchunas believes the chances of a November launch are very high, based on the Grayscale’s S-1 SEC filing. The upcoming Dogecoin ETF could further boost the potential value of tokens like Maxi Doge. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has already raised over $4M in its presale, with staking rewards of 76% and a token price of $0.0002685. The surge of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is dominating the market, with major launches set to take place next week. One of the most anticipated moves is the launch of Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF, expected to hit the market on November 24, following an amended regulatory filing earlier this month. This marks an exciting new era for Dogecoin ($DOGE) as it is set to gain institutional traction and mainstream visibility. As ETFs flood the market, investors are rushing to position themselves ahead of what could be a major moment in crypto’s broader acceptance, despite Bitcoin’s recent crash below $90K. But alongside the spotlight on ETFs, a new project is also gaining significant momentum in the presale market. 🧨 Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is positioned to make a significant splash in the crypto world. With over $4M raised and staking rewards of 76%, this presale meme coin could be one of the smartest buys in the shifting crypto landscape.

With its compelling value proposition and attractive presale offer, it stands out as one of the best crypto presales of the year.

    "title": "Is SOL Undervalued? $BEST Token and Its Web3 Wallet Could Be the Next 10x Opportunity",
    "body": "What to Know: Solana’s ecosystem growth and institutional integrations highlight rising demand for tools that match its speed, security, and expanding real-world utility. Rising developer activity and on-chain innovation reinforce the view that Solana remains undervalued, increasing the need for wallets that fully support its ecosystem. Best Wallet’s MPC security and integrated DEXes deliver a unified, high-security experience tailored to users engaging with fast-growing networks like Solana. The $BEST token powers a mobile-first, no-KYC wallet ecosystem built to simplify Web3 access while giving users full control and utility-driven rewards. As the crypto market matures, investors are constantly searching for the next big opportunity. This has led to a renewed focus on assets that may be flying under the radar, sparking debates around whether major players like Solana are undervalued. Even as $SOL’s ecosystem continues to mature, some traders believe this crypto is yet to show its full potential. Right now, $SOL is holding firm at a key technical support zone – around $128–$130, with $SOL now back above $130 ). This could form the foundation for a strong rebound if the price reclaims higher levels. Behind this stability lies a thriving ecosystem: hackathons and developer events are flourishing, signaling deep and sustained innovation on the chain. Institutional and retail adoption are also scaling up rapidly. Cash App plans to support USDC payments on Solana in 2026, and SoFi has enabled $SOL trading directly from checking accounts. On-chain use cases are broadening beyond DeFi: real-world projects are tapping into Solana for credit instruments, lending, and other financial applications. Meanwhile, record-breaking fundraising and product launches, from prediction markets to native hardware wallets, demonstrate that Solana’s ecosystem isn’t just growing, it’s evolving. This strong fundamental backdrop of technical resilience, growing adoption, and real utility suggests that $SOL’s current valuation may not fully reflect its potential. And that’s where Best Wallet Token ($BEST) comes in: as users look for more secure, accessible, and powerful ways to interact with high-potential blockchains like Solana, $BEST’s next-gen wallet ecosystem is uniquely positioned to capture this momentum and turn this utility token into a 10x opportunity. That’s because the new conversation isn’t just about price charts; it reflects a deeper trend of users seeking more efficient, secure, and feature-rich ways to interact with crypto. This demand for innovation has exposed cracks in the offerings of established wallet providers. Many are either centralized, creating potential points of failure, or decentralized but lack the mobile-first, user-friendly interface needed for mainstream adoption. They offer basic functions but little else, failing to provide the added benefits and utility that today’s crypto users expect. This gap in the market creates a significant opportunity for a new solution to emerge, one that combines top-tier security with a comprehensive suite of tools designed for both new and experienced investors. Best Wallet and $BEST Redefine On-Chain Security and Access In a landscape where security is paramount, Best Wallet sets a new standard. It is the first fully integrated wallet to use Fireblocks’ advanced MPC-CMP technology , providing institutional-grade security that protects users from common threats like private key theft. This technology removes the single point of failure associated with traditional seed phrases, offering peace of mind. This focus on security is paired with a commitment to accessibility. The platform features a unique ‘Upcoming Tokens’ launchpad, which simplifies the often-complex process of participating in presales. It provides users with vetted, early-stage opportunities, removing barriers for those looking to get in on the ground floor of new projects. This feature is crucial for investors searching for the next breakout token, whether it’s a Solana meme coin or an emerging ecosystem project. Find out more about this wallet ecosystem in our Best Wallet token review . The project’s momentum is undeniable. The Best Wallet Token presale has already raised an impressive $17M+, with $BEST currently priced at $0.025965. This strong early performance signals significant investor confidence in its vision to create the easiest and safest crypto wallet on the market. Check the live $BEST presale. A Multi-Chain Future Demands More Than Basic Swaps Today’s crypto landscape is a multi-chain universe, and Best Wallet is built for it. The platform features the Best DEX aggregator, powered by Rubic, which connects to over 50 chains, 200+ DEXs, and 20 cross-chain bridges. This ensures users always get the best rates for swaps with minimal fees, all within a single, intuitive interface. The $BEST token presale is seeing serious attention thanks to this powerful utility. On-chain data shows whale wallets accumulated $30K+ in single transactions, with the largest recent purchase hitting $30.2K on November 17. This follows several older large transactions, like a $70.2K whale buy back in September. This ‘smart money’ movement suggests big retail investors see long-term potential in the project’s comprehensive approach. For those wondering if Solana is undervalued, the activity around innovative infrastructure like Best Wallet provides a compelling narrative. And beyond its trading capabilities, the $BEST token offers tangible benefits within the ecosystem. Holders gain access to reduced transaction fees and can participate in staking immediately during the presale. With 800M tokens allocated for dynamic APY rewards (now at 76%), early backers can start earning returns on their investment from day one, creating a powerful incentive to join the growing community. The project’s robust features make a strong case for its $BEST’s price potential , with our forecast putting the token at a $0.05 high in 2026 – a 1.9x growth from today’s price of $0.025965.

    "body": "Bitcoin slipped below $90,000 this week, a level it had not touched in seven months, according to data. Traders watched nervously as the flagship token moved around $90,700, leaving it roughly 25% beneath its recent all-time high of just over $126,000 reached on Oct. 6. Markets noted that a big liquidation event on Oct. 10 still echoes through trading desks. Related Reading: From Dotcom To Crypto: Veteran Analyst Says The Bull Run Isn’t Over Analysts See A Near-Term Bottom According to an interview on CNBC, BitMine chairman Tom Lee said the Oct. 10 liquidations and ongoing uncertainty about whether the US Federal Reserve will cut rates in December have kept pressure on crypto. He described signs of exhaustion among sellers and cited technical work suggesting a bottom could appear soon. Tom Lee and Matt Hougan both say crypto prices are getting close to forming a bottom. Source: YouTube Bitwise Asset Management chief investment officer Matt Hougan shared a similar line of thinking, calling current pricing a “generational opportunity” and urging longer-term investors to take notice. He added that traders are jittery about the economy, high AI valuations, and US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which may have added to selling. Selling Fueled Mostly By Short-Term Holders According To XWIN Research, a review of on-chain measures showed short-term holders did much of the heavy lifting in the recent decline. The Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio fell below 1 on multiple occasions, which signals many short-term owners sold at a loss. XWIN also said coins younger than three months made up most of the spent volume during the worst of the drop. That pattern points to panic-driven exits by recent buyers rather than mass, late-cycle distribution by longtime holders. At the same time, metrics such as Coin Days Destroyed, Realized Profit, and Long-Term Holder Net Position Change registered increased distribution by long-term holders since September, but XWIN argued this behavior matches routine profit-taking during a bull run rather than blow-off top selling. Flow From ETFs And Whales Adds Pressure Reports have disclosed that exchange-traded fund outflows and large sales by whales also contributed to the weakness, while rising geopolitical tensions added a further layer of risk. Market participants described Bitcoin as an early mover that started to weaken before other risk assets, which some investors took as a warning signal for broader markets. Related Reading: Crypto Carnage Continues — Tom Lee Exposes What’s Really Going On Outlook Hinges On Stocks And Policy Lee expects a rebound if equities rally later this year, saying a stronger stock market would likely lift Bitcoin back to fresh highs before year-end. Hougan agreed that a recovery could come quickly and that the current window offers an attractive entry for investors planning to hold for 12 months or more. Yet traders remain split; a few see the recent data as clear exhaustion, while others warn macro events and policy decisions could push prices lower before confidence returns.

Projects like Bitcoin Hyper and Maxi Doge show strong presale activity and innovative features. TRON continues to stand out with real-world utility and a well-established market presence. The market is ripe for undervalued cryptos, with many positioned for potential gains post-selloff. The crypto market is currently in a state of flux, with major shifts in investor sentiment as Bitcoin ETFs experience notable outflows. In conversation with MarketWatch, Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant’s head of research, discussed how holdings in Bitcoin ETFs have seen a drastic drop, from 441K $BTC in October to 271K $BTC in November. And data now shows four consecutive days of outflows . Retail investors seem to be avoiding this downturn; however, whales are stepping in with significant purchases.

    "title": "Top Altcoins Heat Up as $BTC Trends Down – Bitcoin Hyper Could Pump Next",
    "body": "What to Know: The altcoin market is showing a distinct preference for projects with strong technological fundamentals and clear utility over purely speculative assets. Recent price predictions suggest a 300% pump for $SHIB if the token reaches two critical levels, which would set it up for an aggressive rally. Bitcoin Hyper introduces a Layer 2 solution that brings high-speed smart contracts to the Bitcoin ecosystem via a Solana Virtual Machine integration. The $HYPER presale raised over $27.8M so far with a token price of $0.013295 and staking rewards currently at 41%. The altcoin market is at a fascinating crossroads. While speculative assets have dominated cycles past, a clear trend toward utility is emerging. Investors are looking past fleeting hype, demanding projects with sustainable technology and real-world use cases. This shift in sentiment is reshaping the altcoin market outlook for 2025, forcing a re-evaluation of long-term value. Take top altcoins like Shiba Inu, for instance, which is currently at a crossroads, showing clear-cut signs of consolidation and momentum buildup. Trader’s expectation of a 300% $SHIB pump long-term is no longer unrealistic, provided $SHIB can hold two critical levels. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is currently at the opposite end of the spectrum, after crashing below $90K today. The reasons are multiple, from bulk whale sells to dwindling investor participation and increased fear. But there’s another problem worth talking about. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, offers unparalleled security and trust but its slow transaction speeds, high fees, and lack of native smart contract capabilities, have hindered its investor appeal. Right now, Bitcoin ranks 30th in terms of TPS . A new contender, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to solve this trilemma directly. As the newest Bitcoin Layer 2 solution integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Hyper promises to unlock Bitcoin’s dormant potential. By creating a high-speed execution layer on top of Bitcoin’s secure settlement, Bitcoin Hyper introduces the programmability and performance needed for modern dApps. This approach could fundamentally alter the competitive dynamics of the blockchain space, bringing high-performance applications to the industry’s most trusted network. Bitcoin Hyper Redefines Speed and Programmability Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) tackles Bitcoin’s core limitations head-on. Its modular architecture uses Bitcoin’s Layer 1 for ultimate security and settlement while a real-time SVM-based Layer 2 handles transaction execution. This allows for extremely low-latency processing and high-speed, low-cost transactions. The project’s decentralized Canonical Bridge facilitates seamless and secure cross-minting of $BTC into its L2 environment. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine, Bitcoin Hyper brings fast, scalable smart contracts to the Bitcoin ecosystem. This move enables developers to build sophisticated DeFi applications, NFT platforms, and gaming dApps using familiar tools like the Rust programming language. This innovative approach is capturing significant attention. The ongoing presale for its native token, $HYPER, has already raised an impressive $27.8M+ at the time of writing, with $HYPER sitting at $0.013295. This strong demand signals major investor confidence in the project’s vision. If this type of hype continues, $HYPER could explode post release. Our price prediction for $HYPER , based on the project’s utility and community support, puts the token at $0.08625 by the end of 2026. In terms of ROI, we’re talking about potential profits of 548%. This is enough of an incentive for any crypto hunter looking for portfolio diversification. If this sounds like you, make sure you read our guide on how to buy $HYPER today. Check $HYPER’s live presale today. A New Ecosystem for DeFi, Gaming, and Payments The implications of bringing high-performance smart contracts to Bitcoin are massive. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) unlocks a wide range of use cases previously impossible on the network, creating a new ecosystem for developers and users alike. Developers can build swaps, lending platforms, and staking protocols that leverage Bitcoin’s liquidity with the speed of an SVM chain. For everyday traders, use cases range from high-speed payments in wrapped $BTC with minimal fees to comprehensive DeFi protocols. With presale tokens currently priced at $0.013295, early participants are getting in at the ground floor – an opportunity which won’t last long anymore. The project has a projected release window between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026 so, if you want to invest, invest today. Secure your $HYPER today. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR and manage risks wisely before investing. Crypto is a high-risk market and presales have no success guarantee.
