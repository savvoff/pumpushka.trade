    "title": "XRP ETFs Could See Aggressive Accumulation – Here Are The Numbers",
    "body": "XRP has entered a new phase in its growth as Spot XRP ETFs begin trading across the United States. The excitement surrounding institutional access to XRP has grown quickly in recent weeks, especially as filings and inflow reports hint at rising interest from funds preparing to scale their exposure. A market commentator known as Chad Steingraber presented a projection showing just how intense ETF accumulation could become if issuers adopt an acquisition strategy similar to what was seen in Bitcoin ETFs. The estimates outline an aggressive period of accumulation that could reduce XRP’s available supply far faster than many expect, and here are the numbers. Related Reading: Trump’s WLFI Moves To Contain Wallet Breach While Federal Inquiry Looms A Breakdown Of Steingraber’s Projection Steingraber’s first scenario examines a modest but steady accumulation model where 12 Spot XRP ETF issuers acquire an average of 3million XRP per day. His projection is based on focusing on the average rather than trying to predict which fund accumulates the most, because the combined impact is what ultimately matters for XRP’s market price. Under this setup, daily inflows would reach up to 36 million XRP. Over a standard five-day trading week, that accumulation would climb to 160 million XRP. Over the course of a month, the amount absorbed by ETFs would increase to 720 million XRP. By the end of a full year, this single projection implies that as much as 8.64 billion XRP could be removed from public circulation and locked into ETFs. Of course, these numbers only take into account the possibility of consecutive net inflow days and no net outflow days. Although these figures are hypothetical, the pace aligns with the early patterns seen in Bitcoin ETFs, where strong averages across issuers created a sustained demand for Bitcoin. A More Aggressive Scenario Based On Recent Activity In another post, Steingraber offered a more forceful accumulation model using the activity of Bitwise’s Spot XRP ETF as a benchmark. Data shows that the Bitwise XRP ETF received inflows of about 5.82 million XRP in its first trading day. In this second scenario, the projected daily acquisition rate is doubled to about 6 million XRP per issuer. If 12 funds follow this pattern, the combined accumulation could hit 72 million XRP every day. Extending the same five-day cycle, the weekly total would rise toward 360 million XRP, while monthly totals would reach approximately 1.44 billion XRP. Over a full year, this more aggressive model ends with 17.28 billion XRP absorbed into ETF products. “The entire XRP public supply will be gone UNLESS THE PRICE GOES ASTRONOMICALLY HIGH,” Steingraber said.

However, BlackRock, which oversees the largest Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, is yet to make any move on a Spot XRP ETF. The company had confirmed in August that it has no immediate plans to file for one. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Hits Major Inflection Point As Rising Wedge Breaks",
    "body": "Bitcoin is now sitting at one of its most critical junctures of the entire cycle. A rising-wedge breakdown has driven price straight into a key support zone just as BTC prints its first major post-ATH drawdown of over 33%, a level that has historically signaled prolonged weakness and heightened volatility. With technical pressure colliding with a historically significant threshold, the market now faces a decisive moment. Rising Wedge Break Sends Bitcoin Lower Into Key Support Zone Crypto analyst The Boss, in a recent breakdown of Bitcoin’s daily chart, highlighted the formation of a rising wedge pattern. As expected, Bitcoin has broken down from this wedge, sending the price sliding into what is considered a strong support zone. This level has historically acted as a turning point, making its current test a crucial moment for the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows A Clear Momentum Reset — Is A Trend Reversal Coming? According to the analyst, this area could trigger a potential upward reaction, as buyers often step in when the price reaches such well-established support levels. However, the possibility of a rebound is not guaranteed. The structure must show early signs of strength before any meaningful recovery can be considered reliable. Momentum indicators paint a cautious picture as they remain notably weak, showing no clear signal of bullish pressure returning to the market. At the same time, trading volume remains lower than necessary for a confident reversal, suggesting that buyers have yet to step in. Without stronger participation, any bounce may be shallow or short-lived. Due to these factors, the analyst emphasized that Bitcoin’s current level must be closely monitored. While a short-term reaction from support is possible, a failure to hold this zone would open the door to further downside and potentially expose deeper support areas. BTC Hits 33% Drawdown Threshold: A Historically Significant Signal According to a recent update shared by Crypto Patel, Bitcoin has now recorded a 33% drawdown from its all-time high, marking a correction significant enough to grab the market’s full attention. This is more than a routine pullback; it represents a level of decline that has historically signaled deeper shifts in market sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces A Negative Correlation Trend And Still Holds Strong — Here’s Why Looking back through previous cycles, every instance where BTC retraced beyond 33% after a peak has been followed by prolonged periods of weakness, increased volatility, and continued downside pressure. These drawdowns often served as transitional phases, where momentum reset before the next major trend could establish itself. The market now sits in a critical phase, with traders and analysts watching closely to see whether Bitcoin repeats its well-known historical behavior or breaks the cycle with a stronger-than-expected recovery.

    "title": "Bitcoin Block Channel Reveals $400,000 Price Target – Details",
    "body": "The Bitcoin market continues to witness an intense price correction in line with broader crypto market movement. In the past week, the premier cryptocurrency recorded another 10% price decline, trading as low as $80,800, before experiencing a modest bounce. Bitcoin now stands 32.79% below its all-time high, with distribution taking preference over accumulation for most investors. However, popular analyst Gert Van Lagen has unveiled an on-chain trend that postulates an impending revival of the bull market. Related Reading: Saylor’s Strategy Under Threat: Index Status At Risk With $8 Billion On The Line Bitcoin Historical Post-Halving Movement Indicates Bullish Hope In an X post on November 21, Gert Van Lagen outlines a positive Bitcoin price prediction based on data from the previous post-halving movement. The renowned analyst explains this forecast, using a long-term logarithmic chart of Bitcoin’s price vs Bitcoin block height, which highlights a regression channel the digital asset has followed since 2009. According to Van Lagen, Bitcoin has followed a similar pattern after every halving, which usually begins with pushing above the midline of this long-term regression channel. Thereafter, the premier cryptocurrency accelerates into a blow-off top (orange spikes) at the channel’s upper boundary as seen in 2013, 2017, and 2021. For all its price exploits in the present market cycle, Bitcoin presently trades just below the midline of the regression channel, suggesting there is ample space for price appreciation. However, Van Lagen notes some unusual price behavior in that Bitcoin has experienced rejection thrice at this midline, each time resulting in a bounce off the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement line. Nevertheless, the analyst still expects the premier cryptocurrency to maintain the 15-year historical trend and eventually secure a decisive move above the midline resistance. If this price development occurs, Van Lagen also predicts Bitcoin to rise to around $350,000 – $400,000, a price range target that aligns with the upper boundary of the regression channel. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Crash To $85,000 Is Actually Good News: Jeff Park The ‘Genuine’ Bearish Market Despite the heightened fears of a bearish market at the moment, Van Lagen explains that the much-dreaded crypto winter only commences after Bitcoin reaches its upper boundary target, establishing a market top. Based on the presented analysis, the market expert predicts Bitcoin will crash from this market peak to retest the 210,000 block SMA, i.e, the lower trend line of the regression channel. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is valued at $84,300 after a 2.36% price loss in the past day. In the last month, the crypto market leader has experienced a 21.96% price devaluation, suggesting a rather volatile and cautious market condition.

Dogecoin derivatives volume increased by more than 30% to roughly $7.22 billion, based on exchange data. XRP derivatives surged as well, jumping about 51% to around $12.74 billion. Based on reports, these spikes reflect traders positioning for potential price swings around the ETF debut. Spot ETFs do not promise higher prices, but they do change who can buy the assets. Brokers, retirement plans, and funds that avoid direct crypto custody may now step in. That could affect liquidity in both the tokens and their markets. At the same time, the overall crypto market has seen pressure; reports say the launches come during a roughly six-week downturn. DOGE market cap currently at $21.4 billion. Chart: TradingView Questions Remain Over Demand And Flows Product fees, custody details, and how the trusts convert into ETF shares will shape investor appetite. Past launches of crypto ETFs showed brisk early flows for some products, while others saw muted interest. What matters for prices is not only listings, but inflows and outflows once trading begins. Related Reading: $2 Billion Gone In Minutes: Bitcoin Slide Shakes Crypto World Investors and analysts are likely to watch the first days of trading for clues. High volume and tight spreads would suggest strong demand. Low turnover or wide spreads could signal tepid interest. Based on reports, market participants will also monitor whether the ETFs draw the same sort of speculative trading that has driven derivatives volume in recent days. The listing of both GDOG and GXRP on the same date marks a notable step for mainstream crypto products. According to exchange filings, the funds are structured as spot ETFs that hold the underlying tokens via custodians. While that does not remove price risk, it does make buying these assets simpler for a broad group of investors. Featured image from Gemini, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "XRP’s price action in November has dragged it below $2, but technical analysis suggests that the breakdown might not be over. A new technical outlook from crypto analyst CasiTrades suggests that the XRP price is entering the final stages of its corrective structure. The analyst believes the current movements are part of a clean Elliott Wave formation that is approaching its final wave to as low as $2.65 before a major bullish reversal takes place. Related Reading: Dogecoin Goes Wall Street: Grayscale Confirms Nov. 24 ETF Launch XRP Breaks Below Fibonacci Levels As Wave Structure Unfolds XRP’s volatility has intensified in recent days as the cryptocurrency continues to unwind into new November lows. Price action across the major exchanges shows a steady decline beneath retracement levels that have pushed XRP into deeper corrective territory. CasiTrades noted that XRP’s drop beneath the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement on Coinbase was the move that confirmed further downside. According to the analyst, she had already warned that a failure of this level would open the door to a wave of selling toward the extended Wave 3 support at roughly $1.84. XRP reached that target with precision, while Binance’s chart tagged its own macro .5 level around $1.88. The current bounce back above $1.9 might be looking like a reversal but is actually a subwave 4 relief move. This means XRP is temporarily recovering from deeply oversold conditions, yet the core market structure still points to one more leg lower before the trend shifts. Based on the Fibonacci map and wave count, the technical outlook is for XRP to retest familiar resistance levels around $2.00 or $2.09 before the final decline begins. 🚨 Get Ready! XRP Likely to test the Macro .618! 🚨 XRP has officially broken below its .5 retracement on Coinbase, and just like I said in my last update, if that level fails, the next target will be the extended Wave 3 support around $1.84. We’ve now reached that perfectly and… pic.twitter.com/tSQdVAlpdY — CasiTrades 🔥 (@CasiTrades) November 21, 2025 $1.65 As The Final Level To Complete Correction The most important area in CasiTrades’ outlook is the macro 0.618 support, located close to $1.65. This level aligns across both Coinbase and Binance and sits at the heart of the analyst’s projection for where Wave 5 of the correction should land. The chart above shows a descending wedge meeting the macro support, along with an RSI trend that has continued building a bullish divergence. These signals suggest that momentum is flattening. However, CasiTrades believes that XRP dipping into the $1.65 region would mark the moment the correction concludes. Related Reading: Kiyosaki Dumps Bitcoin At $90K After Predicting A $250K Moonshot – Here’s Why The analyst also pointed out that Bitcoin’s chart is moving in harmony with XRP’s structure. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has approached its own macro 0.382 retracement but has not fully reached it yet. The expectation is that XRP’s final leg to $1.65 will occur simultaneously with Bitcoin sliding to a clean $80,000 touch. CasiTrades projects Bitcoin entering its Wave 5 advance into new all-time highs shortly after touching its support. If that scenario plays out, both assets would complete their macro supports at the same moment, setting the stage for a synchronized bullish reversal. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.02.

    "title": "Top Analyst Sounds Alarm: Bitcoin Is Highly Unlikely To Spring Back Anytime Soon",
    "body": "Bitcoin is trading in a fragile state after slipping below $90,000 and now in the mid-$80,000s. This price action has caused some analysts to grapple with the possibility that the next major rally may be further away than many expect. A recent technical outlook from prominent crypto analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino adds weight to this concern. His analysis focuses on the 6-week LMACD momentum indicator, which has just crossed bearish for the first time in years. Related Reading: Dogecoin Goes Wall Street: Grayscale Confirms Nov. 24 ETF Launch Momentum Turns Against Bitcoin On The 6-Week LMACD The technical outlook highlights a strong warning from Severino, who argues that Bitcoin is nowhere close to staging the kind of explosive recovery many are waiting for. Severino’s message revolves around momentum, which he says is now firmly pointed downward. The momentum is cited using the recent crossover on the 6-week LMACD, which is known for its decisive crossovers that confirm long-term trend changes. The 6-week LMACD is a lagging signal, meaning that by the time it flips bearish, Bitcoin is already well into a downturn. The chart confirms this with multiple examples: Bitcoin entered extended red phases lasting 812 days, 861 days, and 686 days following previous bearish crossovers. Because the signal lags price action, Bitcoin typically bottoms long after the crossover occurs. Severino noted that bear-market lows always appear between 250 and 365 days after the bearish flip, not within a few weeks. Therefore, traders expecting a bottom only 40 days after the new signal are ignoring how consistently slow this indicator behaves. The chart also highlights how severe each downturn becomes once the LMACD flips bearish. Previous cycles saw drawdowns of roughly 69% to 75% from the moment the cross happened, even though Bitcoin had already fallen significantly before the indicator flashed. Please pay attention to this post if you want to understand why Bitcoin is highly unlikely to suddenly spring back into a bull run One word: Momentum The 6-week LMACD has some of the cleanest crossovers representing pivotal trend change confirmation points. The signal lags,… pic.twitter.com/mq9uR2Fqec — Tony “The Bull” Severino, CMT (@TonyTheBullCMT) November 22, 2025 A Possible Long Road Before Any Significant Recovery Although the LMACD signal just crossed bearish, the current crossover is still unconfirmed for another 15 days, and the resemblance to past cycles is something to keep in mind. Severino noted that he is not predicting the end of Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, but he is urging traders to stop expecting rapid upside. Past behavior does not guarantee the same outcomes, and there is no certainty that Bitcoin will drop another 70% from here like previous cycles. Related Reading: Kiyosaki Dumps Bitcoin At $90K After Predicting A $250K Moonshot – Here’s Why The 6-week LMACD is a high-timeframe signal, and the shifts it captures reflect deep structural trends rather than short-term fluctuations. This means Bitcoin could still be months away from its true cycle bottom. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $85,670, down by 11% and 23% in the past seven and 30 days, respectively. Severino’s analysis means that the Bitcoin price could spend a prolonged period hovering around these levels or experience a further decline before any meaningful recovery into a new bull phase begins.

    "title": "On-Chain Metric Tips Ethereum To Form Price Bottom Below $2,000 – Here’s Why",
    "body": "Ethereum has been a major victim of the ongoing crypto market onslaught, recording a 27.63% loss in the last month alone. The largest altcoin now trades around $2,800, representing a significant fall from the local cycle peak around $4,800. As prices continue to tumble with each new drop triggering waves of liquidation, analyst Ali Martinez has postulated on a market bottom target. Related Reading: Ethereum Golden Pocket In Play – Can ETH Turn The Tide Above $2,800? ETH MVRV Pricing Bands Reveal Potential 28% Decline Ahead In an X post on November 22, Martinez shares critical on-chain data that suggests Ethereum may be headed for a local bottom target around $2,000. For context, the MVRV Pricing Bands are valuation bands derived from the MVRV ratio and Realized Price (RP), designed to indicate when a cryptocurrency (such as ETH) is undervalued, fairly valued, or overvalued based on its on-chain investor cost basis. This on-chain metric reveals a set of price levels calculated by multiplying ETH’s Realized Price by different fixed multiples (e.g., 0.8x, 1.0x, 2.4x, 3.2x), with each band representing a different degree of under- or over-valuation relative to the average investor’s cost basis. Using historical data on this metric, Martinez has identified that Ethereum tends to form a local bottom only when it dips below the lowest pricing band, i.e., 0.8× RP band (blue line). This pattern has consistently played out over the past three years, with clear examples in June 2022, December 2022, and most recently in March 2025. Notably, the current 0.8x RP band stands at $2,007.08. If ETH is repeating historical behavior, then investors should expect another 28% correction from the present market levels to $2000 before a price rebound kicks in. Related Reading: Pundit Reveals Why XRP Price At $1,000 Is Not A Dream – ‘It’s Math’ ETH RP Indicates Investors Remain In Profit — But Not For Long The Realized Price is defined as the average acquisition price of all circulating ETH tokens. It can be described as the true on-chain value of ETH, with any price gain above this level indicating a profit for an average investor and vice versa for a loss. According to Martinez’s on-chain analysis, ETH’s current market price is barely above its realized price at $2,508. While this observation suggests most investors are still in profit, the recent corrections and the extended downtrend indicate a cause for worry, especially as positive market sentiment gets increasingly weaker. While a price fall below $2,500 may pull so many investors into losses, it could also accelerate the token’s decline to $2,000 and trigger a price rebound. Looking at potential mid-cycle targets, this next bullish wave could push Ethereum to trade around $6,021. At press time, Ethereum is valued at $2,820, reflecting a slight 1.73% gain in the last day.

    "title": "Bitcoin Rapid Downturn Triggered By Excessive Long Positions — Expert Weighs In",
    "body": "According to the latest on-chain data, investors have been excessively betting on the Bitcoin price in recent weeks, leading to its overall struggles. Longs Vs Shorts Imbalance — How This Induced Price Crash In a November 22 post on social media platform X, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson revealed the underlying dynamics behind Bitcoin’s recent unchecked fall. In deciphering this downward trend, the crypto pundit evaluated the Estimated Long/Short Positions metric, which estimates how much of the Open Interest across exchanges is dedicated to long positions relative to short positions. Wedson reported that, across 19 exchanges, there are about 71,000 BTC positioned in longs, while a relatively smaller amount of BTC (27,900) is dedicated to shorts. While this observation does not include data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the discrepancy between longs and shorts remains unusually large. Related Reading: Kiyosaki Dumps Bitcoin At $90K After Predicting A $250K Moonshot – Here’s Why This imbalance is significant because when there are clusters of long positions at similar price levels, the market tends to lean into a more fragile state. Moderate pullbacks beneath these clusters often lead to a cascade of forced liquidations (known as a long squeeze) — an event which could in turn push prices further south. Notably, Wedson pointed out that traders must have been convinced that $100,000 was Bitcoin’s price bottom — a speculation that soon became null after its failure. Afterwards, $90,000 came into focus, with another series of liquidations following suit. At the moment, $84,000 seems to be the price majority of Bitcoin’s speculative traders target as the new price bottom. These liquidation events that took place after the $100,000 and $90,000 supports were breached provided more buy-side liquidity for the Bitcoin price to topple. At the same time, most significant short positions have been closed off, making it difficult for a more defined price recovery to take place, as there is barely any sell-side liquidity to send the Bitcoin price to the upside. For Bitcoin to recover, Wedson explained that there needs to be a significant decrease in long positioning, while short exposure goes on the rise. Watch Out For $81,250 — Analyst In another post on X, technical analyst Ali Martinez noted that Bitcoin’s 2-year moving average, which stands at approximately $81,250, is an important landmark for the future trajectory of the flagship cryptocurrency. The analyst explained that historical failures of the 730-day SMA have often marked the beginnings of bear markets. Thus, in the scenario where the Bitcoin price slips past its current 2-year average price, we could be witnessing the start of a long bearish cycle As of press time, Bitcoin holds a valuation of $86,251, reflecting an over 3% price jump in the past 24 hours.
