    "body": "Cardano rallied this month after a clear rebound from a low zone around $0.33–$0.35. Prices jumped more than 10% on January 2, and ADA is up 20% year-to-date. Related Reading: Crypto Market Watches As Clarity Act Enters Senate Debate Next Week: US Senator Reports have disclosed that whale activity spiked on that day across both spot and futures markets, according to recent data. Governance on January 8 approved a 70 million ADA treasury allocation aimed at supporting USDC/USDT integrations, oracle work with Pyth Network, and cross-chain tools. Market players say that is hard cash being put to work. Hoskinson Sees Bitcoin As A Trigger According to Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, a fresh Bitcoin push to a record high would help lift other tokens, including ADA. He has forecast that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 toward the end of this year, a move that would push its market cap to roughly $5 trillion. Hoskinson argued that when Bitcoin leads a rally, investors tend to buy BTC first because it offers liquidity and a sense of relative safety, and then capital flows into higher-risk assets later. UPDATE: #Cardano $ADA Founder Charles Hoskinson says “I believe Bitcoin will reach an all-time high, and I also believe there’s going to be some value leakage from Bitcoin into the altcoin space.” $NIGHT pic.twitter.com/yFAzinx4cs — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) January 7, 2026 Past Runs Show Rotation Into Altcoins Based on reports and past market moves, Bitcoin’s big rallies have often preceded strong gains in alternative tokens. In 2021, Bitcoin climbed to about $68,000 and several major altcoins surged afterwards. Ethereum hit roughly $4,950 in August 2025, while XRP peaked near $3.66 in July of that year. Back then, ADA topped above $3 at its peak. Those episodes are often cited as examples where profit-seeking behavior shifted from the largest coin into smaller projects. Bitcoin’s Recent Highs Did Not Help All Tokens Market watchers point out that history is not a guarantee. In October 2025, Bitcoin reached a new record of $126,198, but only a few assets rode that wave. Many altcoins stayed flat or posted modest gains. That pattern is being used by some analysts to temper expectations about how much value will “leak” from BTC into altcoins this cycle. The size of any rotation, Hoskinson himself warned, is still uncertain and could differ from earlier cycles. Liquidity and macro conditions will matter. ETF flows, trader positioning, and whether developers and users adopt new features are among the things investors will watch. A Measured Outlook Reports note that Cardano’s recent treasury spend targets stablecoins and oracle access, which could help DeFi activity on the network if projects take up the funding. Competition from other layer ones and scaling solutions is real, and capital can move quickly between chains. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Bring The Heat: $1.2 Billion Flows In First 48 Hours—Analyst The view from Hoskinson is bullish on the linkage between Bitcoin highs and altcoin upside, but the evidence from late 2025 shows that link can be uneven. ADA’s recent moves — a bounce from $0.33–$0.35, a more than 10% single-day gain on January 2, and a 70 million ADA treasury allocation on January 8 — give the token practical catalysts beyond market talk. Whether those actions translate into sustained price gains will depend on broader market flows and how the allocated funds are used. Featured image from Gemini, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Price Hits Crash Line, But This Time Is Not Random",
    "body": "According to a new technical analysis, the Bitcoin price has returned to its “Crash Line,” fueling talk of a possible bullish turnaround. The expert behind this analysis has suggested that this is not a random event, but a deliberate move that could signal the beginning of Bitcoin’s next upward move. Bitcoin Price Revisits Familiar Crash Line In a recent post on X, market analyst Crypto Tice announced that Bitcoin has just hit the Crash Line, a level that has repeatedly acted as a critical reload point during the current bull cycle. The analyst indicated that this trendline has historically led to strong price rallies for BTC. He observed that throughout the bull market, Bitcoin has consistently followed the same sequence each time the price returns to the Crash Line. Related Reading: Crypto Market Watches As Clarity Act Enters Senate Debate Next Week: US Senator The process begins with momentum overheating, meaning buyers push prices up too quickly, creating unsustainable upward pressure. As this momentum builds, excessive leverage accumulates in the market, followed by a sharp correction. This price decline often brings Bitcoin back to the Crash Line. From this point, BTC usually starts gearing up for its next expansion phase. Crypto Tice shared a weekly chart illustrating this pattern. Each time Bitcoin approached the Crash Line, its price corrected by about 33.10% and 30.97% before quickly surging higher. Now that Bitcoin has returned to the Crash Line after a recent 33.38% drop, the analyst suggested it could follow the same historical trend and launch a major rally. Crypto Tice also noted that the Crash Line has consistently marked leverage flushes, selling-pressure exhaustion, and trend continuation zones for Bitcoin. Rather than signaling structural weakness, the analyst said this trendline has acted as a transition point. He noted that if the broader structure remains intact, the Crash Line could mark the area where Bitcoin’s upside reloads. Analyst Predicts Next Possible Moves For Bitcoin In a separate X post, market expert Crypto King said that Bitcoin is currently “stuck in a no trading zone,” meaning that the market still lacks a clear direction despite its recent rebound above $90,000. The analyst added that BTC’s liquidity and market participation are drying up, particularly as price moves sideways and the risk of getting caught in false moves increases. As a result, Crypto King has outlined two possible scenarios for Bitcoin. If the cryptocurrency can push above $92,000 and hold that level, he expects it to flip from resistance into support. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator On the other hand, if price fails to reclaim $92,000, the analyst predicts Bitcoin could decline again, this time testing the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap at $88,000. The analyst has highlighted two potential demand zones on the chart: one around the CME gap and another extending lower between $60,000 and $50,000.

    "title": "Analyst Sets $105K As Next Bitcoin Price Target — Here’s The Timeline",
    "body": "After a fairly optimistic start to the new year, the Bitcoin price might finally be ready to take off, as revealed by a market analyst. The pundit believes that the flagship cryptocurrency can reclaim its six-figure valuation over the next few weeks, particularly as a key technical indicator has turned bullish. Why BTC Price Could Be Headed For $105,000 In Three Weeks In a January 9 post on the social media platform X, pseudonymous crypto pundit Bitbull shared a positive outlook for the Bitcoin price in the coming weeks. According to the crypto analyst, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could return to around $103,000 and $105,000 in the next three to four weeks. Related Reading: Cathie Wood: Trump May Buy Bitcoin For US Reserve Ahead Of Midterms This optimistic prediction is based on changes in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the Bitcoin weekly chart. The relative strength index is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis to assess the magnitude and speed of an asset’s price changes. The RSI oscillator typically analyzes whether a crypto asset (Bitcoin, in this case) is being overbought or oversold, suggesting a possible price or trend reversal. When the relative strength index rises above 70, it usually suggests an overbought market condition, with the asset’s price likely to witness a bearish reversal. On the other hand, an RSI value below the 30 mark means that the market is oversold, with the price potentially reaching a bottom. BitBull revealed that the Bitcoin weekly RSI has been in an extended decline in the past three months and has only just broken above the downward trend line. According to the market pundit, the technical indicator is signaling further upside for the Bitcoin price. As observed in the chart above, the price of Bitcoin went on a significant rally the last time the weekly RSI broke out of a downward trend. This breakout last occurred in April 2025, preceding BTC’s rally to its current all-time high of $126,080, representing an almost 50% surge. This time around, BitBull expects the Bitcoin price to rise to between $103,000 and $105,000 in the course of the next three to four weeks. Hitting this target would represent an approximately 15% rally from the current price point. Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, the price of BTC sits around $90,600, reflecting an almost 1% decline in the past 24 hours. While the premier cryptocurrency made a strong start to the year, the market has since cooled down. The Bitcoin price has been mostly hovering around the $90,000 mark, with only a few runs above $91,000 in the past week. According to data from TradingView, the BTC price is up by 3% so far in 2026.

    "title": "Analyst Outlines The Bull Case For XRP And Why Price Will Hit All-Time High Soon",
    "body": "XRP is now back to trading just above the $2 level after an early January rally briefly carried its price action into the $2.40 range. The pullback has so far been controlled, with price holding above former resistance that has now turned into short-term support. A technical analysis shared on X by crypto analyst Bird proposed that conditions are now right for a familiar macro setup that has preceded XRP’s largest historical rallies. The focus of this outlook is on XRP’s reaction with the US dollar index and what its next move could mean for the cryptocurrency.

The chart accompanying his post pointed to three previous periods, around 2017, 2021, and 2024, where sustained weakness in the dollar coincided with aggressive upside moves in XRP. In each of those cycles, red candles on the DXY chart led to a loss of dollar strength, while XRP responded with strong upward expansion shortly after. This recurring pattern means that XRP’s largest moves tend to follow macro shifts, not just even events related to XRP. When dollar dominance fades, capital always rotates into crypto assets, and XRP has been one of the primary beneficiaries of that transition. Interestingly, the current setup shows that DXY has returned to a similar structural zone seen before past rollovers. As shown in the chart below, the DXY is now trending downwards.

The first highlighted phase captures the late-2017 to early-2018 cycle, when a weakening dollar backdrop lined up with XRP’s rally run into the cycle peak in the mid-$3 range. A similar relationship appeared around the 2020-2021 window, where dollar softness was followed by XRP surging to $1.90 at its cycle top. The latest was in H1 2025, which culminated in XRP reaching its current all-time high of $3.65 in July. The important context is why the current moment is a decision point. At the time of writing, the DXY is sitting around 99, and from here it can either turn lower and start printing red candles again or catch a bid and print green. If DXY starts printing red candles again and rolls over, the pattern Bird is pointing to suggests the macro backdrop becomes supportive for another strong XRP leg higher, which is why a new all-time high above $3.65 could come into view within the next few months.

Either way, the dollar’s next move will signal what comes next. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",
