    "title": "Will Bitcoin Price Crash Today? BlackRock’s BTC Moves Shakes Market",
    "body": "BlackRock has transferred a significant amount of BTC to the crypto exchange Coinbase, sparking concerns about a sell-off. This comes as the Bitcoin price continues to struggle to break above $90,000 successfully. Bitcoin Price At Risk as BlackRock Transfers BTC Arkham data shows that Blackrock deposited 2,201 BTC ($192.13 million) into Coinbase, putting the Bitcoin price at risk of further decline amid increasing selling pressure. The move followed the outflow recorded by BlackRock’s BTC ETF on December 26, with Bitcoin funds as a group seeing a net outflow of $275.88 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin News: Here’s How Much Was Liquidated In The Crypto Market In 2025 These Bitcoin ETFs are currently on a seven-day outflow streak, which also prompted BlackRock to deposit 6,174.39 BTC last week, likely to offload these coins and redeem shares of its BTC fund. The Bitcoin price has struggled to break above $90,000 amid these outflows from the BTC funds. Notably, the Bitcoin price had broken above $90,000 on December 28 but quickly lost those gains yesterday as BlackRock moved the coins to Coinbase. Crypto pundit Martini claimed that BlackRock wasn’t the only one putting significant selling pressure on the flagship crypto. He alleged that Binance, Wintermute, Coinbase, and Fidelity also sold a significant amount of BTC, collectively dumping $3.5 billion yesterday. Crypto pundit Bull Theory claimed that there was a weekend manipulation as the Bitcoin price pumped $3,000 and broke $90,000, liquidating $103 million worth of shorts this Sunday. He then noted that on Monday morning, BTC dumped $2,700 and liquidated $40 million worth of longs, erasing its entire pump in the process. With the current price action, BTC is heading for a red yearly close, as it is currently down over 6% year-to-date (YTD). BTC Could Bottom Out Soon Against Other Major Assets In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that most of the data continues to become more favorable for the Bitcoin price, putting in a bottom against the equity markets and gold in the coming weeks. He added that the data also points to the flagship crypto outperforming these assets. The analyst stated that this was based on just factual data and not emotions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Entered A Bear Market, And This Data Backs It Up The Bitcoin price had notably outperformed these major assets at the start of the year but has since fallen behind, following the October 10 crypto crash. Gold is up 66% year-to-date while the S&P 500 is up 17% since the start of the year. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows also predicted that BTC could soon rally, noting that the long-term holders have stopped selling for the first time since July 2025. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $87,300, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "body": "Solana (SOL) is retesting a make-or-break area that could set the stage for a major move at the start of next year. Some analysts have suggested that altcoin’s chart signals a bearish performance for the coming months. Related Reading: Here’s Why Bitcoin Advocate Max Keiser Restates Bullish Outlook For 2025 Solana Faces Another Rejection From Key Resistance After hitting a three-week high of $130 on Sunday, Solana started the week with a 6.1% correction to the $122 area. The cryptocurrency recently breached below its macro support around the $120 zone, hitting an eight-month low of $116 in mid-December. Since then, the altcoin has been trading between the $120-$126 mark, attempting to break out of the local resistance multiple times but ultimately being rejected after each retest. SOL’s price surged around 5.6% toward during Sunday’s broader market bounce, trying to build a base below the crucial resistance level before plunging after the early Monday correction. Amid this performance, market observer Crypto Jobs pointed out that Solana had broken out of a six-week falling wedge, which could target the $144-$146 area if momentum holds and price confirms a retest of the breakout. However, the star-of-week pullback has momentarily sent SOL below the pattern’s upper boundary. Analyst Man of Bitcoin also highlighted that the cryptocurrency had broken above a one-month downtrend line, which suggested an initial move toward the $129-$130 area. The analyst explained that “holding above the broken trendline is key to maintaining upside momentum,” but noted that as long as the price remains below $146, a scenario where price is headed for one more low, around the $100-105 horizontal support, remains likely. Following the Monday rejection, he affirmed that “it could be that wave-4 is already complete. A decisive break below the trendline would confirm this further.” SOL’s Higher Timeframe Chart Shows Troubling Signs Market watcher Elite Crypto affirmed that Solana “doesn’t look very strong” on the higher timeframe, pointing to a multi-year bearish pattern potentially forming on SOL’s chart. According to X analysis, the cryptocurrency has been developing a Head and Shoulder pattern since early 2024, with the neckline sitting around the $105 area in the weekly timeframe. The char shows that left shoulder formed during the Q1 2024 rally, while the head and right shoulder formed during its rally to its latest all-time high (ATH) in Q1 and Q3 2025 breakouts, respectively. “If $SOL loses the $105 support then the price could move down to the $75–$51 range and this phase may last until mid 2026,” the investor detailed, adding that “after this period, the overall trend for SOL can turn bullish and set up a better move ahead.” Similarly, Henry from Lord of Alts suggested that Solana has formed a double top formation with the neckline around the current levels instead of a Head and Shoulders pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Red Yearly Close: Galaxy Digital Explains The Setup Per the analyst, “We put in a clean double top, rolled over, and now price is going back toward a zone that’s acted as real support before.” If the altcoin fails to hold the current support, its price could retrace toward the $60 mark, the chart shows. Moreover, he added that SOL’s price could also risk a drop to the $35 area in the coming months as there’s “a big gap below that market hasn’t dealt with yet.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Key Catalyst For Potential Surge Toward $150,000 Next Year",
    "body": "As Bitcoin (BTC) maintains a consolidated trading range between $86,000 and $90,000 after experiencing a 30% correction from its all-time high in October, market expectations for the cryptocurrency’s future remain optimistic. Market analyst Dominic Basulto from The Motley Fool believes that despite the persistent challenges seen in the fourth quarter of the year, Bitcoin could soar to $150,000 by 2026, fueled by the newly established US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Is $150,000 Possible For Bitcoin? Historical context supports Basulto’s prediction; Bitcoin’s performance over the years has shown significant recovery potential, with 2015 marking its worst bull market year at just a 36% gain. Significantly, in seven of its years, Bitcoin has achieved triple-digit percentage returns. The analyst suggests that 2026 may resemble 2019, a year when Bitcoin appreciated by 95% following the dismal performance in 2018, when it plummeted by 74%. Related Reading: XRP Supply Shock Incoming? Expert Reveals The Truth In 2019, several catalysts, such as heightened global economic uncertainty and a surge in institutional interest, propelled Bitcoin upwards—situations that appear similar to current conditions. Institutional investors are increasingly adding BTC to their portfolios, driven by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Meanwhile, concerns over global tariffs and macroeconomic instability in the US continue to resonate among investors, setting the stage for potential bullish movement. However, Basulto emphasizes that Bitcoin can only reach the $150,000 milestone if it is perceived as a long-term store of value. If investors view it merely as another high-risk asset, they may choose to favor physical gold over digital gold, which has seen a record-breaking year. The crux of his argument centers on one pivotal factor that could significantly impact Bitcoin’s price: a notable increase in purchases by the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. What Happens If Nations Stockpile BTC? Basulto claims that if the US government were to start buying substantial quantities of Bitcoin, it could trigger a global arms race among other countries keen to create their own strategic BTC reserves. According to the analyst, such purchases from national reserves could dramatically inflate Bitcoin’s price, likely surpassing the impact of corporate treasury companies that have already amassed close to 5% of the world’s circulating BTC supply. Related Reading: Investment Firm CEO Drops Utility Bomb On XRP, Is Community Hype A Detriment? Although reaching the $150,000 mark may seem ambitious given Bitcoin’s recent performance, more aggressive predictions exist for 2026. For instance, JPMorgan Chase has forecasted a potential price of $170,000, while Wall Street strategist Tom Lee from Fundstrat has suggested that BTC might even hit $250,000 next year. While a variety of factors must align for BTC to reclaim its status as digital gold, the possibility of elevated prices hinges on strategic actions by both the US government and institutional investors. Basulto concluded that if the leading cryptocurrency can consolidate its position and the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve gains traction, the predicted price of $150,000 could be achieved by next year. At the time of writing, BTC’s price retraced towards $87,330 following an early Monday move above $90,500. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Selling Pressure Returns: Investors Shift From Holding to Distribution",
    "body": "XRP is trading below critical technical levels after losing the $2 mark, a breakdown that has shifted market sentiment decisively toward fear. Bulls are struggling to find reliable support as price action weakens, and recent attempts at stabilization have failed to attract sustained demand. The loss of this psychological and structural level has left XRP vulnerable, with traders increasingly positioning defensively amid broader uncertainty across the altcoin market. Related Reading: Why $100,000 Is Bitcoin’s Most Important Resistance Level According to analysis shared by Darkfost, selling pressure on XRP has intensified materially over recent weeks. The data shows that the current move is not a minor pullback, but part of a deeper corrective phase. XRP has declined by roughly 50% from its cycle peak near $3.66, falling toward the $1.85 region. This magnitude of decline reflects a clear shift in market behavior, as earlier optimism has given way to risk reduction and capital preservation. Darkfost’s assessment suggests that the increase in selling is driven by a combination of profit-taking from older positions and capitulation from more recent buyers who entered at higher levels. As the price moves further away from prior highs, confidence has deteriorated, reinforcing the downside momentum. Exchange Inflows Highlight Rising Sell-Side Pressure Darkfost further explains that the recent surge in selling pressure becomes especially clear when examining XRP inflows to exchanges, with Binance standing out as the primary focal point. As the exchange that concentrates the largest share of XRP trading volume, Binance often serves as an early indicator of shifting market intent. Rising inflows to exchanges are commonly interpreted as a signal that holders are preparing to sell, particularly when the increase is sudden and sustained. After several weeks of relatively calm conditions, characterized by stable and moderate inflows, this pattern changed sharply around December 15. Since then, XRP transfers to Binance have accelerated, with daily inflows consistently ranging between 35 million XRP and a pronounced spike of roughly 116 million XRP recorded on December 19. This marks a clear break from the prior holding-oriented behavior observed through much of October and November. The shift in inflow dynamics suggests a change in investor psychology. Longer-term holders appear to be taking profits after XRP’s strong run earlier in the cycle, while more recent entrants are increasingly capitulating and selling at a loss as the price continues to slide. This combination amplifies downside pressure and reinforces the current corrective trend. As long as elevated exchange inflows persist, conditions for accumulation remain unfavorable. Without a meaningful slowdown in deposits, XRP is likely to struggle to form a durable base, increasing the risk that the correction extends further in both time and depth. Related Reading: Trust Wallet Exploit Drains $7M: Hundreds Of Users Affected XRP Price Action Details: Testing Demand XRP continues to trade under clear technical pressure, with price hovering near the $1.87–$1.90 zone after a prolonged downtrend on the daily chart. The structure shows a decisive loss of bullish control following the rejection from the $3.00–$3.50 region earlier in the year. Since that peak, XRP has consistently printed lower highs and lower lows, confirming a bearish market structure that remains intact. From a trend perspective, the price is trading below all major moving averages. The short-term moving average has turned sharply lower and now acts as immediate dynamic resistance, while the medium- and long-term averages are also sloping downward, reinforcing the broader bearish bias. Each recent attempt at a relief bounce has failed below these averages, suggesting that sellers continue to dominate rallies. Related Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Inflows Collapse While Binance Retains Relative Activity – Details The $1.80–$1.85 region is now a critical support area. This zone has absorbed several tests in recent weeks, indicating short-term demand, but the lack of a strong rebound highlights weak buying conviction. A clean break below this level would expose XRP to a deeper retracement toward the $1.50 region, where historical demand previously emerged. Unless XRP can reclaim the $2.10–$2.20 range and hold above it, the path of least resistance remains to the downside, with risks skewed toward further consolidation or continuation of the correction.

    "title": "Dogecoin Chart Mirrors Silver’s Breakout, Analyst Flags $9+ Scenario",
    "body": "Silver has staged a historic, late-December breakout, surging from roughly $50 an ounce in mid-November to an intraday all-time high above $83, before easing slightly as traders took profits. Will Dogecoin follow its lead? At press time, spot silver was holding near $76 after pulling back from the earlier record high of $83.62, with the metal up roughly 181% year-to-date in 2025, an outsized move for the precious-metal. The rally is attributed to a mix of macro and market-structure drivers including expectations for easier US monetary policy in 2026, strong industrial and investment demand, persistent supply shortfalls, and silver’s recent designation as a US “critical mineral,” which added a policy-sensitive supply narrative to an already tight market. The ‘Silver Fractal’ Pitch For Dogecoin That silver move is now being used as a visual analog in crypto. X analyst Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) posted a side-by-side TradingView comparison suggesting Dogecoin’s 6-month chart resembles silver’s 3-day structure from three weeks ago, implying DOGE could be positioned for a similarly persistent advance if the fractal holds. In the shared DOGE 6-month panel, Cantonese Cat shows a large selloff candle and frames it as a potential cyclical low. Based on the silver comparison, the interpretation is not “DOGE pumps next week,” but “DOGE trends for years.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Triangle Formation Breakdown Spells Trouble As 15% Move Nears – Time To Be Cautious? In the proposed fractal path, the current 6-month candle would mark the bottom, followed by eight additional 6-month candles spanning roughly four years where seven are green and only one is red. The lone red candle is mapped as the third in the sequence, implying the first half of 2027 could be a down half-year even within an overarching uptrend. If the pattern were to track silver “exactly,” the projected cycle peak would land in the second half of 2029, with a peak price “above $11” in that window. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Repeating Its 2020 Accumulation Cycle, Analyst Says How It Fits His Earlier Wave Framework The comparison follows Cantonese Cat’s earlier Dec. 20 post outlining a longer-horizon DOGE roadmap on the weekly chart. “We’ve already had a 13 month bear market for DOGE, with my working hypothesis of this being likely a wave 2 correction prior to wave 3 explosion,” the analyst wrote. The accompanying weekly DOGE chart labels the prior advance as “Wave 1” and the subsequent decline as “Wave 2,” with a descending trendline drawn across the multi-year structure. The Dec. 20 weekly snapshot shows DOGE around $0.13160 with retracement levels including 0.382 at about $0.11771, and 0.236 at about $0.08427, with the base (“0”) around $0.04909. Above the current price, the analysis maps 0.5 at about $0.15422 as the next resistance, followed by 0.618 at about $0.20205, 0.707 at about $0.24770, 0.786 at about $0.29681, and 0.886 at about $0.37315, before the 1.0 level near $0.48442. Above the prior high, the same map plots extension targets often used in Elliott Wave projection frameworks, labeled near 1.272 ($0.90288), 1.414 ($1.24968), 1.618 ($1.99344), 2 ($4.77927), and 2.272 ($8.90771). The implication is conditional: the extensions matter only if DOGE completes the corrective phase and reclaims the prior impulse high.

    "title": "Here’s Why The ZCash (ZEC) Price Rallied Above $500 Again",
    "body": "The Zcash (ZEC) price has rallied above the psychological $500 level, providing a bullish outlook for the privacy-focused token. This comes amid a notable surge in whale accumulation and derivatives activity among crypto traders. Why Zcash (ZEC) Price Rallied Above $500 Despite Crypto Market Decline CoinMarketCap data show that the Zcash (ZEC) price has rallied above $500 again, up over 20% in the last week. This comes despite the crypto market downtrend, with Bitcoin trading in a tight range just below the psychological $90,000 level. The ZEC surge above $500 comes amid a significant increase in whale accumulation, which has contributed to this price surge. Related Reading: Zcash Explodes 700% Since September – What’s Driving The Rally Amid The Bear Market? Nansen data show a 47% increase in ZEC whale holdings, with the top 100 addresses now holding 66% of the token’s total supply. This has likely created a supply shock, sparking a rise in the Zcash (ZEC) price. Notably, there has been a 55.36% drop in the supply held by exchanges, further highlighting the accumulation trend, with investors likely moving their coins off-exchanges for long-term holding. On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain also highlighted the accumulation trend among these whales. In an X post, Lookchain revealed two newly created wallets that withdrew 26,241 ZEC ($13.5 million) from Binance. In another post, the on-chain analytics platform revealed that another whale withdrew 7,714 ZEC ($4.12 million) from Kraken. Lookonchain had also drawn attention to a whale that withdrew 30,000 ZEC ($13.25 million) from Binance last week. Activity in the derivatives market has also contributed to the Zcash (ZEC) price rally above $500. CoinGlass data show an increase in the altcoin’s open interest, indicating that traders are increasing their positions. Most of these traders are currently long with the long/short ratio above 1. This recovery marks a positive for the privacy token, which had dropped to as low as $310 earlier this month. ZEC is notably the best-performing crypto among the top tokens with a year-to-date (YTD) gain of around 800%. ‘Next Stop Is $1,000’ BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes declared in an X post that the next stop for the Zcash (ZEC) price is $1,000 following its recovery above $500. This represents a potential 100% gain from its current price level. The BitMEX co-founder has been bullish on the privacy token for some time now, predicting it could eventually reach $10,000. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Bull And Bear Cases That Crypto Traders Should Know About Meanwhile, Zcash’s co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson suggested that the Zcash (ZEC) price will continue to rally because of its good product, scarcity, and regulatory atmosphere. He noted that privacy is now widely recognized as necessary in crypto. As such, the privacy narrative is expected to keep fueling this price surge. At the time of writing, the Zcash (ZEC) price is trading at around $536, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "body": "Search interest for the word “crypto” has fallen to levels not seen in a year, signaling a sharp drop in retail curiosity as 2025 ends. According to recent Google Trends readings, worldwide interest stood at 26 on the 0–100 scale, just above this year’s low of 24. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forecasts For 2026 Range From $65K To $250K As Sentiment Hits ‘Extreme Fear’ Searches Slide As Prices And Headlines Stumble Based on reports, US search activity for “crypto” hit a one-year low of 26, underscoring that casual investors are not hunting for basic information the way they did in earlier cycles. The dip follows a turbulent year that included a severe market sell-off in April and a sharp October flash crash that knocked major coins down from recent highs. Market watchers point to several triggers. Memecoin collapses tied to high-profile figures shook confidence. Policy shocks tied to US President Donald Trump’s tariff moves also coincided with big drops in interest during the spring. Some commentators say retail users moved on after heavy losses and viral token drama. There is close to no retail interest in crypto right now Do we need to start pumping the dino coins again to get retail to come back? After the Trump/Melania memecoin drama it seems that retail lost a lot of faith in the space None of my normie friends or family ask me… pic.twitter.com/ZNnOwT4FKe — 0xMarioNawfal (@RoundtableSpace) December 27, 2025 Retail Pullback Could Mean Quieter Weeks Ahead The practical effect is a quieter retail base. Trading volumes from small accounts have thinned. That does not mean prices must fall; it can mean fewer headline-grabbing rallies driven by newcomers. Institutions, which do not typically show up in Google searches, still play a big role in market flow. Year-end coverage highlights that institutional activity and regulatory moves shaped much of 2025’s action. Analysts Offer Different Takes On What Comes Next Some analysts warn that low retail interest removes a source of quick upside, making long rallies harder to sustain without strong macro catalysts. Others argue this lull is a pause, and that interest can return if prices break out or a major positive regulatory decision lands. Mario Nawfal and other commentators have described the current environment as a near-total absence of retail buzz. Data Points And What They Show The Google Trends scale gives a quick read. A 26 reading is low compared with earlier peaks during boom months. Reports from several industry outlets show the same pattern across regions, with the US particularly muted. Industry trackers note that big headline events still move markets, but everyday search traffic — the kind that often signals mass retail involvement — is down. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rules The Decade: Outshines Gold And Silver, Analyst Says A fall in Google searches is a sentiment indicator, not a trading rule. It shows fewer people are asking basic questions like how to buy or where to trade. That can cut both upside and downside volatility driven by inexperienced traders. Crypto is likely to remain under the radar until new catalysts appear, like significant price changes, regulatory updates, or a compelling story that captures mainstream interest again.

    "body": "On-chain data shows XRP has seen a significant value on the Binance Exchange Inflow during the last couple of weeks, a sign that may be bearish for the asset’s price. XRP Binance Exchange Inflow Has Shot Up To End 2025 As pointed out by Darkfrost in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Exchange Inflow has been elevated for XRP recently. The “Exchange Inflow” is an indicator that measures the total amount of the asset that investors are depositing into wallets connected with a given centralized exchange. Related Reading: XRP Triangle Hints At Potential 10% Move—But In Which Direction? When the value of the metric is high, it means traders are moving large amounts from self-custodial wallets to the exchange. As one of the main reasons why holders deposit to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have bearish implications for the token’s price. On the other hand, the indicator being low suggests that demand for transferring coins to the exchange is low among the investors. Depending on whether withdrawals are also occurring, such a trend may be neutral or bullish for the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the XRP Exchange Inflow for the Binance platform over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Binance Exchange Inflow was at relatively muted levels between October and the first half of December, suggesting exchanges weren’t receiving that many deposit transactions. This trend flipped starting December 15th, however, as the indicator witnessed a surge. Its value has since maintained above 35 million tokens, with a particularly sharp peak of 116 million coins coming on the 19th. The analyst has noted that the shift in investor behavior points to “a move toward profit taking for older positions, as well as capitulation and loss selling from more recent entrants.” The surge in the Exchange Inflow has arrived as the XRP price has plunged under the $2.0 level. The fact that these deposits have been sustained could be a reason why the coin has been unable to make much recovery. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply Overhang: 6.6 Million BTC Bought Above Current Price “If this selling pressure continues, the current correction could not only extend in time but also deepen further,” noted Darkfrost. It now remains to be seen how the Exchange Inflow will develop as 2026 arrives. The Exchange Inflow provides just one way to gauge selling pressure in the market. Another method is through tracking the supply attached to the whales. As analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted using data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment in an X post, the big-money XRP investors have seen their supply go down recently. From the chart, it’s visible that XRP whales have shed 40 million tokens recently, showcasing that large investors have been in a phase of net distribution. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $1.87, down almost 3% in the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, CryptoQuant.com, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "A crypto expert has addressed the arguments suggesting that the XRP price could never reach $10,000. He explained that XRP is in a different league from most cryptocurrencies, making traditional valuation methods less effective. The expert also asserts that XRP is designed to handle large-scale institutional flows and, as a result, a $10,000 valuation cannot be ruled out entirely in the long run. Why The XRP Price Could Reach $10,000 Stern Drew, the founder and CEO of Stageyo, the world’s first digital marketplace for stage performers, has weighed in on the long-running debate around the future price potential of XRP. On X, the founder argued that many projections dismissing a $10,000 XRP price are flawed because they apply the wrong framework and mathematical models to the asset. Related Reading: Pundit Shares Why XRP Will Become Expensive And A $1,000 Price Tag Is Possible According to him, XRP should not be evaluated using the same assumptions as retail-driven cryptocurrencies. Drew explained that comparisons with Bitcoin and other digital assets often ignore scale entirely. He pointed out that a single Ripple partner can move more value in one day for XRP than Bitcoin processes in an entire year. This difference in settlement volume is central to how the expert believes that XRP’s future value should be gauged. The Stageyo founder further stressed that XRP was primarily designed for institutional settlement rather than speculative trading. Its core use case is tied to moving large volumes of capital across borders effectively. In that context, Drew has suggested that price expectations that rule out levels like $10,000 based on retail demand or historical crypto cycles are not relevant. He argued that low prices do not make sense when a cryptocurrency is handling massive institutional inflows. If XRP is used for high-value settlements, a higher price per token increases efficiency. This means fewer tokens will be needed to transfer the same amount of value, reducing friction and speeding up transactions. Drew described this concept as a different kind of math that applies to a “different league” of financial activity. Rather than focusing on market capitalization to gauge a cryptocurrency’s future value, the expert emphasizes liquidity and transaction throughput. From this perspective, he links the possibility of XRP reaching $10,000 to its intended role in the global financial system. XRP Positions For Major Role In Global Banking In a separate X post, Drew drew attention to a recent statement made by the Bank of Japan (BOJ). Notably, the BOJ disclosed that both Japan and South Korea are working together on developing blockchain infrastructure, subtly referencing XRP and Ripple in its announcement.

Reports reveal that official discussions are currently private, but their impact is expected to be significant. The BOJ highlighted that XRP holders should watch out and brace for future developments, as this collaboration could become a transformative moment for Ripple. Notably, the crypto payments company has already established relationships with some of Japan’s largest financial institutions, including SBI Holdings. Moreover, South Korea has been a major investor in XRP over the years. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "XRP Still Has A Path To $28 This Cycle, Analyst Says",
    "body": "XRP could still reach $28 this cycle under a “non-base-case” scenario driven by an altcoin-heavy rotation, according to CryptoInsightUK analyst Will Taylor, who argued that XRP’s multi-year technical compression leaves room for an outsized move if market structure and sentiment align. In his Dec. 27 “Weekly Insight” newsletter, Taylor framed the call inside a broader thesis: that capital chasing breakouts in traditional markets could eventually rotate into crypto, amplifying returns given crypto’s smaller aggregate market cap. Within that setup, XRP is his “core position,” and the token he sees as a primary beneficiary if altcoins capture a larger share of the cycle’s upside. Can XRP Still Reach $28 This Cycle? Taylor’s XRP outlook is tied to his expectation that total crypto market cap can reach roughly $10 trillion this cycle, a level he characterized as consistent with prior cycle behavior. The more important variable, in his view, is where Bitcoin dominance lands if that scenario plays out. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Inflows Spike To End 2025: Will Price Decline Deepen? He wrote that dominance could fall into the “35.3 percent and 31.5 percent range,” which would imply Bitcoin at roughly a $3 trillion to $4 trillion market cap in that environment and “leave the door open for around six trillion dollars to flow into altcoins.” That’s the backdrop for his XRP targets: not a claim about XRP alone, but a wager on the size of the altcoin pie if the market turns risk-on. Taylor also pointed to a prior discussion with trader Credible Crypto as an example of how high-cycle targets can emerge when liquidity, positioning, and sentiment converge. “My pinned post on X is a conversation with Credible Crypto where he talks about how, for example, XRP could go to $26 if the stars align for a cycle like this,” Taylor wrote. “And right now, it genuinely feels like those stars are starting to align.” Taylor disclosed that XRP is the overwhelming majority of his portfolio, a disclosure he flagged as a potential bias. “As you guys know, I am around 90 percent XRP in my portfolio, so I definitely have some bias here,” he wrote, before laying out a profit-taking framework centered on a mid-cycle target zone. “I would not be too surprised to see XRP reach a minimum of eight to thirteen dollars,” Taylor wrote. “I have discussed many times that I would be taking a lot of profit in that range, with an outside maximum target of up to around twenty eight dollars.” Related Reading: XRP Supply Shock Incoming? Expert Reveals The Truth He tied the higher-end target to a technical read of XRP’s long consolidation and the possibility that an altcoin-led cycle could be larger than many investors expect. Taylor described the $28 level as derived from the “initial breakout from the 2017 to 2018 cycle,” while emphasizing he had deliberately “diminished expectations” versus modeling a more aggressive, multi-leg extension. Even so, his risk management plan is explicit about reducing exposure in the $8 to $13 band. “As I have said before, I plan to heavily de leverage between eight and thirteen dollars if we are offered that opportunity,” he wrote. “I will not be selling all of my bags, though, because I do think there is an outside chance that we push higher, potentially toward the twenty eight dollar area.” The Argument For XRP Taylor’s core claim is that XRP’s structure is different from many large-cap alts because it has, in his view, spent longer in “compression” and is now emerging from it. He argued XRP “has experienced longer compression than most altcoins, has broken out of an eight year trend, and has held previous seven year resistance as support.” He also suggested that a favorable US policy narrative could act as an accelerant in a euphoric phase, pointing to “the rhetoric around US companies,” the “US Clarity Act,” and Ripple “remaining based in the US” as factors that could make a higher-end outcome less implausible in a risk-on environment. Still, Taylor repeatedly stressed that the $28 figure is not his central expectation. “That being said, and I want to be very clear on this, this is not my primary target,” he wrote. “My primary target is and has been between eight and twelve dollars, potentially stretching to fifteen or sixteen dollars this cycle. The move toward twenty eight dollars is an outside scenario, not a base case.” At press time, XRP traded at $1.86. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Investor Paul Barron’s hint at “big news” has reignited attention on XRP exchange-traded funds this week, sending the community into speculation over possible upcoming announcements or launches. Related Reading: Crypto Heat Fizzling Out? US Search Interest Plunges As Retail Shy Away Traders and holders reacted fast on social channels, pushing chatter and price focus higher even as specifics remain unclear. ETF Flows Heat Up According to data shared by Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs dominated year-to-date inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF led with $25 billion in inflows. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF followed at $1.11 billion. Fidelity and VanEck posted $477 million and $305 million respectively. On the Ethereum side, BlackRock’s offerings recorded about $9.12 billion. A Solana staking ETF from Bitwise pulled in $839 million. These numbers show where most large investors are putting money right now. Expect some big news this week $XRP ETFs https://t.co/3BY5XJosPx — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) December 29, 2025 Community Reaction And Speculation Barron’s remark has been read by many as a hint at another XRP-related announcement. Some expect a new ETF launch; others are watching for updates from issuers already in the market. That talk has helped push attention — and inflows — to XRP products that only debuted late in the year. XRP Ledger Tokenization Surge Based on reports from rwa.xyz, on-chain data indicates tokenized real-world assets on the XRP Ledger rose by 2,200% in 2025. The network saw about 23x growth in the value of native real-world assets, including stablecoins, and crossed the $500 million threshold. Themes around RWA tokenization were widely discussed this year by figures such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and former SEC Chair Paul Atkins, and the XRPL appears to be drawing benefit from that interest. XRP ETFs Show Early Strength Canary’s XRP ETF (XRPC) registered $384 million in year-to-date inflows after launching in November. Other XRP spot funds have built sizable holdings too: 21Shares holds about $250 million, Bitwise roughly $227 million, Grayscale around $244 million, and Franklin about $206 million. Based on reports, all of these XRP spot ETFs launched in November and December and now tally roughly $1.24 billion in total assets under management with cumulative inflows near $1.14 billion. For a new category, that level of money moving in over a short span is notable; some industry voices point out the total might have been higher if market mood had not cooled recently. Reports also say XRP ETFs pulled in over $1 billion through 21 days of steady inflows. Pending Products And Rumors WisdomTree’s XRP ETF is among the pending offerings that market watchers expect to arrive next. At the same time, talk about a BlackRock XRP ETF has circulated widely. There is currently no public filing tied to a BlackRock XRP product, and reports caution that such expectations are premature without official filings or approvals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rules The Decade: Outshines Gold And Silver, Analyst Says Current flows note that XRP’s ETF debut has shifted part of investor focus from pure crypto bets to spot ETF allocations and tokenization themes. Whether Barron’s hinted “big news” becomes a concrete catalyst will depend on filings and formal product launches. For now, the mix of solid early inflows and rapid XRPL tokenization growth has put XRP squarely in the conversation among ETF-focused investors and network adopters.
