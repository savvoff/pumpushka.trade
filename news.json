    "title": "4 Days Left Until Best Wallet Token Presale Ends: Explosion Soon?",
    "body": "What to Know: Non-custodial wallets with integrated DeFi tools are gaining traction in 2025 as users demand control, security, and simpler multi-chain access. Best Wallet Token powers a live mobile wallet, DEX aggregator, presale launchpad, and future debit card, tying fees, rewards, and perks. The $BEST presale has raised over $17.39M at about $0.025995 per token, with dynamic staking yields and only four days left to participate. Conservative forecasts model roughly 96% potential upside by 2026, but regulatory warnings and volatility make $BEST a high-risk bet. Crypto has spent most of Q4 grinding sideways while sentiment flips between cautious and opportunistic. Bitcoin has struggled to hold recent highs, many large caps are in the red, yet activity behind the scenes has ramped up as builders double down on infrastructure, DeFi tooling, and better user experiences. One of the clearest winners of this cycle so far has been non-custodial wallets . Users want control, multi-chain access, and cleaner onboarding, not another centralized black box. New wallet launches are competing on security, UX, and integrated yield, trying to solve the pain point of juggling different apps for swapping, staking, presales, and payments. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) sits exactly at that intersection. It powers a mobile-first, non-custodial wallet that already supports dozens of blockchains, a built-in DEX aggregator, presale launchpad access, and a coming debit card that pushes crypto into day-to-day spending. The token is not just an add-on; it is wired into fees, rewards, presale access, and governance across the stack. Now the presale is entering its endgame. With more than $17.39M raised, over 55K participants, and the sale due to close on 28 November, there are only four days left for traders who want exposure at the presale price of about $0.025995. The key question is whether $BEST can justify the hype once it leaves the presale bubble and trades in the wild. Let’s take a closer look at what the wallet actually does, how the presale is structured, and what realistic upside and risk might look like for anyone considering $BEST. Best Wallet Token Marries Non Custodial UX With Real Utility Best Wallet targets a simple but powerful idea: one mobile app that lets you buy, hold, swap, track, and deploy crypto across multiple chains, without giving up custody. The wallet leans on Fireblocks MPC tech for key management, biometric login, and decentralized recovery so you’re not dealing with seed phrases written on scrap paper. On top of basic wallet functions, the app integrates Best DEX, a DEX aggregator that routes orders across 300+ decentralized exchanges and 30+ cross-chain bridges. That means you can move from, say, Ethereum to a smaller EVM chain inside one interface without juggling multiple sites and approvals. The wallet is already live, not a promise on a roadmap, which sets this presale apart from many whitepaper only launches. The $BEST token is the coordination layer for this ecosystem. Holders receive reduced swap and transaction fees, higher staking rewards through a planned staking aggregator, and governance over future features, including new chain integrations, presale listings, and advanced trading tools. The token also unlocks early access to partner presales via the Upcoming Tokens portal, effectively providing holders with a curated launchpad stream directly inside their everyday wallet. There’s also a payments angle. Best Card, now in development, is designed to let you spend $BTC, $ETH, and other major assets anywhere cards are accepted, with card cashback boosted for $BEST holders. Combined with iGaming partnerships that offer perks such as free spins and reduced withdrawal fees for token holders, the project is clearly aiming to integrate on-chain yield, payments, and real-world benefits into a single wallet-centric stack. From an infrastructure perspective, $BEST runs as an ERC 20 on Ethereum with 8% of total supply allocated to staking rewards, and it’s been audited by Coinsult with no critical issues flagged. Evaluate Best Wallet Token on fundamentals. Read our What is Best Wallet Token Guide. Best Wallet Token Presale Countdowns and ROI Scenarios The presale itself has been structured as a public sale from the outset, with no private rounds and an initial price of $0.0225, which then increased through later stages to the current $0.025995. Early tranches sold out quickly, with more than $17.39M raised and only days remaining before the 28 November cutoff and subsequent listings on DEXs and, potentially, centralized exchanges. As the presale draws to a close, whales are circling, with one dropping $13.8K into the project on Friday. On the yield side, staking has been available during the presale, with dynamic APY currently at 75%. For traders who like to farm while they wait for launch, it effectively offsets some of the opportunity cost of locking presale capital. Price projections are, of course, modeling rather than destiny, but they give a useful framework. Our $BEST forecast suggests a potential 2026 high of $0.05106175 if the wallet continues to gain users and secures solid exchange liquidity. Based on today’s presale price, that would imply a roughly 96% increase to the 2026 high if those levels are reached. Those numbers sit well below some of the more aggressive 100x style marketing headlines circulating in the presale space, offering a more sober view of what success could look like. Risk, however, is not theoretical. Best Wallet and its token operate as unregulated crypto assets. Anyone seriously considering $BEST needs to weigh the appeal of a live, feature-rich wallet ecosystem against those regulatory and market uncertainties. This is your last chance to participate at presale prices. Visit Best Wallet Token before the window closes on Friday.

    "title": "Bitcoin Hits Multimonth Lows As NYDIG Flags ‘Actual Capital Flight’",
    "body": "According to NYDIG research, the same money that pushed Bitcoin up into October’s peak is now pulling it down, and the pull looks structural rather than just emotional selling. Related Reading: Dogecoin Goes Wall Street: Grayscale Confirms Nov. 24 ETF Launch The firm’s head of research says a large liquidation in early October flipped spot ETF flows, pushed digital asset treasury (DAT) premiums lower, and coincided with a drop in stablecoin supply — a mix that points to liquidity leaving the system. ETF And Treasury Reversals Reports have disclosed that spot Bitcoin ETFs, once steady buyers, shifted from steady inflows into a meaningful headwind, while DAT premiums compressed across the market and stablecoin balances ticked down. That combination reduced the steady pool of buy-side demand that had been supporting prices. The change is what NYDIG and other market watchers call a break in the feedback loop that previously amplified gains. Bitcoin Dominance Creeps Higher As Risk Assets Unwind According to crypto market data, Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market climbed back above 60% in early November before settling around 58% as of Monday, a sign that traders are moving out of smaller, more speculative coins and into the largest, most liquid asset. That shift often happens when money tightens: capital consolidates into the biggest name as smaller positions are cut. DATs Show Cooling Demand, But No Broken Balance Sheets Based on NYDIG’s note, the DAT sector has not shown signs of insolvency. Issuers still face modest obligations and many structures allow payments to be suspended if needed. In short: demand has cooled significantly, but the frameworks that underpin many of these funds haven’t collapsed. That means the current stress is on flows and liquidity rather than on solvency. CME Gap Targeted Then A Possible Bounce Crypto analysts are watching technical levels for short-term direction. Michael van de Poppe flagged a CME gap at $85,200 as a likely downside magnet after a recent roughly 10% rise from lows, and suggested Bitcoin could then retest between $90,000 and $96,000 to form a new base. Traders watch these gaps because futures markets close over weekends while spot markets do not, creating price gaps that often get revisited. Related Reading: Kiyosaki Dumps Bitcoin At $90K After Predicting A $250K Moonshot – Here’s Why Good bounce of #Bitcoin. Nearly up 10% since the lows. CME gap at $85.2K, so probably we’ll have a casual red Monday towards that level, before we go back up to $90-96K and find a new base. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 23, 2025 Prepare For Choppy Markets Ahead Investors should note two separate ideas at once. Based on reports, the long-term story for Bitcoin — growing institutional interest and broader adoption — remains on the table. At the same time, the short-term cycle driven by flows, concentrated ETF activity, and reflexive buying has shifted. That points to an uneven path forward, with more volatile moves likely until buy-side engines reappear or fresh liquidity returns. Featured image from Gemini, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Dogecoin Just Replicated This Bullish Trend For The 3rd Time, Can Price Still Reach $1?",
    "body": "An interesting setup observed by crypto analyst Bitguru could suggest that the Dogecoin price is on the path to another major recovery. This setup has previously led to major rallies in the past, having produced similar results at two separate times. Thus, it is not a stretch that the crypto analyst expects that Dogecoin will replicate this move once the setup is complete again. Dogecoin Moving Out Of Consolidation The trend that the crypto analyst highlights has to do with the overall trend and movement of the Dogecoin price during each rally. So far, each rally seems to be mirroring the others quite closely, with the same set of things playing out each time and leading to similar outcomes. Related Reading: Top Analyst Sounds Alarm: Bitcoin Is Highly Unlikely To Spring Back Anytime Soon There are three things in total that must be completed with each rally, with the first being the Dogecoin price crashing hard into demand, and then consolidation, before finally landing a rally after finding support. This trend was first observed back in the second quarter of the year, when the Dogecoin price made its run toward the first peak for 2025. Initially, the meme coin saw its price tank rapidly, and then move into demand. The next phase was the consolidation that followed rapidly, but once the coin found its support below $0.15, the price ended up rallying by almost 100%, touching above $0.28 before proceeding downward. A similar trend was also observed in the third quarter of the year, which the analyst highlights in their chart. The same three things played out: a crash into demand, followed by consolidation, and then the support that led to the rally, with the price almost doubling as a result. Presently, the analyst explains that the Dogecoin price has now moved back toward the support level of $0.15 after the consolidation. This means that the meme coin could be on the verge of another rally. Is A 100% Increase Possible? Most times, history doesn’t repeat, but it often rhymes, and the analyst’s chart shows that this has been the case for Dogecoin this year. Given this, it is possible that this trend will hold for the meantime, meaning that the Dogecoin price could see a quick bounce after the support is established. Related Reading: XRP Approaches Macro Breakdown Zone, Analyst Warns About One Final Leg Lower If there is a similar outcome, then it could see the price double from here. With the price still trending around $0.15, it would mean that Dogecoin could rise as high as $0.3 by the time the trend is completed. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Best Crypto To Buy After $836M $BTC Strategy Bet And Fed Cut Hints",
    "body": "What to Know: Strategy’s $836M Bitcoin buy during a drawdown reinforces institutional conviction in $BTC even as volatility spikes and macro signals stay noisy. Renewed expectations for further Fed rate cuts in 2025 support the broader risk-asset case, potentially extending the current crypto cycle into next year. Wallet infrastructure, Bitcoin scaling, and stablecoin payment rails are positioned as structural winners if on-chain activity and ETF-driven adoption keep growing. Best Wallet Token, Bitcoin Hyper, and Tron each tap into those narratives with different risk profiles: high-yield presales on one side, a revenue-generating Layer-1 on the other. The crypto market just wrapped up one of its wildest weeks in months. Bitcoin slid hard early on, dragging altcoins with it as risk assets reacted to shaky macro signals and fading confidence in another Fed cut this year. Midweek, the tone flipped. Strategy revealed an $836M Bitcoin buy, adding 8,178 $BTC and taking its treasury to 649,870 $BTC – more than 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. That’s a serious ‘buy-the-dip’ statement from the biggest corporate $BTC holder and a clear signal that institutional conviction hasn’t gone anywhere, even with spot prices under pressure. On the macro side, rate-cut odds, which had been fading, started to firm again as traders repriced the chances of another move lower from the Fed. Combined with ongoing ETF flows and corporate accumulation, the narrative for December is shifting from ‘is the bull market dead?’ to ‘how much risk does one want to take on the next leg up?’ In that kind of environment, the best crypto to buy isn’t just more $BTC. Wallet infrastructure, Bitcoin scaling plays, and high-throughput stablecoin rails all stand to benefit if institutions keep stacking sats and retail comes back in size. That’s where Best Wallet Token ($BEST), Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), and Tron ($TRX) enter the conversation. 1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Self-Custody Super App With Yield Best Wallet Token ($BEST) sits at the intersection of two big trends: self-custody and ‘all-in-one’ Web3 super apps. The project’s wallet is built as a non-custodial hub where users can store assets, swap across dozens of networks, and plug into staking and DeFi without leaving a single interface. Unique to the Best Wallet app is the upcoming tokens option. This is a carefully curated and vetted selection of the best crypto presales, which you can buy directly. That means no hunting across countless sites for new presale opportunities and – most importantly – no chance of falling victim to rugpulls or other scams. The team’s ambition is aggressive: capture a 40% share of the fast-growing crypto wallet market by the end of 2026. 💰 The $BEST presale numbers suggest that vision is resonating. It has raised more than $17.3M, with a current presale price of $0.025995 per $BEST, and staking rewards at 75% APY. Consider this: according to our Best Wallet Token price prediction, $BEST has the potential to reach $0.07 by 2030. That would mean a 169.3% ROI. You don’t need to hold $BEST to enjoy the Best Wallet app’s unique features. But if you like the sound of higher staking rewards, lower transaction fees, and governance rights on the project’s direction, then now’s the time to invest in $BEST. That’s because, with just four days left until the $BEST presale ends, the window of opportunity to join one of the hottest presales of the year is closing fast. 🚀 Join the Best Wallet Token presale while you still can. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin Layer-2 With Solana-Like Performance If Bitcoin is still the asset institutions want to own, then scaling solutions around it are the leverage play. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is pitched exactly there: a Bitcoin Layer-2 that will use a canonical bridge and Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration to deliver fast, low-fee $BTC transactions and smart contracts while keeping Bitcoin as the settlement anchor. The bridge will connect Bitcoin’s Layer-1 to Hyper’s Layer-2, locking your $BTC on the base chain and minting an equivalent as wrapped $BTC on the Layer-2. The SVM, meanwhile, will provide a high-performance execution environment, bringing Solana-style parallel transaction processing, fast confirmation, and scalable smart contract capabilities. That also means developers will be able to deploy high-speed dApps (unheard of on the Bitcoin blockchain) on the Layer-2 while inheriting the efficiency and tooling of Solana’s ecosystem. 💰 Fundraising momentum has been strong, with more than $28.37M raised in the presale and staking yields around 41% on offer to early buyers. That puts Bitcoin Hyper firmly in the ‘big-ticket’ presale category for 2025. Our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction suggests a potential high of around $0.08625 by end-2026 if the Layer-2 launches on schedule and listings land on major exchanges. From a current presale price of $0.013325, that would mean a massive ROI of 547%. In a week where a single corporate treasury just added $836M in Bitcoin on a drawdown, a $BTC-centric Layer-2 that promises faster settlement and smart-contract flexibility offers a way to lean into the same thesis with more upside and more risk. 🚀 Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today. 3. Tron ($TRX) – Stablecoin Rail With Real Revenue And Deflation While presales chase future narratives, Tron ($TRX) is already one of the most used blockchains in the world. The network consistently processes thousands of transactions per second with negligible fees and has become the primary rail for $USDT transfers. 💰 Tron carries over $80B of $USDT – more than half of global supply – and regularly settles tens of billions of dollars in stablecoin volume per day. That usage shows up in the token’s fundamentals. Tron’s Delegated Proof-of-Stake design routes all transaction fees into burns, giving $TRX a net-deflationary profile when on-chain activity is strong. Recent analyses show multi-percent annual deflation as burned fees outpace new issuance, while Tron ranks among the most profitable chains by fee and revenue metrics. In parallel, the community recently approved a large network-fee cut to keep $USDT transfers cheap and defend its lead as a payments rail. At around $0.28 per token and a market cap near $26.2B, $TRX is not a micro-cap moonshot, but it offers something many Layer-1s lack: clear product-market fit around stablecoin payments and a business model that throws off real protocol revenue. In a world where rate-cut optimism and institutional $BTC buys pull liquidity back into crypto, the rails that move that liquidity for retail users – often in stablecoins – can benefit in a quieter, compounding way. 🚀 Trade $TRX on Binance and other leading exchanges. Recap: This week’s $836M Bitcoin accumulation by Strategy and a tentative shift back toward Fed rate cuts have put macro wind back in crypto’s sails. Against that backdrop, Best Wallet Token targets the self-custody wallet boom, Bitcoin Hyper aims to supercharge Bitcoin with a Layer-2, and Tron continues to monetize stablecoin flows at scale for those who prefer a more established play.

    "body": "What to Know: BitMine has bought 21,537 more $ETH for about $60M, now holding over 3% of supply despite roughly $4B in unrealized losses. The company plans a US-based MAVAN validator network to generate staking revenue and turn its massive Ethereum stack into active infrastructure. SUBBD is building an AI-powered creator content platform on Ethereum, using $SUBBD for payments, rewards, and access to automated content tools. The $SUBBD presale combines fixed 20% staking rewards with multi-x upside forecasts, but remains a high-risk early-stage Ethereum ecosystem play. BitMine has just grabbed another 21,537 Ethereum tokens for around $60M, even though it is already sitting on roughly $4B in unrealized losses on its $ETH stack. The company now controls more than 3% of the entire Ethereum supply, making it one of the most important non-foundation players anchoring the network. That is not what capitulation looks like. This fresh buy comes after Ethereum slid more than 25% in a month, putting digital asset treasuries under heavy scrutiny. $ETH is currently below $3K – howeverYet BitMine keeps saying the drawdown is a liquidity shock, not a signal that Ethereum’s fundamentals are breaking. Instead of trimming risk, it is doubling down and preparing to turn its holdings into an active business line. The firm has outlined plans for a US-based validator network called MAVAN (Made in America Validator Network), expected to go live next year and focused on staking Ethereum in a fully regulated model. The idea is simple: if you already own billions in $ETH, you might as well earn yield and become part of the network’s security backbone, rather than just watching price candles. For smaller investors who cannot spin up an industrial validator farm, this kind of move still matters. If a major treasury is willing to absorb eye-watering paper losses while building out Ethereum infrastructure, it is a strong vote of confidence in the chain that underpins most of DeFi, NFTs and, increasingly, AI-focused tokens. 💡 That is where SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) comes in, positioning itself as an AI creator platform native to Ethereum at the very moment large players are reinforcing the base layer. SUBBD Token Powers AI Creator Utilities on Ethereum SUBBD is built around a straightforward idea: creators spend far too much time on admin work and not enough time actually creating. Plus they are charged management fees that eat away at any profit they make. That’s why this project uses AI agents and automation to handle tasks like scheduling, tier management, personalized responses and analytics so that creators can focus on content while fans get a smoother experience. ⚙️ The $SUBBD token sits at the center of this ecosystem. It is used for subscription payments, tips, access to exclusive content and early access to new AI features. Holders also tap into perks such as loyalty rewards and platform benefits that are designed to keep the most engaged fans inside the ecosystem instead of bouncing between centralized platforms with high fees and opaque rules. The project’s ecosystem potentially reaches millions of followers across roughly 2K top influencers plugged into the broader SUBBD brand. That scale matters. If even a small percentage of those fans migrate to on-chain subscriptions and rewards, on-chain activity can build up quickly, especially on an Layer-1 like Ethereum, where BitMine and other big treasuries are reinforcing security via staking. The project whitepaper frames SUBBD as part of the wider creator economy, which already sits around the tens of billions of dollars in annual value. By moving fan payments, perks and AI tools on-chain, the project is trying to turn a Web2-style subscription model into a tokenized system where value accrues not just to a platform, but also to token holders and active participants. 💡 In other words, while BitMine is building ‘physical’ Ethereum infrastructure through MAVAN, SUBBD is aiming to build the application layer where human and AI ‘digital labor’ actually earns revenue. If Ethereum’s long-term story plays out the way BitMine is betting, creator platforms that live directly on the network are positioned to benefit from that same recovery. SUBBD Presale, Staking Rewards And Upside Potential The SUBBD presale is still live, with more than $1.36M already committed and the current token price at $0.057025. The sale uses incremental price steps, with a final presale rate above current levels, so early buyers effectively lock in a small discount before any exchange listings. Learn how to buy $SUBBD now to get in early. On top of that, the team is offering a fixed 20% staking reward during the presale phase. The goal here is not only to give holders passive income in $SUBBD, but also to reduce immediate sell pressure by rewarding those who lock their tokens rather than flipping them at the first listing. 💰Our $SUBBD price prediction maps a potential high of around $0.668 by the end of 2026. From the current presale level of $0.057025, that implies roughly a 12x upside. Compared with BitMine’s strategy of squeezing mid-single digit staking yields from a massive Ethereum position, smaller investors are clearly hunting for higher-gear exposure. A focused application token like $SUBBD links directly to a specific use case in the AI creator economy, while still inheriting the macro thesis that Ethereum remains the settlement layer of choice. Join the SUBBD Token presale before the next price hike.

    "title": "Why XRP Price Crash Below $2 Is Not A Problem – $20 Is Still The Target",
    "body": "XRP has endured a difficult stretch in recent days, falling below the $2 level after a sequence of heavy selling. Price volatility across Bitcoin and other major assets added fuel to the drop, dragging XRP to lows around $1.92 and shaking the short-term sentiment of many traders. However, several XRP supporters are still of the notion that this move is far from a cause for concern. One of the most vocal is an analyst operating under the name @WillyWonkaXRP on the social media platform X, who insisted that the dip does not alter the long-term trajectory. From his perspective, the current environment is still laying the foundation for a far higher valuation due to institutional takeovers. Crash Below $2 Is Not A Problem The analyst’s evaluation is based on the outlook that XRP is transitioning into a more structurally mature phase, highlighted by regulation, banking partnerships, and expanding utility. He pointed to recent approvals that removed long-standing legal uncertainties and to the growth of Ripple’s enterprise network, which now boasts more than 300 banking partners in over 40 countries. Related Reading: XRP Price Has Surged 15% Anytime This Metric Appeared In The Past The analyst also highlighted the rollout of Ripple’s Liquidity Hub, the expansion of the RLUSD stablecoin, and the rising expectations for additional Spot XRP ETFs. In his view, these developments show that large-scale institutional integration is happening quietly beneath the short-term market noise, making the recent dip to $1.92 insignificant relative to a longer-term path he believes stretches well beyond $20. Speaking of price action, the XRP price fell to as low as $1.88 on November 21, according to CoinGecko. The chart accompanying the analyst’s post illustrates a long multi-year structure in which XRP repeatedly formed broad accumulation ranges before breaking above resistance. The pattern displayed across years shows several failed attempts at the same horizontal ceiling before eventually giving way. The current price action now puts XRP retesting from above. The pullback to the region around $2 corresponds almost exactly with this retest zone, which shows that the price is returning to confirm support rather than a breakdown of the larger trend. What Would It Take For XRP To Reach $20? An XRP price rally to $20 would require a combination of technical follow-through and continued institutional participation. With the current circulating supply hovering around 60 billion tokens, a clean run to $20 would lift XRP’s market capitalization to about US $1.2 trillion. Related Reading: Analyst Claims XRP Price Will Surge To $220 Due To ETFs, But Is This Possible? Technically, XRP would need to maintain its hold above $2.00, as this level now serves as the anchor for any long-term bullish trajectory. Fundamentally, increased ETF inflows, growth of RLUSD, and greater adoption of RippleNet by global financial institutions would strengthen demand for XRP and create the needed buying pressure. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.07, up by 2.4% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Attack On Cardano Founder Leads To Network Halt, What Really Happened?",
    "body": "Cardano faced an unexpected shock when a corrupted transaction aimed at Charles Hoskinson’s personal stake pool caused the network to split for several hours. The incident triggered confusion, exposed weaknesses, and sparked a heated clash over motive and responsibility. Here is how a single action spiraled into a full-scale disruption. Cardano Founder Targeted, Network Shaken The Cardano network faced unexpected disruption on November 21, 2025, after an incident targeting the founder’s personal stake pool. What began as a ‘test’ by a stake pool operator quickly escalated into a risky experiment on the main network, where he reportedly followed unverified AI-generated instructions and submitted a malformed transaction. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Why He’s Not Worried About XRP Price – ‘The Road To Valhala The transaction exploited an obscure 2022 cryptographic library bug, causing newer nodes to parse it incorrectly while older nodes rejected it. This triggered a chain split, disrupted block production, and left validators, DeFi protocols, and everyday users struggling to stay aligned for several hours. The operator later admitted that the entire situation was the result of poor judgment, one he described as a personal challenge he handled recklessly. He insisted he had no financial motives, no collaborators, and no intention to target the founder. His message expressed regret for the disruption caused to stake pool operators and developers who had to react immediately. Many operators lost block rewards, and some decentralized applications experienced inconsistent states. While user funds remained safe, the event revealed how one misstep could trigger a chain-wide disturbance. Hoskinson Says It Was Personal And Months In The Making Despite the stake pool operator claiming no intention of harm, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson rejected the idea that this was an accidental mistake. He stated that the individual responsible had been active in online groups known for hostility toward Cardano and its leadership. According to him, the attacker had spent months discussing ways to disrupt the project’s operations and reputation. Hoskinson pointed out that his personal pool was the direct target. For him, this proved the act was intentional, not an experiment gone wrong. He emphasized that the disruption touched every user on the network, causing stake pool operators to miss earnings, parts of the DeFi ecosystem to stall, and Cardano developers to be forced into rapid emergency fixes. Related Reading: Barstools Founder Just Made A Million-Dollar Investment In XRP, Does He Know Something? He also stated that law enforcement had already stepped in, turning the event into a criminal matter. In his view, the public apology surfaced only after community investigators linked the operator to the incident and federal involvement became clear. The incident left the community divided between two narratives: one of reckless experimentation and one of calculated sabotage. What remains certain is that a targeted hit—intentional or not—exposed how quickly a malformed transaction can fracture the system and force an entire ecosystem into crisis mode. Cardano recovered, but the questions raised by this attack will continue to shape how the network prepares for the next potential threat.

    "title": "XRP Real Purpose: Documentation Shows Payment Utility Contrary To Viral Claims — Details",
    "body": "The viral claims suggesting that XRP has no connection to payments are quickly falling apart under a basic review of official documentation. As misinformation spreads across social platforms, the publicly available documentation continues to reinforce the asset’s real, payment-centric utility, contradicting the narrative gaining traction online. How Documentation Debunks The XRP Role Speculation In an X post, a researcher known as SMQKE has revealed that the narrative claim that XRP is just a cryptocurrency with no connection to traditional finance payments is sharply contradicted by the documentation that defines the asset. A surface-level review has already shown just how inaccurate that statement is. Related Reading: Something Big Coming For XRP? Ripple Engineer Reveals Major Development According to SMQKE, unlike many cryptocurrencies built purely for decentralized experimentation, XRP was designed to operate within the existing traditional finance system. The report highlights that XRP was intended to enhance international money transfers by serving as a neutral bridge between currencies and providing liquidity. Furthermore, the documentation also shows that XRP is a digital asset engineered specifically to address long-standing inefficiencies in the traditional payment system. The conversation around RippleNet isn’t about experiments. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull highlighted that more than 300 banks are not testing RippleNet; they are partnering with it. Brad Garlinghouse isn’t speaking in vague possibilities; instead, he is forecasting where XRP could capture up to 14% of current SWIFT volume by 2030, which is an estimated $21 trillion in annual value moving across the XRP Ledger infrastructure. His focus is not on the chart price movements. It’s about how global financial plumbing is being re-engineered in real-time. The idea centers on a system where banks could settle cross-border transactions instantly 24/7, with lower operational fees, all powered by XRP. From this perspective, the transformation is being built. While the retail traders often react to every red candle, the institutions are entering partnerships and signing integrations. “You don’t buy XRP for today. You buy it for the financial world that is coming,” Xfinancebull noted. Major Capital Shifts From Observing To Building A recent move from Ripple has shifted conversations entirely. XFBAcademy has pointed out that banks didn’t raise $500 million to reshape the future of money, but Ripple did. Moves like this indicate exactly why the long-term outlook around XRP will continue to build strength. Meanwhile, real utility is finally being funded at the highest institutional levels. Related Reading: Ripple Exec Addresses Tax Issue On XRP Ledger, Where Does It Go? XFBAcademy explains that when names like Fortress, Citadel, Pantera, Brevan Howard, and Galaxy participate simultaneously, it’s not speculation, but a signal where infrastructure is heading. This raise isn’t fueled by speculative propaganda. Instead, it is tied to RLUSD, institutional rails, and the treasuries moving into on-chain. This kind of capital doesn’t chase existing narratives but actively builds new ones. The expert frames moments like these as the real turning points. These are the junctures when the smartest money transitions from observation to funding the new plumbing of global finance. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Price Action With Chinese Astrology Shares When Prices Will Surge",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Crypto Waterman, who predicted the Bitcoin price action with Chinese Astrology, has revealed when the flagship crypto will surge alongside altcoins. This comes as BTC looks to rebound from its recent crash to as low as $81,000. Analyst Reveals When The Bitcoin Price Will Surge In an X post, Crypto Waterman predicted that the Bitcoin price would surge from December 5 after it bottoms between November 28 and 29, when Mercury retrograde ends. He further remarked that there will be high swings up and down between November 29 and December 5, noting that the current market action is similar to mid-July 2021 in the previous cycle. Related Reading: Analyst Who Sold Bitcoin At $102,000 Predicts Crash To $40,000, But There’s Something Else The crypto analyst stated that the Bitcoin price rise will happen from December 5 to December 18 for two weeks, with the relief rally sending BTC to between $100,000 and $110,000. Once that happens, he predicts a three-week dip from December 18 to January 6, which will push BTC down to between $90,000 and $100,000. After the dip, Crypto Waterman predicts that the Bitcoin price will rise from December 6 to mid-February, hitting a new all-time high (ATH) during that period. He expects the flagship crypto to rally to between $140,000 and $145,000. Notably, the crypto analyst has so far accurately predicted the November BTC price action, which he claimed was with the help of Chinese astrology. Based on this, the crypto analyst is confident that the Bitcoin price is about to have its final leg in this bull market cycle. He also expects altcoins to witness one final rally to the upside, predicting that altseason should happen between January and February. Crypto Waterman also revealed that he plans to exit most of his bags in mid-February or the beginning of March as the market enters the horse year. ‘Too Early’ To Call For New ATH Crypto analyst Colin has indicated that it is too early to predict that the Bitcoin price could reach a new all-time high. This follows the recent BTC rebound from its lows of around $81,000 last week. The analyst explained that a bounce was inevitable after the flagship crypto was so oversold. However, he isn’t flipping macro bullish on expecting a new ATH too quickly. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Suffer 40% Crash From All-Time High? Analyst Reveals ‘Final Target’ The analyst further remarked that such a bounce says nothing about new ATHs and that BTC must reclaim major key levels well above current levels to have a chance of reaching new ATHs. He added that he expects the Bitcoin price to reach $100,000 on this bounce, but that won’t mean that a new ATH is in sight. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $87,500, up almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "CEO Reveals Ripple’s XRP Is Driving A JPMorgan Competitor, Is SWIFT Next?",
    "body": "The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Teucrium Trading, Sal Gilbertie, has given a bold endorsement of Ripple and XRP, positioning the crypto payments company as a potential competitor to JPMorgan Chase. He described Ripple as a highly interconnected ecosystem that could scale globally once it acquires a banking license. As Ripple grows to challenge the largest bank in the US, it raises the question about how its rapidly expanding network could also rival legacy banking systems like SWIFT. Ripple Positioned As New JPMorgan And SWIFT Rival Crypto enthusiast and XRP advocate Diana recently shared a striking interview between Paul Barron, founder of the Paul Barron Network, and Gilbertie. In the interview, the Teucrium Trading CEO shared his perspective on Ripple, showing full support for the crypto payment company’s growth and future potential. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Predicts XRP Rush, What Does He Mean? He explained that Ripple is actively building a fully operational financial institution capable of rivaling traditional banking giants like JPMorgan. The crypto payments company has also frequently been described as a competitor to SWIFT, positioning itself as a faster and more efficient alternative for cross-border payments. Gilbertie stressed that once Ripple obtains a banking license, it would operate with the capitalization and operational discipline typically associated with top-tier banks. Notably, the crypto payments company has been seeking a US national banking charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to establish a new national trust bank. If authorized, Ripple could become one of the first crypto-native companies to obtain a US national bank license. Moving forward, Gilbertie said during the interview that XRP lies at the heart of this growing banking ecosystem. He noted that Ripple has no intention of selling XRP, describing the cryptocurrency as a strategic asset whose value is intended to appreciate over time through its use across the XRPL ecosystem. The Teucrium Trading CEO also called Ripple a “machine,” highlighting how the company operates in a disciplined, coordinated way, with its team growing and innovating while keeping the network strong and connected. Furthermore, he boldly claimed that Ripple is at the center of the universe, underscoring its pivotal role in potentially shaping the global banking landscape. Gilbertie’s Validation Confirms XRP’s Role The interview between Gilbertie and Barron drew strong, supportive reactions from many members of the crypto community, who interpreted the Teucrium Trading CEO’s statement as validation of XRP’s evolving role in institutional finance. Observers noted that hearing a regulated TradFi CEO describe Ripple as a JPMorgan rival offered rare institutional recognition that went beyond the usual industry speculation. Related Reading: Ripple Exec Addresses Tax Issue On XRP Ledger, Where Does It Go? They also pointed out that the timing of this endorsement coincides with the upcoming full enforcement of ISO 20022 standards and rising XRP ETF inflows. Diana, the XRP advocate who shared the interview, echoed this view, emphasizing that Gilbertie’s statements signal that infrastructure, compliance, and institutional interest are all aligning. She noted that price movements typically follow institutional and infrastructure rails, suggesting that XRP may be positioned for substantial growth once these rails are fully in place.

    "body": "XRP’s market momentum accelerated this week as the cryptocurrency hit a key bullish target identified by a prominent trader, reinforcing growing confidence across the community. Related Reading: Will The Low XRP Price Force Ripple To Dump Its Holdings? Exec Answers Community The surge comes amid a wave of institutional inflows, multiple ETF launches, expanding utility, and renewed optimism from analysts who believe XRP is entering a powerful new phase of market participation. XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Technical Breakout: Bull Flag Target Achieved A precise technical call from trader @kriptocumm caught the attention of XRP traders after the asset reached the exact bull flag target he outlined earlier in the week. KripTocuM’s analysis, shared on November 22, identified a textbook flag pattern with support at $1.8810 and a breakout requirement above $1.92. Using the pole height of roughly $1.37 added to the breakout point, he calculated a target of $2.1076. On November 24, XRP rallied past $2, coming within striking distance of the projected level, before stabilizing near $2.055. Trading volume jumped to $3.85 billion, reflecting heightened market participation and validating the breakout structure. Indicators remained tilted bullish, with RSI at 62 and a positive MACD crossover suggesting further upside potential. XRP ETF Momentum Pushes Institutional Demand Higher XRP’s move arrives during one of its strongest weeks of institutional interest to date. Franklin Templeton’s newly approved spot XRP ETF (XRPZ) debuted on the NYSE with projected first-day volumes of up to $30 million. The fund’s aggressive fee-waiver strategy, 0% on the first $5 billion until May 2026, has already drawn investor attention. Grayscale also launched its XRP Trust ETF (GXRP) with a temporary 0% fee, expanding access for traditional market participants seeking regulated exposure. Both products entered the market as XRP recorded $179.6 million in weekly inflows, sharply contrasting heavy outflows from Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Analysts say this rotation signals a shift toward altcoins with clearer catalysts and strengthening fundamentals. Analysts See Expanding Utility and Long-Term Upside Growing utility narratives continue to enhance XRP’s appeal. CryptoSensei recently reiterated explosive price projections, conditional on supply constraints, while pointing to rising institutional adoption, expanding treasury use, and new stablecoin-related integrations as key pillars for long-term growth. Meanwhile, Ripple’s new Asian banking partnership and ongoing XRPL scalability upgrades are adding further confidence to XRP’s fundamental outlook.

    "body": "Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim momentum as it trades below the critical $90,000 level, with selling pressure dominating the market and fear spreading rapidly. Many analysts are leaning toward calling the start of a new bear market, arguing that Bitcoin likely topped in early October near $126,000. Momentum has weakened sharply since then, and investor behavior now reflects a shift toward risk-off positioning. Related Reading: Anti-CZ Whale Loses Big: $61M in Profit Wiped Out As Ethereum and XRP Longs Collapse A new report from CryptoOnchain, published via CryptoQuant, highlights one of the most significant developments of this cycle: a historic 63,000 BTC has moved from long-term holders (LTHs) to short-term holders (STHs). This unprecedented transfer is clearly visible in the Long-Term Holder Net Position Change chart, which shows a massive red bar — a negative daily difference signaling heavy outflows from long-term holder wallets. This type of behavior typically appears during late-stage bull markets or near local and cycle tops, when long-time investors with substantial profit margins begin realizing gains. At the same time, the corresponding Short-Term Holder Net Position Change chart shows a huge green bar, confirming that newer, more reactive market participants are buying these coins, often at elevated prices. Long-Term Holders Distribute as Short-Term Buyers Absorb Supply CryptoOnchain explains that the current market structure is being shaped by a clear divergence in behavior between Long-Term Holders (LTHs) and Short-Term Holders (STHs). LTHs — historically considered the “strong hands” of the market — are now heavily distributing, sending large amounts of Bitcoin into the market after months or even years of holding. At the same time, STHs are aggressively buying and accumulating this supply, often entering positions at elevated prices despite growing volatility. This dynamic is not inherently a bearish signal on its own. In fact, such transitions are common during late-stage bull markets, where early investors secure profits while new participants enter the market with fresh capital. It reflects a natural rotation of supply from experienced holders to newer ones, a pattern seen repeatedly in previous cycles. However, the volume of distribution is significant, and it raises an important risk: if incoming demand fails to fully absorb the coins being offloaded by LTHs, the market could face a deeper correction or extended consolidation phase. This supply pressure can weigh on price, especially in a context where sentiment is fragile and macro conditions remain uncertain. Related Reading: STH Panic Emerges as Bitcoin Crashes To $81K: Realized P/L Turns Negative For The First Time This Cycle Weekly Chart Signals a Critical Retest of Macro Support Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize around the $87,000 level after an intense multi-week sell-off that dragged price as low as $85,946. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin has now tapped the 100-week moving average (green line), a historically important support level during bull-market retracements. This line acted as a springboard in previous cycles, but the current bounce remains weak and indecisive, reflecting the fear dominating the market. Momentum has clearly shifted bearish. The breakdown from the $110K–$100K consolidation zone triggered accelerated selling, confirming a loss of market structure on the weekly timeframe. Candles over the past three weeks show high-volume distribution, with sellers overwhelming demand each time Bitcoin attempted to reclaim higher levels. The steep slope of the 50-week MA turning slightly down is another sign that trend strength has softened.

Bulls aggressively defended this area in prior macro corrections, and holding above $83K–$86K keeps the long-term bull structure intact. A weekly close below this zone, however, opens the door to deeper downside toward the 200-week MA near $56K–$60K. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Hedera (HBAR) is kicking off the week with a strong burst of momentum, climbing more than 5% in the past 24 hours to trade around $0.14. Related Reading: Will The Low XRP Price Force Ripple To Dump Its Holdings? Exec Answers Community The wider crypto market is finally flashing green, but the HBAR price is clearly outpacing the pack thanks to a wave of institutional interest, rising ETF inflows, and growing excitement ahead of Coinbase’s futures launch. Still, despite the bullish sentiment, chart signals warn that the token isn’t out of danger just yet. HBAR's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: HBARUSD on Tradingview ETF Inflows, Futures Launch Fuel the Rally The sudden HBAR price acceleration comes at a moment when multiple catalysts are stacking in its favor. Trading volume has surged by more than 190%, pushing Hedera into the top gainer bracket of the day. A major driver is Coinbase’s upcoming rollout of 24/7 HBAR futures trading on December 5, which opens the door for more institutional hedging, speculation, and liquidity. The ETF space is also turning increasingly supportive. Canary Capital’s HBAR ETF has boosted its holdings to over 421 million HBAR, now valued at nearly $55 million, after three straight sessions of positive net inflows. Since its launch, the ETF has attracted over $72 million, a rare trend during a period when other major crypto funds, particularly those focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum, have experienced significant outflows. Additionally, the IRS’s new stance allowing staking inside ETFs and the SEC’s updated listing standards have brightened the long-term outlook for HBAR-based investment products. Meanwhile, real-world adoption narratives are strengthening thanks to Wyoming’s stablecoin pilot on Hedera and tokenized ETF assets deployed. HBAR Price Bullish Setup, But Still Below Key Trendlines Technically, the HBAR price is showing early signs of a possible reversal. Analysts highlight a triple bottom pattern forming around the $0.123 zone, an area buyers have defended multiple times this year. Rising futures open interest and an improving long/short ratio add to the bullish backdrop. However, Hedera remains trapped beneath a dominant descending trendline that has rejected every rally since September. The 20-day EMA at $0.155 continues to cap upside attempts, while the 50- and 100-day EMAs reinforce heavy resistance above. Momentum indicators have improved, but the broader trend remains bearish unless the HBAR price decisively breaks above $0.155. Short-Term Outlook: Cautious Optimism If buyers maintain pressure, the HBAR price could retest the $0.16–$0.18 region. A clean breakout above the falling channel would set the stage for a larger move toward $0.228, the neckline of the triple bottom. But failure to overcome resistance keeps the token vulnerable to retracements toward $0.14, then $0.125, and potentially $0.10 if bearish momentum resurfaces.

    "title": "JPMorgan’s Alleged Short On Strategy (MSTR): How A 50% Price Jump Could Spell Major Troubles",
    "body": "Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, the largest public holder of Bitcoin (BTC), finds itself at the center of a stormy controversy involving JPMorgan as Bitcoin prices continue to struggle. With signs of a potential bear market emerging, fresh rumors suggest that one of the world’s largest banks allegedly holds a significant short position on Strategy’s stock (MSTR), which has plunged 69% from its record high of $543 per share last year. Strategy Faces Potential MSCI Exclusion The turmoil escalated last week when JPMorgan issued a warning that Strategy might soon be removed from major equity indices, specifically the MSCI USA Index. JPMorgan’s analysts noted that the issues facing Strategy extend beyond the recent downturn in cryptocurrency prices, which have seen Bitcoin fall more than 30% from its all-time highs. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading around $86,000, while the broader crypto market has experienced a staggering $1 trillion decline in total market capitalization over the past month. Related Reading: Why XRP Price Crash Below $2 Is Not A Problem – $20 Is Still The Target JPMorgan’s analysts indicated that MSCI is considering whether companies with over 50% of their total assets in digital currencies should qualify for inclusion in traditional equity indices. Given that Strategy’s balance sheet is heavily weighted with Bitcoin, it is at significant risk of exclusion. The analysts stated that “MicroStrategy [is] at risk of exclusion from major equity indices as the January 15th MSCI decision approaches.” They speculated that removal from the MSCI could trigger approximately $2.8 billion in outflows, and if other index providers follow MSCI’s lead, the total could reach as high as $8.8 billion. The situation is complicated by market dynamics, particularly the timing of JPMorgan’s bearish note, which coincided with Bitcoin’s weakness and MSTR’s decline, all while liquidity was thin and overall sentiment fragile. JPMorgan Faces Account Closures Surge According to analysts at the Bull Theory, JPMorgan has been noted for timing its market reports—bearing down when prices are already weak and striking a more bullish tone near market peaks. The analysts have highlighted that share lending for MSTR has reportedly increased, allowing brokers to lend shares to short sellers, which can exacerbate downward pressure on the stock price. Additionally, there are escalating reports of widespread account closures at JPMorgan, with thousands claiming to have exited due to perceived manipulation of both MSTR and Bitcoin. Related Reading: A Quiet Move In Bitcoin Options Is Starting To Raise Big Questions Amid these developments, the fear of a potential short squeeze is growing. The analysts believe that if Strategy’s stock were to rally around 40% to 50%, it could trigger a short squeeze in the bank’s position and spell major financial troubles. In response, Michael Saylor, the CEO of Strategy, has sought to clarify the company’s identity, emphasizing that it is not just a passive Bitcoin holder. He pointed out that Strategy operates as a software business with an active financial strategy, countering the narrative circulating around MSCI’s concerns. As the situation unfolds, several key points emerge. The October 10th crash appeared to align with the MSCI announcement, coinciding with an already fragile market state. JP Morgan’s strategic timing of its bearish insights has amplified existing fears, creating further uncertainty as MSCI’s final decision looms.
