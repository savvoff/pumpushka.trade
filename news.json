    "title": "Dogecoin Enters Crucial Accumulation Zone — DOGE Price To $0.2?",
    "body": "After a difficult end to 2025, the altcoin market looks set to take the lead in the new year, being the most significant beneficiary from the recent post-holiday rally. Dogecoin, the largest meme coin by market capitalization, has jumped by nearly 24% since the turn of the year. According to the latest on-chain data, the price of Dogecoin appears to be in a critical region at the moment. The relevance of this zone suggests that the meme coin may be merely at the start of an extended upward trend over the next few months. Is It Time To Buy DOGE? In a January 3 post on X, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson said that Dogecoin has entered its most important accumulation zone. This on-chain observation is based on the recent changes in the CVDD (Cumulative Value Days Destroyed) Channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio Flips Into Negative Territory— Is The Recovery Back On? For context, the CVDD Channel is an on-chain indicator that tracks the volume of aged capital being sent into the market (Dogecoin, in this case). This metric is typically used in highlighting zones of long-term support or resistance based on the movement of aged coins on-chain. Wedson highlighted in his post that the CVDD channels depend on Fibonacci-based levels on top of the CVDD curve. This metric creates historical value zones where price tends to react; with the blue CVDD lines, for instance, acting as strong structural support for the price of Dogecoin. As observed in the chart above, DOGE’s recent surge to around $0.15 came after its price bounced from the first blue level. In essence, these lower blue levels have historically proven to be good support cushions for the Dogecoin price. According to Wedson, the lower CVDD Fibonacci zones often coincide with long-term accumulation phases for Dogecoin. Hence, it might be time to accumulate the meme coin, especially as its price is wedged within the blue CVDD zones. Dogecoin Price Outlook 2026 As of this writing, the price of DOGE stands at around 0.1415, reflecting an over 2% jump in the past 24 hours. A broader look at the chart shows that Dogecoin seems to be heating up at the moment. According to data from CoinGecko, the meme coin’s value has increased by more than 15% in the last seven days.

One Of The ‘Greatest Blessings’ We’ll See In Our Lifetime, Analyst Says Following its red-hot action to kickstart the new year, the price of Dogecoin looks set for a positive run in 2026. Moreover, the altcoin market is being tipped to outperform Bitcoin this year. Hence, a renewed bullish momentum and a long-overdue altcoin season could have the DOGE price reaching new highs in 2026.

    "title": "Crypto Users Lose Far Less To Phishing As Losses Drop 83% – Details",
    "body": "Crypto phishing losses plunged in 2025, but experts warn the threat has only changed shape rather than disappeared. Reports show a sharp fall in money stolen by wallet-draining scams, even as attackers tested new tricks tied to recent protocol changes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Altcoins Post Another Losing Year: Analyst Scam Sniffer Data Shows Drop According to Scam Sniffer’s 2025 analysis, wallet drainer phishing losses fell to about $83.85 million — an 83% decline from roughly $494 million in 2024. The number of affected wallets dropped to around 106,000, a fall of about 68% year-on-year. These figures come from the security platform’s annual study and were picked up by major crypto outlets. Attackers Shift, Not Stop Only 11 incidents topped $1 million in 2025, down from 30 the prior year, signaling fewer headline grabs but a rise in smaller hits. The largest single theft recorded last year was roughly $6.5 million, tied to a malicious Permit signature attack. Average losses per victim fell to roughly $790, which suggests attackers moved toward more frequent, lower-value strikes. Market Moves Mattered Losses followed market activity. The third quarter logged the highest damage at about $31 million, when Ethereum’s rally brought more users and approvals onchain. Monthly peaks included August, which posted about $12.17 million, while December was the quietest with roughly $2 million. That pattern shows fraudsters target busy trading windows. 1/ Ever woken up to an empty crypto wallet? With scammers draining $107K+ across EVM chains JUST THIS WEEK (per @zachxbt), it’s scarier than ever! Shoutout to @realscamsniffer for their 2025 report – losses down 83%, but threats are evolving FAST. Let’s recap & warn on 2026… https://t.co/uSerpsg80d — JP (@rugpullfinder) January 3, 2026 Permit Signatures And New Vectors Reports highlighted Permit and Permit2 signature abuses as a major driver of big losses, accounting for a large share of multi-million cases. Scam Sniffer also flagged EIP-7702 batch signature techniques that were used in a few complex attacks after network upgrades. Security teams say these methods exploit user approval flows rather than raw smart-contract bugs. Why The Drop Happened Analysts attribute much of the improvement to better wallet warnings, wider use of approval revocation tools, and more active tracking by onchain monitors. Some defenders also point to reduced market froth in parts of the year, which lowered the pool of high-value targets. Still, multiple outlets stress that reduced totals do not equal safety. Related Reading: A Maduro Bet, A Market Alarm: US Lawmaker Targets Trading Abuses Based on reports, phishing will likely remain cyclical: losses could spike again during big rallies or when new signing features are introduced. Security firms urge users to check approvals, avoid blind signing, and use wallet tools that flag risky requests. Regulators and exchanges are watching the trend, but responsibility for many attacks still falls to individual users and wallet software. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "$18 Million Ethereum Loss Sends Whale Running To Gold",
    "body": "A large crypto wallet that recently took a sharp loss on Ethereum has restructured its holdings, moving away from volatile tokens and increasing exposure to stablecoins and tokenized gold, according to on-chain tracking data. Related Reading: A Maduro Bet, A Market Alarm: US Lawmaker Targets Trading Abuses The address drew attention after an aggressive Ethereum purchase late last year went wrong. Between November 3 and November 7, 2025, the wallet spent about $110 million to acquire 31,005 ETH at an average price of $3,581. As prices slid, the position was unwound. Nearly the entire holding was sold for roughly $92.19 million, locking in a loss close to $18 million within two weeks. At current prices near $3,020, that same Ethereum stack would now be valued at around $93.6 million. Shift Away From Ether After Costly Exit Based on reports from blockchain monitoring platforms, the sell-off marked a clear change in behavior. The wallet, once heavily tied to Ethereum, no longer holds a large directional bet on the asset. Instead, balances have been spread across cash-like tokens and commodities. The move reflects caution rather than an attempt to quickly recover losses. An unknown whale, who lost $18.8M on $ETH in just 2 weeks, has abandoned $ETH and rotated into #gold. The whale has spent $14.58M to buy 3,299 $XAUT at $4,421 over the past 7 hours.https://t.co/hit6agWmHd pic.twitter.com/X7k94zV0iQ — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 2, 2026 Gold Buying Shows Preference For Lower Volatility According to on-chain records, the address began building a position in Tether’s tokenized gold product, XAUT. Starting on Friday, the wallet spent $14.58 million in USDT to buy 3,299 XAUT across several transactions. The average purchase price came in near $4,421 per token. This was not the first gold buy. A smaller XAUT acquisition was made on December 13, roughly three weeks earlier. As of the latest data, the wallet holds 3,386 XAUT tokens worth about $14.92 million. The broader portfolio now totals close to $91 million. About $58 million sits in USDT, another $18 million is held in USDC, while the remainder is split between XAUT and a reduced Ethereum balance. The composition points to capital protection rather than high-risk positioning. Metals Outperform Crypto In 2025 Returns from last year help explain the change. Reports have disclosed that Bitcoin fell by 6% in 2025, while Ethereum dropped 11%. Over the same period, gold surged over 60%, and silver rose an even steeper 147%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Altcoins Post Another Losing Year: Analyst Major stock indexes such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq 100 also posted stronger performance than much of the crypto market. With those results in view, some investors appear more comfortable holding assets linked to metals or cash. Meanwhile, analysts at asset manager VanEck have pointed to 2026 as a possible recovery year for the crypto market. Their view contrasts with the current behavior of large wallets moving into stablecoins and gold-linked tokens. The divide shows how uncertain sentiment remains after a year when metals and traditional assets delivered stronger gains than major cryptocurrencies.

    "body": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) has ridden a fresh wave of speculative buying this week, with the token jumping nearly 20% while the broader meme coin sector surged. Related Reading: $18 Million Ethereum Loss Sends Whale Running To Gold According to Santiment, total meme coin valuation rose by about 23% over the period as traders piled back into higher-risk tokens. Trading volumes jumped from $2.16 billion to roughly $8.6 billion, a whopping increase that shows how fast money rotated into this corner of the market. Supply Concentration Raises Eyebrows Reports have disclosed that supply remains highly concentrated among a handful of wallets. The top 10 holders control over 60% of SHIB’s maximum supply, which equals around 1 quadrillion tokens. 🐶📈 Meme coins, the most “speculative” of assets, have proceeded with their post-holiday run. The entire meme market cap is now above $45.3B, growing by +20.8% in just the past week. 📊 Notable 7-day gainers include: 🪙 $PEPE +54% 🪙 $USELESS +54% 🪙 $MOG +38% 🪙 $DOG +36% 🪙… pic.twitter.com/htdfiXLaLf — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 4, 2026 Those wallets together hold about 630 trillion SHIB. Based on Santiment’s figures, the official burn wallet alone holds roughly 40% of the total supply, a stake valued at over $3 billion. This kind of concentration can magnify price swings if large holders move coins onto exchanges or sell. Technical Setup Points To A Test Analyst Charting Guy flagged the token’s weekly chart as “looking good” in a January 4 tweet, noting a strong weekly candle that closed up 22%. Based on reports, SHIB started 2026 at $0.000006904 and has since pushed higher. $SHIB weekly looks good pic.twitter.com/YigTTQ3kEW — Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) January 4, 2026 The meme coin briefly traded above $0.0000093 before a pullback and is currently around $0.000008766. Year-to-date gains sit near 32% and the token was up 5.14% over the past 24 hours and 17.31% over the last week. Charting Guy’s chart shows SHIB approaching the tip of a long-running descending trendline that traces back to a high of $0.0000334 in December 2024. A break above that line would raise the chance of a larger move higher. Meme Coins See Wide Gains Other tokens have also posted big moves. Dogecoin recorded about a 20% rise while Pepe surged roughly 65% over the same span. The group’s sharp gains came as speculative interest accelerated and traders chased short-term returns. Related Reading: A Maduro Bet, A Market Alarm: US Lawmaker Targets Trading Abuses Market Volume And Trader Behavior Santiment’s data highlights that trading activity spiked dramatically, signaling a swift return of hot money to meme coins. The jump from $2.17 billion to $8.7 billion in daily traded value shows more participants are active and willing to take bigger risks. Based on the mix of heavy supply concentration and a crowded technical setup, Shiba Inu’s path could widen in either direction. A decisive breakout above the descending trendline might extend last week’s rally, while heavy selling from large wallets could trigger sharp pullbacks.

    "title": "XRP Is Setting Up For Its ‘Next Explosive Move,’ Analysts Say: Here’s The Target",
    "body": "XRP is approaching a decision point across the monthly and daily charts, with renowned crypto analysts The Great Mattsby (Matt Hughes) and Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) framing the current structure as a volatility-compression setup that could resolve higher if key high-timeframe supports continue to hold. XRP Price Poised For ‘Explosive Move’ Mattsby’s core claim is that XRP has defended its long-term trend support and is now coiling for expansion. “XRP had a perfect bounce off the 20-month MA, while the upper and lower bands continue to contract—setting up for its next explosive move higher,” he wrote, adding: “It’s crazy how many people are bearish right at major high-time-frame support.” On the monthly chart, XRP is shown trading around $2.08629, sitting above the Bollinger basis near 1.89623, with the upper band labeled at $3.57705 and the lower band at $0.21541. The visual takeaway is the squeeze: the band envelope has tightened materially compared with prior periods, a condition Mattsby ties to “explosive” directional follow-through when it resolves. Related Reading: Jake Claver Doubles Down On $100 XRP Target After 2025 Miss The other important input on that panel is the 20-month moving average, which Mattsby highlights as the pivot. His October framing leans on historical rhyme: “XRP is repeating what it did back in 2017. Consolidate sideways for months until it touched the 20month MA. After that, it shot up to finish off the cycle.” In his view, the touch-and-hold dynamic is already in place this cycle, even if it’s “taking a little longer.” With the October 10 liquidation event, XRP pierced the 20-month moving average and has since consolidated above it. If that read holds, the most explicit upside reference on-chart is the monthly Bollinger upper band around $3.57705, a level that would represent a return to the top of the current volatility envelope rather than an open-ended projection. Wyckoff-Style Re-Accumulation Points To $8 Charting Guy’s daily chart overlays a Wyckoff-style roadmap and labels the sequence as a re-accumulation that transitions into markup. The yellow projection assumes XRP is still working through overhead supply, with the ~$2.08 area (marked by the blue horizontal line and aligned with the current print) acting as the immediate gatekeeper. In that framing, $2.08 is not a comfort-zone support level yet; it is a level XRP needs to reclaim decisively and then stay above on retests for the bullish sequence to keep validating. Related Reading: XRP Faces Strong Social Discontent—Is A 50% Bullish Reversal Just Around The Corner? A second constraint on the chart is the descending channel, the “creek” structure that defined the current downtrend. Charting Guy expects that XRP will rally towards the upper trendline resistance, followed by a controlled pullback labeled “test,” where price checks whether demand is real and whether sellers can still force acceptance back into the old range. If that test holds (another short-lived dip below $2.08 is fine), the roadmap then looks for an “LPS” (last point of support): a higher low that signals supply is being absorbed. Only after that does the yellow path call for “JATC” (jump across the creek), the clean breakout through the channel, followed by “SOS” (sign of strength) into the next major horizontal ceiling around ~$3.40. From there, the schematic expects another pause and “LPS” beneath that ~$3.40 zone, before the final markup leg accelerates into the ~$8 region. In short, the chart’s bullish outcome is conditional on sequential level-flips: first $2.08, then the channel, then ~$3.40 and finally $8. Until now, XRP is “following perfectly” the path, as the analyst noted via X. At press time, XRP traded at $2.13. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",
