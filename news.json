    "body": "Binance Coin climbed again over the weekend, pushing past the $900 mark and touching about $907 on Sunday after a sharp 24-hour uptick. Markets were calmer overall, with the broader crypto complex up 0.55% for the day while Bitcoin hovered above $92,000 and Ethereum traded beyond $3,100. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator Market Reaction To Regulatory Shift According to social posts from Changpeng Zhao, founder and former CEO of Binance who is also known as ‘CZ’, optimism around a possible new crypto cycle helped fuel demand. CZ linked the mood to a regulatory change, saying the Securities and Exchange Commission had removed crypto from its list of priority risks for 2026. Based on reports, that move is being read by some investors as a sign of easing scrutiny, and it appears to have lifted sentiment across tokens. I could be wrong, but Super Cycle incoming. https://t.co/6TLldEMmGA — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) January 10, 2026 Institutional Buying Adds Fuel Reports note sizable institutional flows into Bitcoin products. According to a filing, Wells Fargo bought 383 million of Bitcoin ETF shares, a figure that market watchers flagged as a large institutional stake. Morgan Stanley also filed for its own spot Bitcoin ETF last week, which many see as more proof that big financial players are stepping in. Those actions are being cited by traders as one reason risk assets like Binance Coin could see more interest. Macroeconomic Calendar Could Swing Prices A packed US data week is ahead and traders say it could affect crypto angles. On Monday, the market will watch a speech by the FOMC president. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the US Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index are due. Jobless claims come on Thursday, and a Fed balance sheet update lands on Friday. Any big surprise in those numbers can push liquidity flows and quickly change appetite for tokens. Binance Coin: Technical Levels To Watch BNB briefly reclaimed the $900 zone and was reported at $909 in some feeds as the four-hour chart showed a steady climb. Short-term resistance sits near $950, with a psychological barrier at $1,000. Related Reading: XRP Ledger May Get A Tokenized Gold Upgrade, Web3 Founder Reveals Technical indicators offered cautious support for bulls: the MACD showed a bullish crossover with the blue line above the signal line, and the histogram printed positive bars, which suggests buying pressure building. The RSI sat around 56.10, under overbought levels, implying room for more gains. Traders still point to a key support range near $850. A break below that could invite heavier selling and take prices down toward $820. The scenario of a quick pullback is real; prices that move fast up can move fast down. Market participants will be watching both the macro calendar and any fresh regulatory updates for clues. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "Crypto trading platform MEXC has rolled out a new promotional campaign built around its peer-to-peer marketplace, offering a $200,000 airdrop pool exclusively for users making their first-ever deposit on the platform. The limited-time event began on Jan. 4, 2026, at 11:00 UTC and will run until Jan. 31 at 16:59 UTC. Participation is restricted to accounts that have never previously deposited funds on MEXC, with eligibility tied specifically to deposits completed through the exchange’s P2P channel rather than standard trading methods. To take part, users must first register for the campaign via the dedicated event page. Only after opting in are participants able to qualify by completing their first P2P deposit and reaching a net deposited amount exceeding $100 during the event period. MEXC notes that users who fail to register before depositing will not be counted toward the promotion. Participants who meet the requirements within seven days of registration unlock a fixed 10 USDT reward. All rewards are distributed from a shared $200,000 pool and allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, meaning that late participants may miss out once the pool is fully claimed. Following the conclusion of the campaign, eligible rewards will be credited directly to users’ Spot wallets. MEXC states that distribution will take place within 14 calendar days after the event ends, with most users expected to receive their airdrops within five business days. The campaign places renewed focus on MEXC’s P2P trading service, which allows users to purchase cryptocurrencies using local currencies, flexible pricing, and a wide range of payment methods. Unlike traditional exchange trades, P2P transactions on MEXC come with zero platform fees, a feature the exchange continues to promote as competition among P2P marketplaces intensifies. Through the P2P platform, users can access major cryptocurrencies including USDT, Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, Dogecoin, and Solana. The service is designed to cater to regions where direct fiat on-ramps may be limited or where users prefer localized payment options. However, the exchange has outlined several restrictions tied to the promotion. Users who withdraw funds within 24 hours of meeting the deposit requirements will be disqualified from receiving rewards. In addition, participants who have previously received rewards from other MEXC P2P promotions are excluded from this campaign. Eligibility is limited to main accounts only. Sub-accounts cannot participate independently, and any activity associated with them will be consolidated under the primary account for the purposes of eligibility checks and reward calculations. MEXC also applies internal risk and compliance reviews before rewards are finalized.

    "body": "Bitcoin pushed above the $92,000 level late-Sunday as a legal escalation around Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell became public. The catalyst was Powell’s decision to publicly address Department of Justice subpoenas and a criminal probe he characterized as political pressure tied to the administration’s rate preferences. In a video released Sunday evening, Powell directly addressed US President Donald Trump: “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Fed setting rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.” BREAKING: Fed Chair Powell responds after Federal prosecutors open a criminal investigation into him: “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Fed setting rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of… pic.twitter.com/y1dRdoQ1fm — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) January 12, 2026 Bitcoin Community Reacts To The News The Bitcoin and broader crypto market responded immediately with a decent push higher, while “metals [were] blasting to new highs,” as analyst Will Clemente wrote via X. Related Reading: CVDD Model Signals Bitcoin Is Not Yet Deeply Undervalued: Drawdown Lags Historical Cycles The timing matters for crypto traders: the Fed is heading into its January 28 meeting with the market increasingly primed for a pause in cuts, amplifying sensitivity to any perception that monetary policy is being pulled into partisan conflict. For Bitcoin-native observers, the episode read like a real-time stress test of institutional trust: one that flatters Bitcoin’s pitch. Clemente added via X: “This environment is literally what Bitcoin was created for. The President is coming after the Fed chair. Metals are ripping as sovereigns diversify reserves. Stocks & risk assets at record highs. Geopolitical risk rising.” Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy, put the contrast in monetary regimes front and center, arguing that Bitcoin’s “credibly neutral, predictable, transparent, and censorship resistant monetary policy looks pretty good here,” after flagging Powell’s view that the subpoenas are “pretexts” for administrative meddling in monetary policy. Related Reading: Cathie Wood: Trump May Buy Bitcoin For US Reserve Ahead Of Midterms Others used the moment to widen the indictment beyond any single personality. Bitwise advisor Jeff Park argued that “independence alone cannot be a virtue when the institution at its core is incompetent,” adding that “the age of Bitcoin is drawing nearer.” Walker, a prominent pro-Bitcoin voice, framed it as a structural problem: “The problem isn’t President Trump or Jerome Powell. The problem is a centralized cabal of unelected banker-bureaucrats set the price of money and print it out of thin air.” Notably, the bullish reflex wasn’t rooted in sympathy for Powell. Strive CEO Matt Cole wrote he had “zero sympathy” for the Fed chair and accused the central bank of “gaslight[ing] the American people” on independence, concluding: “Bitcoin is even more underpriced than we realized…” Bitcoin’s move through $92,000 puts that narrative onto a price chart, but the same political-legal feedback loop that fuels the “neutral money” thesis can also intensify volatility. “For the first time ever, Fed Chair Powell is fighting back: Over the last 12 months, Fed Chair Powell has remained silent amid President Trump’s criticisms,” The Kobeissi Letter wrote via X, adding: “Today, that changed. Trump vs Powell will result in even more volatility.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,560. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Win Your Share of US$250,000 in SOL, Enter the Airdrop Arena",
    "body": "Crypto.com has launched a fresh reward campaign inside Airdrop Arena, giving users a new way to earn without needing to trade daily. The event comes with a headline incentive, a US$250,000 SOL token reward pool that will be distributed to participants who allocate CRO during the campaign window. The promotion is already live and runs for the full month of January, combining Crypto.com’s CRO ecosystem with Solana, one of the most active layer-1 networks in crypto right now. Instead of pushing high-volume trading, this campaign is built around steady participation, where users accumulate points over time and receive SOL rewards after the event ends. A Straightforward CRO Allocation Reward System The structure behind the campaign is intentionally simple. Users allocate CRO into Airdrop Arena, earn points while the event is active, and then receive a portion of the SOL pool based on how many points they’ve collected. Crypto.com is also rewarding early activity. The first 10,000 users who allocate CRO unlock an exclusive points boost of up to 120%, giving them a clear advantage right from the start. On top of that, users can qualify for a daily points boost of up to 120% when they purchase at least 1,500 CRO and transfer it into Airdrop Arena. Tip: The purchase task needs to be completed before allocating CRO, otherwise the daily boost may not apply. How to Participate Through the Crypto.com App Everything happens inside the Crypto.com app, making the process quick even for casual users. Airdrop Arena can be accessed through the Account section, the Earn tab, or the Supermenu. Once inside the feature, users simply allocate CRO into the event and begin earning points automatically. There’s no need for constant monitoring, no complicated strategy, and no trading requirement, which makes this campaign feel more like passive participation than active speculation. Visit Crypto.com Allocate now and start building points. Campaign Dates and Key Event Details The event runs on a fixed schedule: Event duration: 1 January 2026, 10:00 UTC to 31 January 2026, 09:59 UTC Once the event ends, Crypto.com will calculate each participant’s points total and distribute SOL accordingly. Rewards, Distribution Timeline, and Lockup Rules SOL rewards will be airdropped within 7 days after the campaign concludes. Users who activate Loot Locker will receive their rewards after the lockup period ends. If Loot Locker is not enabled, SOL will be distributed directly to the user’s Crypto Wallet. The CRO allocation itself comes with a long-term condition: allocated CRO is locked for 6 months. After the lockup ends, users can withdraw their CRO or keep it allocated in Airdrop Arena to automatically join future campaigns, which is clearly designed to encourage longer-term engagement instead of short-term participation. Solana Rewards Add Extra Appeal Choosing SOL as the reward asset is not random. Solana remains one of the most watched ecosystems in crypto, supported by ongoing developer activity, memecoin momentum, DeFi growth, and infrastructure expansion. That makes SOL a reward that users actually want to hold, not just a token they instantly dump. By linking CRO allocation with SOL incentives, Crypto.com effectively ties its platform activity to another major chain that continues to attract attention from both retail and serious market participants. Airdrop Arena Reflects a Bigger Exchange Trend This campaign also fits a bigger shift happening across exchanges. Platforms are increasingly moving away from pure volume-driven rewards and instead focusing on loyalty mechanics: time-based campaigns, allocation systems, and engagement incentives that keep users active inside the ecosystem. For CRO holders, the SOL Airdrop Arena offers a way to gain exposure to Solana without selling assets or actively trading. For Crypto.com, it strengthens retention and pushes long-term platform participation through structured lockups and recurring event access. Visit Airdop Arena Allocate now and watch your points grow.",

    "title": "Solana Price Jumps, But Network Adoption Remains Weak",
    "body": "On-chain data shows the Network Growth indicator has continued to fall for Solana recently, a sign that adoption of the asset has remained weak. Solana Network Growth Has Been Declining According to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, SOL’s recent price recovery has come despite a drop in the Network Growth. This metric measures the weekly total number of addresses that are coming online on the blockchain for the first time. A wallet comes “online” on the network when it participates in some kind of transfer activity. Thus, the wallets that the Network Growth is counting are the ones that are making their first transaction on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Drop To $69,000 If Pennant Support Breaks, Analyst Warns When the value of the Network Growth is high, it means that a large number of addresses are being created on the blockchain. Such a trend can be a sign that an influx of users is occurring. On the other hand, the indicator being low suggests that there isn’t much new address generation taking place on the network, which can be a potential indication that the chain isn’t attracting fresh investors. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Solana Network Growth over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Solana Network Growth has witnessed a drawdown recently, despite the fact that the SOL price has made some recovery since its December low. This suggests that the bullish price action has been unable to bring fresh attention to the cryptocurrency. Historically, rallies have generally needed the incoming of new investors to be sustainable, as it’s the increased trading activity that provides them with the fuel to go on. In the chart, Santiment has highlighted the case of a rally where this requirement wasn’t met. The Network Growth was initially at a significant level, but as this price surge from 2025 played out, the metric’s value plummeted. This could be a potential factor behind the rally eventually running out of momentum. In late 2024, the opposite conditions were present, as the Network Growth shot up alongside the Solana bull run, implying adoption backed the price appreciation. Considering these past cases, it’s possible that the indicator might have to reverse its trajectory if SOL’s recovery has to last. The latest downward move in the Network Growth is also not the only development SOL is dealing with right now. From the graph, it’s visible that the indicator has gone through a long-term downtrend since its high in November 2024. Related Reading: $460M Crypto Longs Squeezed As Bitcoin Slips Below $90,000 Back then, the metric had a value of 30.2 million, but today, the figure has dropped to just 7.3 million. It now remains to be seen whether the long decline in the adoption of Solana will continue or if a turnaround will appear. SOL Price Solana recovered back to $144 on Sunday, but the coin has retraced to open the week as its price is back at $139. Featured image from Dall-E, Santiment.net, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Why XRP Deserves A Place As Long-Term Wealth And Life-Saving Strategy",
    "body": "In a world where financial systems are becoming fragile, XRP stands out as the intersection of a financial infrastructure designed for instant global value transfer, speed, reliability, and global accessibility. XRP’s ability to move value instantly across borders, with minimal cost and without reliance on fragile banking systems, positions it as both a long-term wealth tool and a potential life-saving instrument. XRP should be considered as part of life-saving plans. An analyst known as Bird on X has pointed out that most people keep their money in the bank, earning around 4-6% a year, and feel comfortable with it, but they rarely factor in the impact of inflation. Over time, the purchasing power of currencies like the US dollar and the British pound has been quietly eroded to the point where your money can grow on paper while losing value in the real world. XRP’s Role In The Next Phase Of Global Payments Although savings accounts are safe, many people are actually standing still or falling massively behind without even realizing it, which is why XRP comes in as a long-term life-saving strategy. XRP has spent years held back by legal uncertainty, and during that time, the technology continued to mature. Currently, there’s clarity, and what was being built has become visible. Related Reading: XRP Ledger May Get A Tokenized Gold Upgrade, Web3 Founder Reveals Real-world usage is arriving in cross-border payments, institutions are engaging, stablecoins like RLUSD are being introduced, and real-world assets are being tokenized on the chain. As the utility is increasing, capital is flowing into the ecosystem. More usage creates more demand, and sustained demand is what drives long-term value growth. According to Bird, XRP is to be trusted more than fiat, which is why it is a long-term savings vehicle rather than a short-term trade. XRP can be reserved for self-custody, stored on a cold wallet, removing reliance on banks altogether. Instead of earning a few percentages while fighting inflation, you’re holding a digital asset positioned at the centre of growing global financial infrastructure, which is more likely to increase in value over time. In comparison, it is unclear whether inflation will ever pause to make cash worth more. The analyst views this scenario as a long-term wealth investment and believes that XRP will become one of the most utilised digital assets in the world. Thus, building a savings position now could prove to be one of the smartest financial decisions someone could make over the long run. A Bridge Between Old Money And New Rails ChartNerd noted that Ripple is not built to be a traditional crypto company that aims to destroy the old money. Instead, Ripple acts as the bridge between the old and new financial worlds, and this will be a more successful long-term strategy.

    "title": "Dogecoin Breaks Its ‘Lower-Band Prison’ As Daily Trend Flips",
    "body": "The Dogecoin price is currently up by approximately 17% since the December 31 low and the rebound is starting to look less like a dead-cat bounce and more like a regime change, according to crypto analyst Cantonese Cat, who points to a clear shift in how DOGE is trading inside its Bollinger Bands on the daily chart. The setup matters now because price has moved from months of lower-band pressure into the upper half of the range, often the earliest tell that trend behavior is rotating. Cantonese Cat’s latest daily view (Binance) frames the move through Bollinger Band positioning rather than pattern-chasing. As the analyst put it: “DOGE daily shows a clear trend change that is easy to see when you see how it was riding on the lower half of the Bollinger band for months but now has a clear change in character.” That “character” is visible in the band mechanics. DOGE closed around $0.1405 on the print shown, now trading above the 20-day basis line near $0.1348 after spending much of the prior stretch leaning into the lower half of the envelope. The upper band is near $0.1564 and the lower band near $0.1132. Related Reading: Here’s How High The Dogecoin Price Would If It Repeats Previous Parabolic Runs In the analyst’s framing, the basis line becomes the near-term “line in the sand” for whether this is a genuine trend flip or simply a volatility expansion that fades. Holding above it keeps price in the upper half of the bands, where trends typically behave differently than they do during lower-band rides. Weekly And Monthly Chart Support The Thesis Zooming out, Cantonese Cat’s weekly chart (Dec. 20) casts the broader structure as an Elliott-style sequence: a completed Wave 1 advance followed by a Wave 2 correction. The analyst wrote: “We’ve already had a 13 month bear market for DOGE, with my working hypothesis of this being likely a wave 2 correction prior to wave 3 explosion. The entire reason why this may play out is that it doesn’t feel likely right now, and you want me to stop posting.” Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Rally A Dead Cat Bounce? Analysts Weigh In The levels on the chart are explicit. DOGE is sitting between the 0.382 retracement near $0.1177 and the 0.5 level near $0.1542, with higher retracement markers at roughly $0.2021 (0.618), $0.2477 (0.707), $0.2968 (0.786), and $0.3732 (0.886). Above that, the 1.0 level is labeled near $0.4844, with extensions reaching approximately $0.9029 (1.272), $1.2497 (1.414), $1.9934 (1.618), $4.7793 (2.0), and $8.9077 (2.272), the latter aligning with the analyst’s repeatedly cited “$9 region” target for this cycle. On Jan. 9, Cantonese Cat paired DOGE’s monthly chart with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), arguing a recurring bull-phase rhythm: “DOGE has always been about 2-4 months behind IWM during the bull phase.” The comparison highlights prior instances where IWM’s breakout behavior preceded DOGE’s major upside phases, implying DOGE’s current improvement could be read as a delayed echo if the template holds. Overall, the near-term question is whether DOGE can keep closing above the daily Bollinger basis (~$0.1348) and avoid slipping back into the lower-half posture that defined the prior months. On the upside, a break above the upper band region (~$0.1564) and the 0.5 Fib ($0.1542) is crucial for further upside. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.13674.

    "title": "This Ethereum Triangle Breakout Puts Price Above $24,000, Here’s The Path",
    "body": "Ethereum is nearing a decisive phase that could unlock a major long-term price expansion. A higher-timeframe analysis shared by a TradingView analyst suggests that, despite current short-term weakness, Ethereum remains structurally positioned for a significant upside move. If the ongoing formation resolves as expected, the projected breakout places Ethereum’s price well above $24,000. Ethereum’s Long-Term Structure Remains Intact From a broader perspective, the analyst emphasizes that Ethereum has not broken its established trend since 2020. Over that period, price action has continued to form higher highs, reinforcing the view that the long-term structure remains valid. Rather than signaling failure, the prolonged consolidation seen over recent years is framed as stabilization within a large and defined range. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Strongest XRP Price Rally In History Is Coming, Here’s Why This range sits between $1,000 and $3,000, with the $1,000 level identified as a critical psychological and structural support. According to the analysis, Ethereum’s ability to hold above this zone is central to the bullish thesis. Remaining above it allows the asset to continue developing a massive ascending triangle, a formation often associated with strong continuation moves once completed. Within this triangle, the analyst outlines a clear progression of internal price phases. Two major legs of the structure have already formed, and Ethereum is now moving through the final phase needed to complete the setup. This phase has brought short-term bearish signals, but they remain part of the broader structure rather than a structural breakdown. As the price approaches the lower boundary of the triangle, several layers of support converge. These include the rising structural trendline and key moving averages that have historically supported Ethereum’s price. The analyst notes that stabilization and a bounce are likely in this area, provided Ethereum does not break below the triangle’s lower limit. Such a break would invalidate the structure, but current conditions suggest that risk remains contained. Why A Breakout Opens The Door To $24,000 The bullish scenario hinges on confirmation. Once the triangle is fully formed and Ethereum breaks above its upper boundary, the analyst expects a continuation move to follow. Based on the size of the formation and prior market behavior, the projected expansion points to a move of roughly 300% from current levels. When applied to Ethereum’s existing range, that expansion places the primary bullish target above $24,000. This projection is not presented as a short-term price call, but as the potential outcome of a multi-year structure finally resolving upward. Related Reading: XRP Mirrors Gold’s Trajectory: What A Similar ATH Rally Would Mean Additional context strengthens this outlook. Ethereum continues to benefit from growing institutional participation, and recent data shows record stablecoin transfer volumes exceeding $8 trillion on the network. These developments suggest increasing reliance on Ethereum’s infrastructure, which could support sustained price expansion following a confirmed breakout. Ultimately, the analyst believes Ethereum’s next major move depends on how this consolidation phase concludes. If the structure holds and the breakout is confirmed, the path toward prices above $24,000 becomes a technical continuation rather than an outlier scenario.
