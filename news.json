    "title": "Bitcoin Bullish Structure Weakens As Inter-Exchange Liquidity Touches Red Zone – Details",
    "body": "The Bitcoin market is experiencing a gradual trend reversal following weeks of prolonged price correction between October and November. However, recent on-chain data reveals a concerning trend around BTC’s bullish structure. Related Reading: Here’s Why Bitcoin’s Reaction To Fed Policy Turns Bearish After Each FOMC Update Bitcoin IFP Indicator Suggests Market Has Reached Turning Point Popular analytics page Arab Chain has shared a cautionary insight on the Bitcoin market despite the moderate price recovery in recent weeks. After Bitcoin suffered a 36.5% correction from its all-time high at $126,000, the market leader has lately experienced a significant rebound, rising from $80,000 to as high as $94,000 in the past three weeks. However, data from the Bitcoin Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP) suggests the upward price momentum might be short-lived. For perspective, the Bitcoin IFP measures the net movement of Bitcoin between exchanges over a given period. Arab Chain explains the IFP indicator continues to trend downward, after breaking below its 90-day moving average (MA), suggesting a weakening market participation amid fewer “bullish” flows between exchanges. Furthermore, the IFP also sits in the red zone, which historically coincides with or precedes a correction period or weak structural momentum that could precede a broader downtrend. Combined, these developments imply the Bitcoin market is at a critical junction, as there is a reduction in exchange flows that has historically supported the price rallies in past market phases. Related Reading: Fed Cut Lights The Fuse: Bitcoin Rebounds And Bulls Predict More Upside Is The Bullish Run Over? Amidst the structural weakness highlighted by the IFP indicator, Arab Chain also noted that the price remains relatively high compared to previous levels in similar situations. The analysts explain that this suggests price and inflows are temporarily moving irrespective of each other. Based on historical data, such detachments usually indicate a prolonged price consolidation or a significant period of extended sideways movement until inter-exchange flows can reestablish market dominance. Therefore, the Bitcoin bullish structure is not collapsing into a bearish state. However, the IFP metric developments suggest there may not be sustained upward movement in the short term due to the structural slowdown in inter-exchange flows. Moreover, price is likely to become sensitive to changes in the market liquidity. Therefore, there is also significant potential for another correction. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $90,338, reflecting a 1.82% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, daily trading volume is up by 34.64% and valued at $82.68 billion. According to Arab Chain, a continuous price rebound will only occur if the IFP successfully reclaims its 90-day MA, thereby signaling an increase in bullish exchange flows.

    "title": "If This Ethereum Bear Flag Pattern Holds, ETH Price Could Be On Its Way To $2,400",
    "body": "Since early October, when the Ethereum price began its dive into bearish territory, it has struggled to regain any of its significant price levels. The Ether token failed to hold at multiple support zones throughout November, as it plunged downwards. While Ethereum appears to be gaining bullish momentum to signal an imminent price reversal, a bearish continuation looks like the more probable scenario after the latest decline to $3,000. A popular analyst has recently put forward a prognosis, which paints a worrying picture for the second-largest cryptocurrency. $2,400 Might Be The Next Price Cushion For ETH In a December 13 post on the social media platform X, market analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that the Ethereum price is showing an interesting sign of a potential bearish continuation over the coming weeks. Martinez’s analysis hinged on the bear flag pattern, a technical analysis pattern that is often used to confirm the continuation of a downtrend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Tightens Up: Symmetrical Triangle Converges With High-Timeframe Wyckoff Setup Typically, the pattern has two components — the flag and the flag pole. Price initially displays a sharp downward move, forming the flagpole. Afterwards, there is usually a brief period where the price displays upward movement or even sideways consolidation; this period of choppy price action makes up ‘the flag.’ What gives the flag its integrity is its upper and lower boundaries, which serve as resistance and support zones. Because breakouts beneath support zones typically indicate that the market could be bearish, a failure of the flag’s support would then be the needed confirmation of the earlier-seen sell signal. In the scenario where this happens, the crypto pundit pointed out that Ethereum’s possible target could be the $2,400 price level. This is likely the case because all preceding regions may present with insufficient liquidity to sponsor any significant price reversal. Ethereum Whales’ Realized Price Of $2,400 Comes In Sight — What To Expect Interestingly, on-chain data adds credence to $2,400’s reputation as a relevant price level. In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, a pseudonymous pundit, OnChain, revealed that Ethereum is currently happens to be trading very close to a significant price level. According to the analyst, Ethereum whales — with holdings of at least 100,000 ETH — mostly procured their coins close to $2,400. Interestingly, the Ether token barely ever falls to price levels close to the realized price of this group of investors. Since the last five years, there have only been four instances where the ETH price nearly reached the acquisition price of these whales, before eventually seeing major recoveries. If this historical pattern thus plays out, the second-largest cryptocurrency might have seen the beginning of yet another bullish rally. As of this writing, Ethereum holds a valuation of $3,086, reflecting a 4% price decline in the past day.

    "title": "Dogecoin Triangle Support Test Maps Out Recovery Roadmap And When To Sell",
    "body": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is testing the lower boundary of a long-term triangle pattern, a move that could determine its next major price direction. A new technical analysis highlights a roadmap with key recovery levels and outlines a potential timeframe when selling and profit-taking may become favorable. Dogecoin Triangle Pattern Signals Recovery Path In a recent X post, crypto analyst Jonathan Carter presented a new analysis of Dogecoin’s price action, predicting that a potential recovery may be imminent. Carter explained that Dogecoin is currently testing a critical support area around $0.135 within a long-standing descending triangle chart structure. The setup is unfolding over the 3-day timeframe, with price action remaining above the pattern’s lower boundary. This zone has become a key battlefield between buyers and sellers. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher Carter highlights that the ongoing support area offers a favorable risk-reward profile for market participants. Buyers stepping in at this level are attempting to prevent a breakdown that could invalidate the broader recovery outlook. This means holding above this support zone could keep Dogecoin’s bullish scenario intact. The descending triangle visible on the analyst’s shared chart shows a series of lower highs pressing against the stable support zone at $0.135. This compression often precedes a decisive move once the price reacts strongly at the base. Dogecoin’s current structure also suggests the market is steadily approaching that inflection point. The volume data at the bottom of the chart has yet to show strong expansion near the support area. This indicates that Dogecoin’s trading activity has been relatively muted, suggesting that the market may be waiting for confirmation before committing to a significant upward move. If Dogecoin successfully rebounds from the $0.135 support zone, Carter’s chart maps out several upside levels to watch. Initial recovery targets are seen around $0.155 and $0.190, where previous price reactions occurred. Clearing these levels would signal growing momentum and a possible end to DOGE’s downtrend. Further upside extensions projected on the chart include $0.250 and $0.310, which align with previous consolidation areas. A stronger continuation could open the path toward $0.370 and ultimately the resistance zone near $0.470. Resistance Zone Reveals When To Sell DOGE Carter’s Dogecoin chart clearly shows the $0.47 resistance zone, where sellers are expected to become active again. A rally into the zone would likely face increased selling pressure based on historical price behaviour. As a result, the resistance area serves as a strategic level for profit-taking rather than for new entries in Dogecoin. Related Reading: Binance’s USD1 Stablecoin Push Deepens Relationship With Trump’s Crypto Platform Overall, Carter’s analysis suggests that Dogecoin’s price is sitting at a pivotal technical level that could shape its next major move. The meme coin’s price is currently down, having crashed by over 22% year-to-date, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite this slip, Carter remains optimistic about DOGE’s recovery path. The recovery timeline highlighted in the analysis suggests that by 2026, the meme coin may have emerged from its downturn. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Macro Retracement Meets Mid-Range Battle – Will Bulls Reclaim Momentum?",
    "body": "Bitcoin is facing a critical juncture as its macro retracement converges with a tight mid-range battle between $86,000 and $100,000. With bearish patterns confirmed and short-term support holding, the market now waits to see if bulls can reclaim momentum or if a deeper pullback is on the horizon. Bitcoin Confirms Macro Top: Bearish Phase Underway According to an update from Crypto Patel, Bitcoin appears to have confirmed a market top and is now transitioning into a broader macro retracement phase. The loss of a key bullish support level has shifted the market structure into a bearish phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Market Structure Strengthens Despite Slower Trading Activity — Here’s Why The chart shows that a Head and Shoulders formation has fully played out. Classical technical rules suggest that the 162% downside projection has already been achieved, reinforcing the view that a cycle top is in place and a larger trend reversal is underway. Looking at the macro Fibonacci retracement from the bear-market low to the recent peak, several key levels come into focus. These include the 0.382 retracement, which sits near $56,700, and the 0.5 level around $44,000, representing a zone of potential bear-market acceptance. Additionally, the 0.618 retracement near $35,000 stands out as the strongest long-term support area. On the liquidity side, an unfilled fair value gap between $98,000 and $100,000 acts as a magnet for a short-term relief bounce before the broader downtrend resumes. Overall, the macro outlook for Bitcoin remains bearish. While a bounce toward the $98,000–$100,000 region is possible, the dominant path points toward a deeper move into the $70,000–$60,000 Fibonacci supports. Traders are advised to wait for confirmation and remain flexible, respecting multiple scenarios as the market unfolds. BTC Trapped: $96,000–$100,000 Cap Meets $86,000 Support Bitcoin remains range-bound between two critical zones as noted by CyrilXBT. Price is hovering near the $90,300 area after facing another rejection from the $96,000–$100,000 supply zone and the 50-day EMA. This region has consistently capped upside attempts over the past several weeks.

From a broader market perspective, Bitcoin previously cooled off while tech stocks surged. As momentum in tech begins to slow, BTC is attempting to stabilize, but a decisive reclaim of the $96,000–$100,000 zone is still required to shift momentum. A sustained move above $100,000 would open the door to trend reversal. Conversely, a loss of the $88,000 support could expose Bitcoin to a deeper pullback toward the $72,000–$76,000 region. Until either scenario plays out, price action remains choppy, and patience is warranted. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "XRP Mirrors 2016 Trend That Led To 69% Crash Before 110,000% Rally",
    "body": "XRP has struggled to create any upside traction over the past few days, with the price rejecting above $2.15 in the middle of the week and now back to lingering just above the $2 level. A new long-term technical comparison shared by crypto analyst ChartNerd places XRP’s price behavior since its July all-time high of $3.65 into an interesting context, implying that what XRP is doing now resembles a phase from its 2016 market cycle that points to an incoming huge rally. Related Reading: American Bitcoin Makes Big Buy, Adds 416 BTC To Its Stack Repeating 2016 Rejection And ABC Crash Structure According to crypto analyst ChartNerd, XRP’s current structure matches a similar price action that unfolded in late 2016. when price rejected an accumulation supply block and rolled into an ABC corrective move. That correction ultimately produced a 69% flash-wick decline that extended into the first quarter of 2017. The drop was severe and unfolded over several months, eventually pushing XRP to as low as $0.00240, but it eventually represented the end of the correction rather than the end of the bullish cycle. The chart accompanying the analysis, which is shown below, highlights a similar rejection pattern forming now. This pattern is based on how the XRP price rejected at its most recent all-time high in July. Since then, the monthly price chart has been printing consecutive red candles, with monthly closes consistently below opens. At the time of writing, XRP is about a 44% correction from this all-time high. This means a 69% correction is yet to play out in its entirety. Therefore, if history repeats, a full 69% ABC-style move from the all-time high would drag XRP back below $1 and as low as $0.8. This move is expected to play out into the first quarter of 2026. XRP Price Chart. Source: @ChartNerdTA Potential Drop Could Be A Set-Up For A Much Larger Rally XRP is currently trading at $2.04. Therefore, a deeper pullback below $1 will translate to a 51% decrease from the current price action. The idea of a deeper pullback from $2 is tough to imagine, especially given the inflows into Spot XRP ETFs. In fact, a pullback of that magnitude could test conviction across the market and cause many bullish traders to step aside. However, the technical analysis frames it as a structural reset rather than anything else. In 2017, the post-crash consolidation laid the groundwork for one of XRP’s most explosive rallies on record, ultimately delivering gains in excess of 110,000%. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher If this sequence plays out as expected, then the real bullish opportunity would develop later in 2026. From that reset zone, the chart projects a long-term advance to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, placing a potential upside target around $27. The visual projection in the chart above shows a clean multi-month expansion zone that delivers a 2,300% gain after the corrective phase. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Ethereum Holds Support As Smart Money Steps In – What This Means For Price",
    "body": "Ethereum is holding firm above key support as smart money steps in, hinting at growing confidence beneath the surface. With bullish signals and steady inflows aligning, the market now watches whether this stability can spark a meaningful upside move. ETH Coils Below $3,200 Ahead Of A Decisive Move AltCoin Việt Nam, in a recent post, highlighted that ETH is positioned at an extremely tense moment on its chart, signaling that the asset is preparing for a major directional move. This immediate pressure is being fueled by a significant bullish divergence that has just appeared on the chart, marking the first time the signal has materialized in over a month. Related Reading: Why Ethereum’s Rally Isn’t Overheated – And Where Demand Must Grow Next The analyst reinforced the expectation of high volatility by referencing historical data. Their research shows a consistent history of 9–16% price volatility whenever ETH falls below the $3,200 level. Given that the price is currently fluctuating tightly around the $3,100 mark, this historical context provides a clear signal that a sharp volatility explosion may be imminent. Adding overwhelming conviction to the bullish case is the recent action of market movers. AltCoin Việt Nam reported that a single super large whale just opened a leveraged long position totaling a massive $392 million (equivalent to 120,094 ETH). This colossal bet on the upside demonstrates a firm, high-conviction among institutional players. Furthermore, the institutional framework continues to provide a reliable underlying demand. The Spot Ethereum ETF market is still actively attracting substantial capital inflows, totaling over $250 million this week. BitMine Technologies also purchased an additional 33,504 ETH (valued at $112 million) today, highlighting persistent institutional accumulation. Considering the confluence of technical divergence, historical volatility context, and massive whale and institutional purchasing, the market faces a critical juncture. AltCoin Việt Nam posed the final question: Can ETH break out strongly and immediately confirm the uptrend, or will it need to retest lower support levels before initiating the expected explosive rally? Buyers Step In As Ethereum Defends Key Support According to crypto analyst The Boss, ETH has shown a highly encouraging response from a key technical area. Ethereum has reacted positively with the $3,091 support zone, and is currently holding firmly above this level, which is a strong signal that short-term buying pressure remains resilient and active in the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Inches Toward A Critical Decision Point: Bullish Break Or Deeper Dive? As long as the price stays above the green line, the analyst confirms that the primary focus remains the upside, validating the potential for a move toward the resistance zone marked by the blue line. The Boss emphasized the importance of these structural defense moves, concluding that such strong reactions from established support levels are vital signals for confirming the validity of the current structure and providing clear direction of the prevailing trend.

    "title": "Ethereum Active Address Count Hits Seven-Month Low  — What This Means",
    "body": "While the Ethereum price still struggles to mount a sustained bullish momentum, an investigation into its on-chain activity has revealed a significant change in the behavior of its market participants. Active Addresses Decline To 327,000 From 483,000 August High In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, market analyst CryptoOnchain shared that there has been a growing scarcity of activity within the Ethereum network. Specifically, the quant referenced data obtained from the Ethereum Active Addresses metric, observed on the 7-day Simple Moving Average. Related Reading: If This Ethereum Bear Flag Pattern Holds, ETH Price Could Be On Its Way To $2,400 Since reaching its peak in August, the Active Addresses metric has declined steadily from about 483,000 to 327,000 — a level which marks the lowest reached since May this year. This downturn of more than 32% suggests an increasing exit of willing participants from the Ethereum network. Interestingly, the aforementioned downturn is not a stand-alone phenomenon. Just around the same period where active addresses explored the southside of the charts, the Ethereum price also took on a bearish direction. This period saw the Ether token lose its $4,800 valuation and begin its descent to the current price around $3,100. According to the analyst, this strong correlation between the falling Ethereum valuation and its contracting network usage points to something clear — that the recent price drop is likely a result of reduced network demand. This further shows that market participants are moving past speculation, and are in lieu adopting a broader outlook on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum Market Outlook On the more positive side, CryptoOnchain explained how healthy bull cycles differ from the present market cycle. Typically, rising prices are not taken for granted as they often indicate a healthy bullish cycle. An expansion of the cryptocurrency’s network usage also lends credence — enough to serve as confirmation — to suspicions of structural shifts into bullish phases. This theory holds true from a variety of historical occurrences. So, a market would not qualify as bullish enough if the Ethereum price were on the rise without any parallel growth in on-chain activity. Hence, for a convincing price reversal to hold, there has to be a significant and sustained recovery of active addresses. This would signal the return of on-chain demand and further heighten expectations of imminent momentum. Until those conditions are simultaneously met, the Ethereum market remains in a state of utmost caution, where prices could head towards either direction, with the major factor being the influx of network users. As of press time, the Ether token is valued at about $3,106, reflecting no significant movement since the past day.

    "title": "Bitcoin Investors Brace For BOJ Rate Hike As Market Sell-Off Continues — Details",
    "body": "The Bitcoin market has continued to consolidate within the $90,000 price zone over the last day, reflecting a minor 0.04% gain within this period. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has witnessed a steady rally in recent weeks, forming the early phases of an ascending channel. To protect this potential uptrend, recent on-chain data shows that investors are moving to initiate a downside and price in the market effect of an anticipated negative catalyst.

Bitcoin Sees High Inflows, Negative Funding Rates As Investors Guard Against Rate Hike In a QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, the crypto analysis page XWIN Research Japan discusses how potential Japan economic developments are presently impacting the Bitcoin market. Notably, analysts and economists expect the Bank of Japan to announce a 25 bps rate hike at its next policy meeting between December 18-19, as the Asian nation moves to end an ultra-loose monetary regime. Interest rate hikes are generally interpreted as bearish catalysts as they force investors to move out of risky assets due to less available capital, thereby inducing a price decline. According to XWIN Research Japan, Bitcoin investors may currently be attempting to absorb the resulting price pressure, potentially muting the immediate impact of the primary catalyst itself. This theory is based on multiple developments, such as exchange netflows. The analysts at XWIN report that exchange inflows are rising to mirror similar levels seen during previous BOJ hikes. Investors are presently exiting exchanges and minimizing their spot exposure to reduce the market impact of the expected decision. Meanwhile, the funding rates are also declining, another event seen during past rate hikes. Notably, investors are proactively losing their leverage in what is a pre-event caution movement.

At press time, Bitcoin tie valued at $90,190, reflecting a market gain of 0.77% in the past week. With the Bank of Japan’s hawkish pivot largely priced in, XWIN Research says that market focus has shifted away from the rate hike itself toward post-announcement yen dynamics. Going forward, the analysts explain that Bitcoin’s near-term direction may hinge on whether the yen continues to strengthen or if markets respond with a “sell the rumor, buy the fact” reversal, signaling that the adjustment phase is already unfolding. With a market cap of $1.67 trillion, Bitcoin continues to rank as the largest cryptocurrency with a current market dominance of 58.2% Featured image from Flickr, chart from Tradingview",

    "title": "Bitcoin And Ethereum Market Structure Points To Crypto Winter – Details",
    "body": "The crypto market has shown a modest price rebound in the last three weeks, returning to a total market cap of $3.07 trillion. During this time, Bitcoin has climbed by 11% from its local bottom at $80,700, while Ethereum has been more aggressive, gaining by 18% within the same period. Despite these reassuring performances, a market analyst with the username PelinayPA postulates that the bear market has commenced, considering certain technical parameters. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Structure Weakens As Inter-Exchange Liquidity Touches Red Zone – Details BTC & ETH Moving Averages, Trading Volumes Signal Bear Season Bear market speculations have been at a heightened level in Q4 2025, as the crypto market suffered extensive price corrections, during which Bitcoin alone retraced by around 36.5%. While the market may have shown some steady upward mobility in recent weeks, many analysts remain convinced the bears have assumed market control, leaving little bullish potential for a full market reversal. In analyzing Bitcoin’s chart, PelinayPA explains that price is presently trading below the short (7, 14), medium (30, 50), and long-term moving averages (100), indicating a strong sellers’ dominance in the market. However, the more concerning observation is that these averages are sloping downward, suggesting the recent downtrend or corrections may not be temporary. Furthermore, the seasoned crypto analyst notes these moving averages are acting as resistance in classic bear-market behavior that initiates a selling spree upon contact with price. In addition, sellers are also aggressive as red candles come with higher volume, while hesitant buyers load the green candles with relatively lower volumes. Based on these technical observations, PelinayPA explains that Bitcoin is not launching a bullish market reversal, but rather remains in a reaction within a larger bear market. Meanwhile, the Ethereum market analysis shows a similar situation in that price is trading below key moving averages. However, the short-term MAs (7, 14) are beginning to turn upward. In addition, the price rebounds from lows are stable and stronger while candles are recording shorter wicks, indicating the selling pressure is less aggressive, why buying interest remains visible. Therefore, while Ethereum is clearly stronger than Bitcoin, the bullish strength remains insufficient to initiate a trend reversal as long-term MAs remain downward sloping amid low buying volume.

Meanwhile, daily trading volume is down by 20.34% and valued at $64.22 billion. According to PelinayPA, the Bitcoin bull rally is finished, and a deeper price correction is needed before investors see another parabolic surge or all-time high. The analyst predicts Bitcoin to bottom around $50,000 in the “ongoing” bear market, postulating a potential 44.4% decline from the present market prices.
