    "title": "Why This Friday Could Be Very Big For The Bitcoin Price",
    "body": "The Bitcoin price could experience major swings this Friday as billions of dollars in options are set to expire. A crypto market expert has warned that the scale of this event could trigger “something big,” potentially affecting both volatility and the actions of retail and institutional investors. Bitcoin Price Braces For Major Moves This Friday On Monday, crypto analyst NoLimit signaled that this upcoming Friday could be a historic moment for Bitcoin. According to the expert, over $23.6 billion worth of Bitcoin options are scheduled to expire on December 26, marking the largest options expiry the market has ever seen. The analyst has stated that anyone with crypto holdings should pay close attention. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Bull And Bear Cases That Crypto Traders Should Know About NoLimit explained that an options expiry involves leveraged bets on Bitcoin’s price. He stated that calls are wagers that the price will rise, while puts predict it will fall. The analyst also emphasized that when these options expire, they either become worthless or force buying and selling in the spot market to hedge the positions. He also highlighted that with $23.6 billion in options expiring in a single day, a massive amount of risk will be removed from dealer books all at once. According to the analysis, this risk offloading is a key driver of market volatility, as the magnitude of the expiry is unprecedented. Looking at the data, previous year-end expiries were significantly smaller. In 2021, the options expiry was around $6 billion, followed by $2.4 billion in 2022. It climbed to $11 billion in 2023 and reached $19.8 billion in 2024. NoLimit has suggested that this year’s jump to $23.6 billion represents a significant shift in market dynamics. The analyst pointed out that retail investors no longer dominate the market. He stated that institutional-sized risk is now being repriced in real time, and this Friday could trigger significant price movements. NoLimit also suggested that the scale and timing of the expiry make it a critical event for traders and investors in the market. Analyst Reveals Why This Friday Truly Matters In his analysis, NoLimit outlined the specific reasons why this Friday truly matters as Bitcoin’s $23.6 billion options prepare to expire. He explained that dealers are heavily hedged around key strikes, and once expiry hits, those hedges are removed. As a result, the shift can trigger sharp moves for Bitcoin in either direction. Related Reading: Don’t Expect A Fast Bitcoin Move – Here’s How Long The Last Leg Could Take The analyst noted that current market conditions could further amplify the impact. According to his analysis, Bitcoin’s liquidity is extremely low during the holiday week, and less volume typically means each order has more influence. As a result, the expert stated that a violent price move could occur even without major news. NoLimit also noted that much of Bitcoin’s Open Interest is concentrated near the major psychological levels. Once the expiry passes, this open interest disappears entirely. He explained that this is why markets often experience sideways trading leading into expiry, followed by a clear directional move shortly afterward. The analyst added that volatility is the key setup this week. He says the crucial moment to watch is the Bitcoin price after the expiry, not before.

    "body": "Solana (SOL) has entered the final stretch of 2025 under sustained pressure, caught between a weakening price structure and signs of steady institutional interest. Related Reading: Dogecoin: Why This One Price Level Is Drawing All the Attention Following a sharp 39% decline in the fourth quarter, SOL is struggling to regain momentum, trading in the low-$120 range as traders focus on whether key support levels can be sustained. The contrast between falling network activity and continued inflows into investment products has left the market divided on what comes next. While ETF-linked demand suggests confidence in Solana’s longer-term relevance, near-term price action remains fragile. With liquidity thinning toward year-end and broader crypto sentiment still cautious, SOL’s ability to defend lower support zones may shape how the market opens 2026. SOL's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Solana Network Slowdown and Bearish Technical Signals One of the main pressures on SOL has been a sharp drop in on-chain activity. The number of active users on the network decreased from approximately 30 million in late 2024 to under one million in Q4 2025, resulting in a decline in fee revenue and weakening demand for the token. This slowdown has coincided with a broader market pullback, as the total crypto market capitalization slipped toward $2.9 trillion and investors withdrew nearly $1 billion from digital asset investment products in a single week. Technically, momentum indicators remain tilted to the downside. SOL has posted a negative MACD reading and an RSI below neutral levels, while repeated failures to reclaim the $126–$130 zone have triggered long liquidations. Analysts warn that a loss of the $120 area could expose SOL to a deeper move toward $110, a level increasingly cited as a critical downside marker. ETF Inflows Highlight Institutional Divergence Despite weak price action, Solana-linked exchange-traded products have continued to attract capital. Recent data show more than $69 million in net inflows, setting SOL apart from Bitcoin and Ethereum products, which have seen net outflows. This divergence suggests some institutional investors are accumulating at lower prices, even as short-term traders remain defensive. Market watchers note that this gap between fund flows and spot price reflects differing time horizons. Institutions appear to be focused on Solana’s role as infrastructure for payments, tokenization, and high-throughput applications, while the spot market remains constrained by technical resistance and declining retail activity. Cross-chain Developments and Key SOL Levels Ahead Adding to the narrative, recent comments from Charles Hoskinson and Anatoly Yakovenko have reignited discussion around interoperability, with both founders signaling openness to a future cross-chain bridge between Solana and Cardano. While still early and informal, such developments spotlight ongoing efforts to expand liquidity and utility across ecosystems. Traders currently remain focused on price levels rather than long-term vision. Holding above $120 could stabilize sentiment, but a clear break below it would likely shift attention firmly to the $110 support zone.

    "title": "XRP Breaks $1.95 Support After 13 Months, Analyst Sees $0.90 Target",
    "body": "XRP has slipped below a level that, for much of the past year, acted like a structural anchor for the chart: the $1.95 area. Crypto analyst Guy on the Earth (@guyontheearth) argued that XRP has now closed under that zone on a higher timeframe, calling out the two-week chart specifically. “For the first time in 13 months XRP has closed under this monthly support at $1.95 on the 2 week chart,” he wrote. “It’s the second time on the weekly this has happened with April tariffs being the first.” The 2-Weekly Close Is Crucial For XRP From there, his analysis went straight to the downside implication. “The technical target of this break down is 90c,” he added. “Do with this information what you have to. Everyone must make their own decisions at this time. The goal is getting back above $1.95.” The way he laid it out, $1.95 was not simply a mid-range price level but the lower boundary of a broader consolidation “rectangle.” Losing it, in that framework, opens the door to a measured move lower — with the reclaim of $1.95 as the key invalidation. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecasts For 2026 Unveiled By AI Simulation: Should Investors Remain Bullish? He also offered a risk-management approach for holders who are uncomfortable sitting through a potential continuation move. “If you are uncomfortable holding your bags with this breakdown – sell to reduce risk to where you feel comfortable,” he wrote. “Buy back on a close above $1.95 on the daily ( or a timeframe that you believe in) and your % loss of XRP is next to nothing. But should we go to 90c you are looking at a further 50% loss in capital.” For those treating the move as an opportunity rather than a warning sign, he mapped out incremental levels he views as potential buy zones on the way down. “Alternatively if you believe in XRP longer term and don’t like trading at all – keep buying on the way down,” he wrote. “Key levels are at $1.61, $1.42 and finally the 90c target and the 75c initial breakout.” Even in a bearish framing, he cautioned against assuming a straight-line cascade into every marked level. “We have went in a straight line down for weeks so it is unlikely that these targets would all be hit imminently,” he said. “$1.42 lowest this week if things get really ugly – not massively likely but possible with this breakdown and a big sell off in BTC to lower lows.” Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Keeps Crashing Not everyone agreed with the choice of timeframe used to call the breakdown. One account, XRP whale (@cryptoXRPwhale), pushed back on the premise: “2 week chart is not significant. You can’t choose a specific timeframe and say it’s a structure breakdown that fits your narrative… lol” Guy responded by reiterating that the level being referenced is higher-timeframe support, not a short-term marker. “Look at the chart. It held 13 months and now broke structure,” he wrote. “The lower boundary is monthly support. I’ve said all this.” There was also an attempt in the replies to flip the bearish target into a bullish setup. “Any price under $1 will be short-lived & sets $XRP up for a stronger push to the upside past ATH,” wrote Lawrence Bensen (@Lawrence_Bensen), referencing prior cycle lows and a reported wick below $1 on Binance earlier in the cycle. Guy acknowledged the point while keeping the technical math intact. “Yeah for sure – it has already been to 90c on Binance [on October 10],” he wrote. “I think we will recover before going as low as 90c – but that is the technical target of losing this consolidation.” His near-term bias, meanwhile, leaned toward caution largely on liquidity conditions rather than an absolute conviction that $0.90 must print. “My bias is that I find it hard to believe at Christmas people are going to throw heaps of money in this market,” he wrote. “Low liquidity has been an issue anyways and this week wont help. So the slow bleed continues.” At press time, XRP stood at $1.89. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Gold & Silver Break Out While Bitcoin Chops: Why Capital Is Flowing Into Precious Metals",
    "body": "Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim the $90,000 level, and market confidence continues to deteriorate as an increasing number of analysts begin to call for a prolonged bear market. Sentiment has turned decisively cautious, with investors reassessing risk exposure and preparing for a potentially challenging period ahead. Despite multiple attempts to stabilize, price action remains compressed, offering little confirmation that bullish momentum is ready to return. Related Reading: The Gold-to-Bitcoin Rotation Narrative Gains Strength: A Data-Driven Review According to an analysis by XWIN Research Japan, the current market phase is best described as a range-bound consolidation following a high-level correction, with momentum conditionally tilted to the downside. While Bitcoin has remained largely sideways over the past three months, traditional safe-haven assets have followed a very different trajectory. Gold and silver have continued to push higher, reflecting rising demand for defensive assets amid persistent geopolitical tensions, policy uncertainty, and expectations of lower real interest rates. This divergence highlights a structural challenge for Bitcoin in the current macro environment. Institutional capital can allocate to precious metals with relative ease, benefiting from deep liquidity, established market infrastructure, and clear regulatory frameworks. Silver, in particular, has amplified gold’s move, supported by tighter supply dynamics and greater sensitivity to speculative flows. Bitcoin’s Role as a Risk Asset Limits Its Upside The analysis explains that Bitcoin has not followed gold and silver higher because it is still treated primarily as a high-beta risk asset, rather than a pure safe haven. In risk-off environments, capital typically flows first into gold and government bonds, where investors seek stability and capital preservation. Bitcoin, by contrast, is often a secondary consideration, attracting flows only after confidence improves. Unlike gold’s long-term and relatively price-insensitive buyer base, Bitcoin remains more exposed to short-term positioning and marginal demand, making broad macro tailwinds insufficient on their own to sustain a durable uptrend. CryptoQuant data reinforces this interpretation. Bitcoin’s apparent demand has recently turned negative, signaling that fresh demand is not expanding even as prices hold at relatively elevated levels. At the same time, Short-Term Holder SOPR has spent extended periods below 1, indicating that short-term participants are selling at a loss or near breakeven. This behavior typically adds selling pressure on rebounds, as underwater holders use price strength to exit positions. As long as capital continues to favor gold and silver, Bitcoin’s internal demand structure remains a key constraint. The base case points to continued support for precious metals, while Bitcoin’s upside stays capped by weak demand and short-term holder pressure. That view would only change if apparent demand turns sustainably positive and STH SOPR reclaims and holds above 1.

The chart shows that price has lost the short-term bullish structure, with BTC now firmly below the 50-day moving average (blue), which has started to slope downward. This confirms that short-term momentum has turned negative and rallies are facing increasing overhead supply. More importantly, price is now testing the 100-day moving average (green), which sits just above the current level and has acted as dynamic support throughout much of this cycle. The market’s reaction around this zone is critical. A sustained hold above the 100-day MA could allow Bitcoin to stabilize and form a base, while a decisive breakdown would likely expose the 200-day moving average (red), currently rising near the low $80,000s. Related Reading: Ethereum Market Structure Strengthens: Binance Netflows Point to Long-Term Conviction Volume dynamics reinforce the cautious outlook. The sell-off from the October peak was accompanied by elevated volume, signaling distribution rather than a shallow pullback. Since then, volume has tapered off, suggesting a lack of aggressive dip-buying interest at current levels. Structurally, Bitcoin remains in a broader uptrend as long as it holds above the 200-day MA, but the loss of the 50-day and weakening momentum indicate consolidation or further downside risk in the near term. Bulls need a recovery back above $90,000 to regain control and shift sentiment meaningfully. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Inflows Collapse While Binance Retains Relative Activity – Details",
    "body": "Bitcoin is on track to close the year in negative territory, a development that has reinforced growing concerns among analysts who are increasingly positioning for a potential bear market ahead. After failing to sustain momentum above key psychological and technical levels, market sentiment has shifted toward caution, with investors closely monitoring liquidity behavior and exchange flows for early signals of regime change. Related Reading: The Gold-to-Bitcoin Rotation Narrative Gains Strength: A Data-Driven Review Recent analysis from Arab Chain, based on CryptoQuant’s Exchange Inflow Value (7-day cumulative) metric, highlights a notable divergence in liquidity patterns between major exchanges. The data aggregates Bitcoin and Ethereum inflows, providing a broader view of risk positioning across the two largest crypto assets. On November 24, when Bitcoin was trading around $88,438, Coinbase recorded seven-day cumulative inflows totaling approximately $21.0 billion. In contrast, Binance saw lower, though still significant, inflows near $15.3 billion. What stands out is that these elevated inflows occurred while prices were already well below prior highs. Rather than signaling aggressive accumulation, the data points to increased exchange activity consistent with portfolio rebalancing, hedging, or preparation for potential distribution. Exchange Inflows Signal Liquidity Tightening Despite Stable Bitcoin Prices By December 21, Bitcoin was trading near $88,635. Only marginally higher than late-November levels and still locked within a narrow consolidation range. While price action showed little progress, exchange flow data pointed to a notable shift in market conditions. Updated on-chain figures indicate that liquidity entering major trading venues declined sharply over the span of just a few weeks, underscoring a cooling in overall market activity. Coinbase, often used as a proxy for institutional and US-based flows, saw seven-day cumulative inflows fall to roughly $7.8 billion. That represents a steep drop of more than 60% compared with inflow levels observed in late November. Binance also experienced a contraction, but the decline was materially less severe, with inflows totaling about $10.3 billion over the same period. As a result, Binance surpassed Coinbase in net inflows during December, reversing the earlier dynamic. This divergence suggests that while broad liquidity has tightened, trading activity has become more concentrated on venues associated with shorter-term positioning and active risk management. At the same time, the absence of a significant price reaction highlights how Bitcoin has continued to trade sideways even as fresh capital flows slowed. Taken together, the data points to a market operating with reduced turnover and lower urgency on both the buy and sell side. Bitcoin’s ability to remain range-bound amid shrinking inflows reflects a quieter, more constrained liquidity environment compared with conditions seen just one month earlier. Related Reading: Ethereum Market Structure Strengthens: Binance Netflows Point to Long-Term Conviction BTC Slips Below Key Moving Averages as Daily Trend Weakens Bitcoin is trading near the $87,900 level on the daily chart, extending a corrective move that began after the failed breakout above $120,000 earlier in the quarter. The structure now reflects a clear shift in short-term trend dynamics, with price firmly below its major daily moving averages. Notably, Bitcoin has lost the 111-day and 200-day simple moving averages. Both of which have started to roll over and act as dynamic resistance rather than support. The rejection from the $110,000–$115,000 zone marked a decisive lower high, followed by an impulsive sell-off toward the mid-$80,000 range. Since then, price action has compressed into a narrow consolidation, suggesting temporary stabilization rather than a confirmed reversal. However, the inability to reclaim the declining moving averages indicates that upside attempts remain fragile. Related Reading: Ethereum Traders Chase Upside With Historic Leverage – Breakout Fuel Or Fragile Setup? Volume behavior adds to the cautious outlook. Selling pressure expanded during the initial breakdown, while subsequent rebounds have occurred on muted volume, signaling limited conviction from buyers. This imbalance suggests that dip-buying demand is present but not strong enough to force a trend shift. From a technical perspective, the $85,000–$88,000 area has become a critical near-term support zone. A sustained hold could allow for range formation. Failure to defend this level would increase the risk of a deeper retracement. For sentiment to improve, Bitcoin would need to reclaim the $95,000–$100,000 region and stabilize above its key daily averages. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Why This Market Analyst Is Advising XRP Investors Not To Sell Their Coins",
    "body": "A growing part of the XRP community is paying closer attention to infrastructure changes taking shape on the XRP Ledger, especially as they relate to long-term utility and institutional adoption. That context explains why crypto market commentator Brad Kimes, widely known on X as Digital Perspectives, reiterated a long-standing message that continues to resonate with many XRP holders: “Never sell your XRP.” His comment was in anticipation of the upcoming XRPL Lending Protocol. Why You Shouldn’t Sell Your XRP The comment from Digital Perspectives was a response to a post from Ed Hennis, a software engineer at Ripple, who recently outlined the upcoming proposal for the XRPL Lending Protocol. The proposal introduces fixed-term, fixed-rate, underwritten credit directly at the protocol level of the XRP Ledger. This approach is interesting because it moves lending away from smart-contract layers into a standardized, protocol-native system governed by validator consensus. Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Keeps Crashing According to the explanation by Ed Hennis, the proposed loans on the XRPL Lending Protocol are going to be done with structured, clear terms, predictable interest, and explicit authorization, features that real-world institutions expect before committing capital. Therefore, Digital Perspectives’ “never sell” message is a reflection of a longer-term view where holders never sell their XRP and instead use them as collateral for loans. Instead of relying on generalized liquidity pools like most lending protocols, the design of the XRPL Lending Protocol places each loan inside a segregated Single Asset Vault. This structure isolates risk to a specific credit facility and avoids the cross-contamination that has plagued many DeFi lending platforms during periods of market stress. Therefore, the XRPL Lending Protocol reduces execution risk and creates a framework that resembles traditional credit markets more closely than existing crypto lending models. Real-World Applications Of The XRPL Lending Protocol Most decentralized lending systems today depend on heavy overcollateralization to offset volatility and the risk of anonymity. That approach might work for traders, but it is inefficient for real businesses that operate on predictable cash flows and underwritten credit lines. Enterprises are accustomed to borrowing without locking up more capital than the value of the loan itself, and that mismatch has kept many institutions on the sidelines. Related Reading: Ripple Reveals How It’s Hijacking A $16 Trillion Industry Using The XRP Ledger The XRPL’s approach introduces undercollateralized, institutionally underwritten lending alongside existing overcollateralized models. This expands the range of viable borrowers and aligns on-chain credit with how financing actually works in traditional markets. As noted by Hennis, real-world use cases of XRPL’s lending protocol include market makers borrowing XRP/RLUSD for inventory and arbitrage, Payment Service Providers (PSPs) borrowing RLUSD to pre-fund instant merchant payouts, and fintech lenders accessing short-duration working capital. The feature is slated to be available for voting at the end of January 2026. From there, the voting decision is up to validators on the XRP Ledger. Once the lending protocol goes live and XRP begins to play a direct role in institutional credit markets, selling XRP at that stage may be short-sighted.

    "title": "Solana Enters A Low-Interest Phase After November 2024 All-Time High — Here’s Why",
    "body": "The story of Solana has shifted from a meteoric rise to a high-stakes battle for relevance. After reaching a historic all-time high in November 2024, the network has struggled to reclaim its former momentum. This loss of momentum reflects technical exhaustion and a market recalibration after an aggressive run-up. Thus, SOL has entered a new phase as investors assess whether fresh demand can emerge or if the network needs a new catalyst to reassert leadership. How Solana Momentum Fades After The November Peak Crypto trader Ardi has revealed on X that market interest has noticeably thinned ever since Solana set its $296 all-time high in November 2024. On-chain data has shown that buying pressure has been dominated almost by the retail-sized wallets, particularly those making purchases between $0 and $1,000. Related Reading: Solana Faces Critical Test Near $100 as Macro Pressure and Network Upgrades Collide Ardi argues that while many observers point to micro conditions to explain the stalled price action, the tape reveals that the distribution has begun before the peak. The selling volume had already been accelerating for months before October 10, signaling that major players were planning their exits long before the drawdown. The data also confirms a massive divergence between demographics. Meanwhile, the mid-sized wallets involving $0 to $100,000, and the institutional-sized wallets involving $100,000 to $10 million in volume have been in a steady downtrend for roughly 13 months. Over the same period, retail wallets have shown a consistent uptrend, and are clearly convinced that SOL is still trading at a deep discount price. This imbalance leads to the ultimate question: Is Solana’s value now intrinsically tied to memecoins? The correlation between SOL’s demand and the memecoin actively on the network has been near-perfect, which means that without the frenzy of the meme sector, most bids would largely be disinterested. What Comes After Memes Will Decide Solana’s Future An investor and trader, Jas pointed out that 2025 has definitely been a reset for Solana, but it isn’t over for the altcoin. SOL active monthly traders have fallen from roughly 30 million to under 1 million, a staggering 97% drop in network activity. The speculative engine was the memecoin boom that fueled its rise and also exposed its biggest vulnerability. Related Reading: Solana at a Breaking Point: Fading Memecoin Hype and Alameda Unlocks Test the $140 Support Zone Furthermore, SOL is down nearly 58% from its yearly high. SOL’s network revenue dropped fivefold year-over-year from $2.5 billion in 2024 to $500 million in 2025. The contrast with Ethereum is hard to ignore, and ETH generated $1.4 billion in revenue this year and outperformed SOL by 56% year-to-date. “SOL’s future may depend less on memes and more on what follows them,” Jas noted.

    "title": "These Five Key Drivers Could Boost XRP To $5 By 2026, Claims Top Analyst",
    "body": "XRP, currently the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has recently fallen below the crucial $2 mark amid a broader market correction that has dampened investor sentiment since October. However, market analyst Sam Daodu has identified five critical catalysts that could drive the altcoin to new all-time highs of $5 by 2026. Potential Bullish Catalysts For XRP In a detailed report, Daodu emphasized that for XRP to reach $5, multiple specific factors need to work in unison. Each of these catalysts aims to address various barriers that have kept XRP’s price stagnant. At the forefront of Daodu’s analysis is the potential for a BlackRock-backed XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). Since mid-November 2025, spot XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in cumulative inflows. Should BlackRock move forward with its ETF, estimates suggest that inflows could exceed $2 billion. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecasts For 2026 Unveiled By AI Simulation: Should Investors Remain Bullish? Daodu’s analysis points that such capital influx would not only reshape market demand but would also solidify XRP’s position as the sole cryptocurrency tied to a fully regulated token in the United States, significantly enhancing its case for reaching $5. Next on the list is the evolving significance of Japan within the XRP narrative. Ripple, in collaboration with SBI Holdings, is set to launch RLUSD—Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin—in Japan by the first quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approval. The use of RLUSD on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) can create substantial demand for XRP as a bridge currency, supporting the case for it to reach $5, even if this impact unfolds gradually over time. From Tokenization To ETFs The third catalyst that Daodu identified is the tokenization of assets. Ripple’s expanded partnership with Archax aims to bring in “hundreds of millions of dollars” in tokenized equity, debt, and funds onto the XRP Ledger by mid-2026. Should the XRP Ledger capture even a modest 5-10% of the tokenized asset settlement market, the demand for XRP would increase significantly, further supporting its goal of reaching $5. In fourth place, macroeconomic policy plays a crucial role in shaping XRP’s upside potential. Anticipated rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) would likely decrease returns on cash and short-term bonds, traditionally driving capital toward riskier assets that offer growth and liquidity. Related Reading: New Crypto Tax Proposal: Bipartisan House Duo Pushes For Stablecoin Safe Harbor Lastly, recent on-chain data points to a noteworthy change in supply dynamics. Exchange-held XRP has decreased, with 1.35 billion XRP removed from exchanges in less than two months. Balances plummeted from approximately 3.95 billion tokens to about 2.6 billion, with more than a billion leaving in just a short span of three weeks. Such withdrawals are indicative of a behavioral shift among holders, as many are opting to move XRP into long-term storage solutions. Daodu posits that reaching the $5 mark will not stem from a singular headline or moment of exuberance. It will necessitate a convergence of multiple factors, including strong ETF inflows, institutional adoption, and favorable macroeconomic conditions. As of this writing, the altcoin was trading at $1.88, dropping by almost 50% from all-time high levels reached back in July of this year. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Ignore Dogecoin Now, Chase It Later: This Fractal Says History May Repeat",
    "body": "Dogecoin may look quiet and unexciting right now, but history suggests that could be the point. Similar fractal setups in the past have shown that prolonged accumulation phases often precede explosive moves, rewarding patience rather than impulse. If the pattern holds, DOGE’s current calm could simply be the setup before the next major chase begins. A Familiar Fractal Emerges At A Critical Inflection Point According to a latest Dogecoin update by Cryptollica, the broader macro structure is beginning to mirror a familiar historical four-point fractal structure, with price action now sitting at Point 4. This phase closely resembles past pre-bull-run accumulation periods, where extended consolidation laid the groundwork for explosive upside moves. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holds The Floor, But Momentum Says Otherwise — A Critical Standoff Unfolds The first key element of the setup is the rounded bottom formation. Zones 1 and 2 represented long stretches of low volatility and market boredom, and where accumulation took place quietly. Notably, Zone 2 acted as the launchpad for Dogecoin’s powerful 2021 rally. In the current Zone 4, price behavior is once again stabilizing into a rounded base, suggesting a similar accumulation process is underway. Furthermore, the weekly RSI shows a recurring support zone around the 32 level, marked by a red baseline on the chart. Historically, each time RSI dropped to or hovered near the baseline of Points 1, 2, and 3, it marked a macro bottom. At present, RSI has returned to this same critical support area. This reset implies that selling pressure is fading while momentum conditions are aligning for a potential shift back in favor of buyers. Taken together, this setup points to a cyclical reset rather than random market noise. With a bullish rounding bottom in place and RSI sitting at a historical buy zone, the structure suggests Dogecoin may be entering a prime accumulation phase. If the fractal unfolds as it did in past cycles, the current calm could precede a strong impulsive move. $0.138: The Line That Separates Recovery From Stagnation In a more recent update, crypto analyst Kevin explained that a successful reclaim of the $0.138 level on the 3-day to weekly timeframes would mark a major shift for Dogecoin. Such a move would place price back above the macro 0.382 Fibonacci level as well as the 200-week simple moving average. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds This development would be a strong bullish signal, but it is unlikely to happen in isolation. The setup would most likely align with Bitcoin reclaiming the crucial $88,000–$91,000 zone, a range that needs to be recovered to support broader market strength and risk-on momentum. Until those conditions are met, Dogecoin continues to chop within what is considered a long-term dollar-cost-averaging zone, suggesting consolidation persists while the market waits for a decisive macro trigger.

    "title": "More Pain For Ethereum? Head And Shoulder Pattern Signals $2,400 Breakdown",
    "body": "After being rejected from the $3,000 level, Ethereum (ETH) is trying to hold a key support zone and build a base around this area. Some analysts have suggested that the altcoin must reclaim the crucial resistance soon or risk potential drop to new multi-month lows. Related Reading: XRP ETFs Record 25-Day Streak As Price Eyes Key Resistance Level Ethereum Forms Head And Shoulder Pattern Amid the broader market volatility, Ethereum has been attempting to hold the recently reclaimed $2,900 level as support to potentially challenge higher resistance levels in the coming days. The cryptocurrency has been trading within the $2,800-$3,400 price range over the past month, hitting a high of $3,447 nearly two weeks ago. Since reaching the local high, ETH has struggled to hold the range’s high, falling to the lows again during last week’s market correction. Amid this performance, the King of Altcoins is currently registering its worst Q4 performance since 2019, with a negative performance of 28.76%. Moreover, it is also recording a red December so far, trading 1.3% below its monthly opening of $2,991. Some analysts have warned that ETH’s pain may not be over, as it appears to be forming a pattern that could spell trouble for the cryptocurrency. In a Tuesday X post, Ali Martinez suggested that Ethereum started forming a head and shoulder pattern following the massive corrections that the send most cryptocurrencies to multi-month lows. Per the chart, the altcoin formed the left shoulder between late November and early December after bouncing from the $2,780 support. Meanwhile, the pattern’s head was formed during the mid-December rebound that led to the $3,400 local high. Now, as price is rejected from the $3,000 area again, the cryptocurrency appears to be forming the right shoulder. This suggests that ETH’s price could drop to the $2,800 area to complete the pattern’s formation. Martinez noted that if the pattern is completed, it could lead to a 15% potential move toward $2,400, a level not seen since the start of the Q3 breakout. ETH Price In Trouble? Other market observers suggested Ethereum could be in trouble after being rejected from the $3,000 barrier again. Ted Pillows noted that the altcoin tried to reclaim this level but failed, closing Monday around the $2,948 area. To the analyst, If ETH doesn’t reclaim this key barrier soon, it could likely drop towards the $2,700-$2,800 support zone. On the contrary, a daily close above this level would set the base for a rally toward the $3,300 level. Similarly, Sjuul from AltCryptoGems affirmed that Ethereum “is a bit in trouble after that nasty bearish deviation on top of the range.” He highlighted the altcoin’s rejection from the mid-December highs, which sent the price the lower zone of its one-month range. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s 53,000% Surge Shows Renewed Interest, But Why Is DOGE Price Lagging? Based on this, the analyst suggested that investors could expect “the same to happen on the lower band,” which would see the price retest the $2,600-$2,700 area, and drop as low as $2,400, before bouncing toward the range highs again. Nonetheless, Sjuul declared that “bulls need to establish a proper uptrend here because losing $2700 would be a negative sign.” As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,933, a 2.53% decline in the daily timeframe.

    "title": "Reasons Why The Ethereum Price Will Continue To Crash",
    "body": "Coming out of the weekend, the Ethereum price had attempted another recovery alongside Bitcoin, but eventually, the recovery attempt failed again. Taking to TradingView, crypto analyst DomicChaina explains what is happening behind this phenomenon and why the Ethereum price is unlikely to see any meaningful recovery. As it stands, it seems the leading altcoin is more likely to suffer a rejection toward new monthly lows than actually stage a rebound. Technical Factors Drive Ethereum Price Further Down The crypto analyst highlights some technical developments that point to the Ethereum price being stuck in a bearish phase. One of the major ones has to do with both the EMA34 and the EMA89. According to the analyst, the price performance in relation to these two EMAs suggests that the downtrend will continue. Related Reading: Why This Market Analyst Is Advising XRP Investors Not To Sell Their Coins For one, the EMA39 had actually crossed below the EMA84, and at the same time, both of these moving averages have been moving downward. This means that despite recovery efforts, it still puts the Ethereum price in a medium-term downtrend. Chaina adds that this means that the current trend is sideways or a basing process, rather than pointing downward. For there to be any meaningful recovery, the Ethereum price would have to break out of this range. However, as long as it continues to maintain this structure, then the expectation is that the altcoin will continue to decline, moving toward the next major support at $2,500. Resistance Remains Strong In addition to the overall trend pointing downward, there is also the issue of mounting resistance at $3,090, coinciding with the EMA34. So far, this resistance has been the death of multiple recovery attempts, with the latest being stopped in its tracks earlier this week as well. With the EMA89 also pointing downward, it means that the price is likely to decline and then recover from here. Related Reading: Why This Friday Could Be Very Big For The Bitcoin Price The analysis also highlights the declining volume as evidence that capital inflows into the altcoin remain weak. With the holidays, this is not expected to change as investors move away from the market to focus on the celebrations. “This week falls into a holiday period, leading to reduced market liquidity, which makes price movements more sluggish and lacking breakout momentum,” the post read. Recovery candles also remaining very short and brief show a stifling of the recovery attempts so far, and those that could follow. For now, the Ethereum price continues to trend below $3,000, recording a 37% decline from its 2025 all-time highs. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin Price Could Rally If It Reclaims This Fibonacci Level",
    "body": "The Dogecoin price is currently trading within a tight range as analysts evaluate its next potential move. Recent technical analysis has focused on specific price levels that could influence future movement. They suggest that a shift in broader crypto momentum, combined with a crucial Fibonacci level reclaim, may set the stage for a renewed, explosive upside for DOGE. Dogecoin Price Faces Key Test At $0.138 Dogecoin has been trending downwards for months now, as it faces pressure from ongoing volatility and an overall market slowdown. Although DOGE’s price remains below $0.13 after declining consistently over the past few months, crypto market analyst Kevin has outlined conditions under which the meme coin’s price could recover and see a strong upside soon. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Bitcoin Make Or Break Level Amid Campaign For $90,000 In an X post on Tuesday, Kevin pointed to the $0.138 level as a critical area that must be reclaimed on a strong higher time frame three-day to one week closes. According to his view, such a move would mark a meaningful shift in Dogecoin’s momentum and signal renewed strength after an extended period of consolidation. He also disclosed that a recovery would open the door to a potentially massive price rally for the meme coin. The analyst explained that reclaiming the $0.138 level would place Dogecoin back above a key macro Fibonacci retracement around 0.382. This Fibonacci level has acted as an important dividing line between bearish and bullish market phases in the past. As a result, a move above it could suggest that long-term buyers are regaining control. Kevin also emphasized the significance of the 200-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the chart, noting that it often serves as a key support or resistance level during significant trend changes. A decisive move above this key level would validate the analyst’s bullish perspective, signaling that Dogecoin could be nearing the end of its correction and preparing to transition into a stronger market phase. Notably, once this structural change occurs, Kevin’s chart points to the next major liquidity and resistance zone, which sits around $0.46. Dogecoin Price Rally Tied To Bitcoin’s Momentum In his accompanying chart, Kevin shows that Dogecoin is currently trading sideways within what appears to be a DCA zone. This range reflects extended consolidation where price has failed to make a decisive move in either direction. Related Reading: Analyst Shares ‘Cold, Hard Truth’ For Bitcoin Investors As Price Struggles The chart setup suggests that any meaningful breakout in Dogecoin’s price would likely coincide with renewed strength in Bitcoin. Kevin notes that Bitcoin reclaiming the $88,000 to $91,000 region could support bullish momentum across the crypto market and influence a potential price rally for Dogecoin. A move toward this range would require the leading cryptocurrency to rally by approximately 2-6% from its present price level. Without that confirmation, the analyst believes that DOGE may continue consolidating within its current narrow range. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "The Dogecoin Cycle Fractal That Shows Where The Price Is Headed Next",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Cryptollica has pointed to a Dogecoin cycle fractal, which shows where the DOGE price may be headed next. This came as the analyst provided a bullish outlook for the top meme coin and indicated that this was a good time for investors to buy DOGE. Dogecoin Cycle Fractal Shows DOGE’s Bull Run Is Imminent In an X post, Cryptollica indicated that Dogecoin was at the point before it begins its bull run, with the accompanying chart showing that the meme coin could still rally above $1. The analyst noted that the cycle fractal has repeated itself at the macro level, with their chart highlighting four distinct structural points. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s 53,000% Surge Shows Renewed Interest, But Why Is DOGE Price Lagging? Cryptollica revealed that Dogecoin is currently at Point 4 and that the structure is rhyming perfectly with the pre-bull run accumulation phases of the past. The analyst then broke down the patterns observed in this cycle fractal. The first is the ‘Rounding Bottoms,’ with Zones 1 and 2 being the “boredom phases” in which volatility died and smart money accumulated. Zone 2 is said to be the launchpad for the massive 2021 parabolic run for Dogecoin. Meanwhile, Zone 4 is the current price action, with Cryptollica noting that the same rounding-bottom formation is playing out. The analyst added that the DOGE price is stabilizing and forming a heavy base just like it did before the previous explosions. Cryptollica then highlighted Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), noting that the 32 level acts as a historical floor. The analyst explained that the DOGE price has formed a macro bottom every single time the weekly RSI touched or hovered near this baseline. The RSI is said to have reset back to this critical support level, indicating that sellers are exhausted and the momentum is primed to flip. DOGE Is In The “Golden Pocket” For Accumulation Cryptollica stated that the cycle fractal isn’t just random noise but a cyclical reset, as the chart suggests that Dogecoin is in the Golden Pocket for accumulation. The analyst further remarked that if the fractal plays out as it did in 2020, in Zone 2, then the current DOGE price action is simply the calm before the storm. Related Reading: Dogecoin Reclaiming $0.128 Support Could Signal The Perfect Chance For Long Positions Cryptollica again highlighted the technical structure, noting that a bullish rounding bottom was forming for Dogecoin while the RSI was at a historical oversold support level, which is a buy zone. The analyst declared that the spring is loading and that patience is required, but that the setup points to a major impulsive move that is on the horizon. In line with this, Cryptollica urged investors to “buy Dogecoin.” At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.127, down almost 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "How XRP Is Approaching A Structural Break That Could Change Everything",
    "body": "After years of compression, XRP is quietly approaching a moment where the market will see a true structural break. This breakout is about a high-timeframe setup where market structure is on the verge of shifting. It is also the potential resolution of a multi-year structure that has compressed prices, absorbed supply, and conditioned participants to underestimate what comes next. Why Volatility Has Collapsed Ahead Of Expansion At the least expected time, XRP will print a legendary candle that will set a structural foundation and never move down. A crypto investor known as 24HRSCRYPTO noted on X that this move that is coming won’t be powered by retail hype, but by real economic activity on the XRP Ledger. When the altcoin begins to function as a settlement asset, volatility will become a liability, rather than a feature. Related Reading: Banks Could Favor A Higher XRP Price, Finance Expert Says Additionally, the payment rails, liquidity provisioning, and institutional settlement system will require price stability. A bridge asset referred to as a vehicle currency cannot swing 30-40% and still clear trillions in value. As volume and utility increase, XRP begins to transition from a speculative instrument into market infrastructure. Liquidity depth would be key to absorb shocks, while the price becomes anchored by demand. This is why the first candle isn’t a top, but the market repricing XRP’s role from a tradeable asset into a financial primitive. With new initiatives, XRP’s adoption is set to increase. Analyst X Finance Bull has revealed that RLUSD is the first US trust-regulated stablecoin launched by Ripple, issued natively on the XRP Ledger and extending across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains for broader institutional access. Any banks that would integrate with RLUSD will be automatically onboarded into the XRP rails. This isn’t just about stable payments, but about demand generation for the altcoin as the default bridge asset. From BlackRock funds flow to global repo markets, that’s where the real volume begins to flow. This flips the game, allowing RLUSD to provide the liquidity, while XRP captures the movement. Why XRPL Meets Institutional Due Diligence Standards For the first time, XRP Ledger has now processed over 4 billion transactions since its launch in 2012. Co-founder of Tedlabsio, a crypto trader and investor, Niels, has pointed out that the real-world usage across the network has sustained more than 13 years of uninterrupted operation. Related Reading: Here’s How Many Transactions XRP Must Process To Reach A $2,000 Price Tag The XRPL consistently handles around 1.5 million transactions per day, with regular peaks exceeding 5 million, and settles in 3 to 5 seconds. All of this happens at fractions of a cent per transaction. Over time, more than 13 million XRP have been burned in transaction fees, a metric that reflects continuous demand in network activity. This is why institutions pay attention to XRPL. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "$130 Million XRP Fumble: Analyst Reveals What Went Wrong",
    "body": "A crypto analyst has revealed how a well-timed XRP investment from the 2017 bull cycle turned into a missed $130 million opportunity, highlighting how execution failures can derail even the most promising strategies. The admission, shared publicly on X, has reignited debate over discipline, timing, and emotional control in long-term crypto investing. XRP’s Perfect Entry, Failed Exit The investment began with a disciplined entry. In early 2017, two participants collectively invested $1,200 into XRP at approximately $0.007, accumulating 171,428 tokens. From a market timing perspective, the entry was near optimal. XRP later surged during the cycle, briefly trading close to its peak and lifting the position’s value to roughly $770,000. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Bitcoin Make Or Break Level Amid Campaign For $90,000 At this stage, the trade had already achieved what most investors aim for: asymmetric upside realized within a single market cycle. However, the position was never exited. Despite clear signs of market euphoria and a dramatic expansion in price, the gains remained unrealized. The analyst later acknowledged that hesitation and emotional attachment prevented decisive action, effectively transforming a winning trade into a missed opportunity. This hesitation exposed a structural weakness in the strategy: there was no enforced exit discipline. While the entry was carefully planned, the decision to sell depended on the moments when emotional pressures are strongest and risk perception is most skewed. The scenario highlights a recurring issue in crypto markets, where many investors focus heavily on asset selection and timing entries, yet underestimate how psychologically demanding exits can be during periods of rapid price growth. The Missed Rotation And Compounding Effect Of Inaction The second failure compounded the first. The analyst explained that selling XRP near its peak would have freed capital to redeploy into Bitcoin while BTC traded around $1,000. That move could have converted the XRP proceeds into roughly 771 Bitcoin, effectively positioning the portfolio to benefit from the next major phase of the market cycle. Related Reading: Analyst Shares ‘Cold, Hard Truth’ For Bitcoin Investors As Price Struggles Holding those Bitcoin through later highs—approaching 170,000 CAD—would have resulted in total proceeds exceeding $130 million. The strategy was simple and systematic: take profits from an outperforming asset and rotate into another with asymmetric upside potential. It required no leverage, no complex instruments, and no precise market timing beyond a broad understanding of overall market cycles. However, hesitation, second-guessing, and attachment to the original position prevented decisive action. By delaying the rotation, the investor forfeited the compounding advantage, leaving the portfolio largely static while the broader market continued to advance. The analyst’s reflection highlights how the crypto market consistently rewards preparation and disciplined execution but punishes hesitation. This experience serves as a stark reminder that the ability to act decisively at critical moments is often the true determinant of long-term success in crypto investing.

    "title": "Why Has The Solana Price Been In A Steady Downtrend Since January?",
    "body": "Solana’s price action this year has followed a clear but uncomfortable pattern. After pushing to a new all-time high around the $296 region in January, the rally quickly lost momentum and transitioned into a steady decline that has persisted for months. Many traders have attributed this weakness to a risk-off sentiment across crypto, but a deeper on-chain breakdown shared by crypto analyst Ardi on X suggests the story began well before the January peak and has more to do with who was buying and who was quietly exiting. Distribution Was Already Underway Before The January Peak Solana has been on a clear downtrend since September, when it reached a lower high of around $247 compared to its January 19 all-time high of $293. One of the most important insights from Ardi’s analysis is that Solana’s January all-time high did not mark the start of distribution but rather the culmination of it.

This Major SOL Player Is Selling The chart attached to his post shows that selling volume was already increasing months earlier, well ahead of October, meaning that large holders were positioning for exits long before price reached its final peak. From that perspective, the January high looks less like the beginning of a new expansion phase and more like the last push of a rally. After that point, price action began forming lower highs, and each rebound attempt lacked the strength needed to reclaim the all-time high. Interestingly, Solana failed to reach a new all-time high, even as other large market cap cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and BNB pushed to new all-time highs during the year. Another interesting feature of the data is the widening gap between retail behavior and that of larger players. Cumulative delta metrics on the chart show that retail-sized wallets have been consistently active throughout the year and are increasing their activity even as Solana’s price moved lower. On the other hand, mid-sized and institutional wallets tell a very different story. Their activity has been trending downward for months, starting from the January peak and extending up until the time of writing. Is Solana’s Price Becoming Dependent On Memecoin Activity? Ardi’s analysis also raises a broader question about what is currently driving demand for Solana. Outside of retail activity on Solana itself, one of the few consistent sources of activity has been the memecoin sector. Successes and booms of meme coins like Cat in a Dogs World (MEW), Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), which gained traction in the second half of 2024, contributed to Solana’s push to all-time highs during those periods.

Revenue Numbers Show Disturbing Trend Those meme coin successes culminated with the launch of the Official Trump ($TRUMP) token in January 2025 on Solana, which experienced eye-watering gains shortly after its launch. This, in turn, contributed to Solana’s all-time high in January. However, since then, the TRUMP token and other Solana-based meme coins have been trending downwards in recent months and no longer command the same level of attention or trading intensity they had this time last year. That has led to the view that Solana’s price is increasingly sensitive to the success of memecoins in its ecosystem. At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $121.50, down by about 58.6% from its January all-time high of $293. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",
