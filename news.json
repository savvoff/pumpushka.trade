    "title": "Can Dogecoin Really Fall To $0.05 In 2026? This Analyst Thinks So",
    "body": "Dogecoin traders have heard the “five-cent” call before. It’s the kind of number that sounds like bait until price action starts behaving like it might actually get there. On Friday, DOGE was changing hands around $0.140, up slightly on the day, while bitcoin hovered near $92,300. That’s the backdrop for a fresh warning from YouTube analyst VisionPulsed, who told viewers his “base case” is that Dogecoin revisits the $0.05–$0.06 zone over the next 12 months — a window that drags the target straight into 2026. Will Dogecoin Crash To $0.05 In 2026? In the video posted on December 11 and titled “WHY IS DOGECOIN CRASHING!? BITCOIN RALLY COMING OR BULL TRAP FOR 5 CENT DOGE in 2026!?, the gist of his argument is pretty simple: if bitcoin is in a bear regime, DOGE doesn’t need an extra reason to bleed. “The base case here is that Bitcoin has entered a bear market,” he said, pointing to a cluster of indicators he watches, including an 8-day moving average near $102,000 and the Gaussian Channel. As long as BTC sits below those levels — he cited roughly $103,000 as a line in the sand — he thinks the path of least resistance for Dogecoin trends down toward five cents. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds And he wasn’t exactly selling it as a clean, one-way trip. There’s a lot of “chop zone” talk in the video — his term for the period where traders get whipsawed trying to long bounces and short dips. “The peanut gallery,” he called it. His chart-based rationale leans on a familiar pattern from 2022: even when bitcoin managed a relief rally, DOGE still printed lower lows at points. “There is no guarantee that Dogecoin will have a relief rally. As you can see, in 2022, Dogecoin did indeed have a relief rally for the final pump with Bitcoin, but you can also see that Bitcoin made higher lows throughout the spring as Dogecoin made lower lows,” he said. In his view, one of those “unfinished” spots sits closer to $0.10 first — and then the uglier number comes back into play depending on how bitcoin behaves. That sequencing matters because it’s exactly where traders get themselves into trouble. If bitcoin bounces, DOGE might bounce too. Or it might not. VisionPulsed kept hammering that there are “many indicators” suggesting a BTC relief rally is possible, but “no guarantees” Dogecoin participates — a point he tried to underline by comparing the current tape to MicroStrategy’s tendency to go flat for weeks before a sharp move. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Volatility Returns as Market Weighs Bullish Indicators Against Recent Dip Then there’s his timing framework, which is more narrative than math but still widely used in crypto circles: the idea that around 140–150 days from a major top, markets often produce a final meaningful rally — and then price doesn’t revisit those levels for a long time. He cited examples across prior cycles (2014, 2018, 2019, 2022) to argue that once bitcoin falls into that “channel” regime, it tends to stay there until the broader downtrend has done its work. So what does $0.05 actually mean from here? From roughly $0.14, it’s a drawdown of about 64%. That’s violent, but not exactly exotic in DOGE history — which is why the call lands with some traders even if they hate hearing it. The big escape hatch, per VisionPulsed, is a bitcoin breakout: if BTC makes a new all-time high by February, he argues the bearish “base case” gets invalidated and DOGE can do what DOGE does when the market turns risk-on. Until then, he framed $0.05–$0.06 as the boring, brutal probability-weighted outcome. “So the base case for the next 12 months is essentially at some point Doge will most likely come down to these five to six cent range unless Bitcoin goes up and makes a new alltime high before February. If Bitcoin makes a new all-time high by February, then Doge will avoid that [$0.05 target] and start pumping to the moon like everybody wants,” he concluded. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.14.

    "body": "Crypto markets saw a modest lift after the US Federal Reserve made another move on rates, and traders are watching for a clearer follow-through. According to reports, the Fed has carried out three consecutive interest rate cuts totaling 0.75% from September to December. The move was widely expected. Still, market responses have been mixed and somewhat choppy. Related Reading: American Bitcoin Makes Big Buy, Adds 416 BTC To Its Stack Fed Moves And Market Takeaway According to CoinEx chief analyst Jeff Ko, much of the Fed’s action was already priced in, and the updated dot plot leaned a bit more hawkish than some had hoped. Ko pointed to $40 billion in short-term Treasury purchases as a technical step to ease liquidity and lower short-term rates, not as a broad stimulus program. Markets took the measures as mildly positive. US stocks rose, and that helped Bitcoin find some footing after an early dip. Santiment And The Short-Term Reaction Based on reports from onchain analytics firm Santiment, each cut has prompted a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” move where initial optimism is followed by short selling. 🇺🇸 The US Fed made three strategic cuts over the past 3 months, resulting in a total of an 0.75% reduction to interest rates. 1⃣ September 17, 2025: Fed lowered the target range to 4.00 %–4.25 % (from 4.25 %+) at the 16–17 Sep meeting. 2⃣ October 29, 2025: Fed cut the rate to… pic.twitter.com/X6DWypvq5t — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 11, 2025 Cuts are seen as bullish for crypto over the long haul, yet they have triggered brief pullbacks in practice. Santiment adds that a small wave of FUD or retail selling often signals that the mild post-cut downswing is finished and a bounce may follow once things calm down. Technical Levels Traders Are Watching Bitcoin was volatile in the aftermath. It fell under $90,000 then popped to $93,500 on Coinbase before settling near $92,300 at the time of reporting. Key resistance sits between $97,000 and $108,000. On the daily chart, BTC remains inside a small rising channel that sits within a larger downtrend, and technical traders note that a MACD histogram is approaching a positive crossover — a sign some see as possible renewed momentum. ETF activity has been tepid, with only $219 million in net inflows since late November, which keeps some investors cautious. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher Dollar Weakness And Equity Signals A weaker dollar has been part of the backdrop; the DXY index fell to 98.36 and is showing bearish momentum on its own MACD. Nasdaq’s move back above its 50-, 100- and 200-day simple moving averages helped lift risk assets briefly, and that has supported Bitcoin’s rebound attempts. Yet correlation with equities remains uneven — losses in stocks tend to hit Bitcoin harder than gains help it, creating an asymmetric risk profile for traders.

    "title": "Silk Road Bitcoins Are On The Move Again, Is The BTC Price Ready For Another Dump?",
    "body": "After nearly five years of dormancy, a cluster of Silk Road–linked wallets just moved 33.7 Bitcoin—roughly $3 million—in a sudden on-chain resurgence that immediately brought the BTC price back into focus. While the volume is modest, the combination of its origin, timing, and institutional destination gives it an outsized narrative impact. With Bitcoin already navigating a fragile price range, this development raises concerns about renewed downward pressure. The 33.7 BTC Silk Road BTC Transfer And Its Potential Impact On Bitcoin’s Price The movement began with a series of small outputs originating from early-era Silk Road addresses, all using the old “1…” legacy format. These wallets had last shown activity on February 2, 2021, before abruptly pushing out 176 tiny transactions that were subsequently consolidated into the bech32 address bc1qnysx9sr0s7uw39awr3hh099d5m0lvrnxz7ga54. Roughly a day later, that entire 33.7 BTC was moved again through an intermediary hop and then flagged by chain-analysis dashboards as a Coinbase Prime deposit. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Set To Surge As Sellers Show Signs Of Exhaustion The first alert about the movement came from the X account DarkWebInformer, which spotted the burst of micro-transactions. Even after this transfer, about 416 BTC—roughly $37.5 million—remains untouched in the wider group of connected addresses. This supports the idea that the 33.7 BTC shift was simply a dust-sweep or cleanup action, not a full-scale release of seized holdings. With the operational picture clear, the focus shifts to the price impact. In terms of liquidity, 33.7 BTC is far too small to trigger a market-wide dump. What matters more is the psychological effect. Bitcoin is already trading in a corrective range, and activity linked to Silk Road history can make traders cautious. Although the Coinbase Prime routing points to OTC or custodial handling rather than a spot-market sale, the optics alone can tighten risk models and stoke volatility in the BTC price. Dormant Wallets And Market Sensitivity Dormant Silk Road wallets have a history of resurfacing. In May 2025, two such wallets moved over 3,400 BTC—worth roughly $322 million—after nearly a decade of inactivity. The funds were transferred into new addresses rather than exchanges, showing that these movements do not automatically trigger selling and are more notable for their on-chain and narrative significance than for their impact on liquidity. Related Reading: Pundit Highlights The Condition That Will Trigger A 2,300% XRP Rally To $50 While these transfers have little direct effect on liquidity, Bitcoin’s current price action makes the market more sensitive to any headline. After approaching $94,000 earlier this month, BTC slipped back to $90,000–$92,000. On X, bearish analysts have highlighted a continuation pattern, with some projecting potential downside toward $88,000 – $89,000. This environment primes traders to react strongly to even minor negative catalysts, including long-dormant wallet activity. Overall, the recent Silk Road transfer is unlikely to trigger a standalone dump. The main pressure stems from Bitcoin’s fragile technical posture, making even small but symbolically significant moves capable of increasing short-term volatility.

    "body": "Zcash’s latest price movement has pushed the privacy-focused cryptocurrency back into the spotlight, as momentum builds around a potential breakout from a long-standing resistance zone. Related Reading: What’s Happening With The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Recently? After a sharp climb this week, traders are watching whether ZEC can extend its gains or whether technical pressures will stall the advance. The token surged more than 9% to reach around $455, standing out in a broader market that has mostly moved sideways despite renewed optimism following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest policy signals. Rising demand, shifting fee structures, and notable whale activity have all contributed to ZEC’s strong performance, but the technical picture remains mixed as the asset approaches a critical threshold. ZEC's price shows bullish momentum on the daily chart. Source: ZECUSD on Tradingview Dynamic Fee Proposal and Whale Demand Lift ZEC Zcash’s rally coincides with a key development effort from its contributors. Developers and Shielded Labs proposed transitioning from fixed transaction fees to a dynamic fee market, a change aimed at improving cost efficiency during periods of high activity. Market activity also intensified. Trading volumes rose sharply, and Cypherpunk Technologies expanded its ZEC holdings while adding Zcash founder Zooko Wilcox as an advisor. On-chain data indicated accumulation from large holders, including a wallet that increased its position and sent tokens to Hyperliquid to establish a long exposure. Such behavior has tightened the circulating supply at a moment when ZEC is testing historical resistance. Zcash’s broader performance this year further adds to the current market narrative. The token has posted returns exceeding 600% over the past 12 months, helped by rising investor interest in privacy assets and a constrained supply profile. ZEC Tests Multi-Touch Resistance as Bulls Aim for Continuation Despite the strong surge, Zcash now sits near a resistance zone, roughly between $460 and $485, that has repeatedly halted rallies in previous cycles. Technical readings show improving momentum on lower timeframes, supported by stable RSI levels and a constructive parabolic SAR structure. Spot inflow data has also flipped positive, suggesting buyers are re-entering rather than exiting on strength. If ZEC breaks above the $472–$485 range, analysts note potential upside targets at $506, $556, and possibly even $600–$620. Clearing this region would mark a shift from the most recent lower-high pattern and could accelerate trend continuation. Mixed Long-Term Outlook as New Cycle Signals Emerge However, some longer-term indicators raise caution. Wave analysis from multiple chart views suggests ZEC may have completed a major corrective structure earlier in the cycle, followed by a 60% decline and a weaker recovery. Bearish divergences in momentum tools and a rising parallel channel on shorter timeframes hint that the current bounce could still be corrective. A rejection at the resistance level may lead to a retracement toward $430, followed by the $370–$398 zone. A deeper breakdown could push prices below $300 if bearish structures reassert themselves. Related Reading: Do Kwon Falls Hard — Terraform Labs Chief Gets 15 Years For Wire Fraud For now, Zcash’s price action sits at a pivotal moment. A decisive move above resistance could extend the recent surge, but failure to break through may shift momentum back toward consolidation, or even a broader downtrend.

    "body": "Young Hoon Kim — the social-media personality who styles himself as the “IQ 276” record holder — just gave the XRP crowd a fresh piece of rocket fuel. “I buy XRP from now on,” Kim wrote on X on Friday, in what appears to be his first straight-up XRP shoutout after days of near-constant Bitcoin evangelizing. I buy #XRP from now on. — YoungHoon Kim, IQ 276 (@yhbryankimiq) December 12, 2025 Why The XRP Endorsement Now? And, yeah, the XRP Army did what it always does: it treated the post like a mini event. “The smartest man in the world is buying XRP,” one account, Gordon (@GordonGekko), replied — then immediately stapled the other big narrative of the day onto it: “XRP is now on Solana too. Is this the start of an XRP rally?” That second line isn’t just vibes. Solana’s official account posted “BREAKING: XRP is coming to Solana,” pointing to a wrapped-asset setup that would let XRP trade and move inside Solana DeFi rails. Hex Trust, which is positioning itself as issuer/custodian for the wrapped token (wXRP), says the product is designed to be 1:1 backed and redeemable for native XRP, using LayerZero’s OFT standard and launching “starting with Solana” (with more chains name-checked). Related Reading: Why This Market Analyst Is Warning Crypto Investors To Stop Buying XRP So Kim’s timing, intentional or not, landed right on top of a very convenient distribution channel: “XRP, but DeFi-ready.” If you’re an XRP holder who’s been watching Solana soak up memecoin liquidity and on-chain volume for the past year, that’s an easy story to forward to your group chat. The funny part is Kim’s recent persona has leaned hard into Bitcoin-maxi prophecy. In the last week alone, he made dozens of Bitcoin posts via X. On December 7, he posted: “In my personal view, Bitcoin’s current price is just a temporary discount caused by what seems to be market manipulation. I think any such manipulation may disappear within a week, and then it could start accelerating toward a new ATH.” Just a few days later, on December 10, he wrote: “My analysis suggests that Bitcoin may have set its bottom a few weeks ago, and we could now be entering a true supercycle.” One day later, he added: “”My analysis suggests that Bitcoin reaching 300K in early 2026 is a logical scenario.” Related Reading: XRP Forecast Turns Explosive As Canadian Experts Highlight Massive FinTech Utility Yesterday, Kim posted: “Bitcoin looks ready to break every prediction ever written. The real bull run begins when people think it’s already over,” before adding today: “I think Bitcoin is the money of God” and “In my view, one of the fastest ways to get rich is to stack Bitcoin.” So why the sudden XRP detour? No explanation yet, at least publicly. There’s also the reality that Kim is, politely put, controversial. Korean coverage has described him as being reported as an “IQ 276” holder tied to mind-sports organizations, but the broader profile has drawn scrutiny and debate online, with questions about verifiability and sourcing trailing the “world’s highest IQ” framing. Still, crypto doesn’t really wait for footnotes. A big claim, a big ticker, a hot comment section — and now an XRP-to-Solana headline to glue it together. That’s plenty for a one-day narrative.

Related Reading: What’s Happening With The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Recently? From a high-profile commercial paper issuance to plans for bringing XRP onto Solana, the blockchain is positioning itself at the center of experiments that could reshape how digital assets interact with traditional markets. SOL's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Institutional Activity Accelerates With New Tokenized Bond Deal J.P. Morgan’s arrangement of a $50 million tokenized commercial paper issuance for Galaxy Digital marks one of the clearest signals yet that major financial institutions are warming to public blockchain infrastructure. The short-term debt instrument was issued on Solana, with Coinbase and Franklin Templeton purchasing the tokenized asset, and settlement conducted in USDC. The bank created the on-chain token representing the bond and handled primary settlement, positioning the project as a practical test of how public networks could support regulated financial transactions. The move shows Solana’s growing role in real-world asset tokenization, a sector projected by industry analysts to reach trillions of dollars over the next decade. For Solana, the deal is also a strategic validation. While the chain is widely known for retail and developer activity, institutional adoption has historically been slower to materialize. Seeing a large financial institution test a foundational market instrument on Solana offers a clearer path to deeper enterprise use cases. Solana – XRP Integration Signals Cross-Chain Expansion Alongside the bond issuance, Solana is preparing for the arrival of XRP through a partnership with Hex Trust and LayerZero, which will issue wrapped XRP (wXRP) on the network. The integration aims to extend XRP’s liquidity and utility into Solana’s fast-moving DeFi environment, enabling lending, liquidity provision, and other decentralized applications. Hex Trust confirmed that wXRP will be fully backed 1:1 with native XRP held in segregated custody accounts, supported by more than $100 million in initial liquidity. The addition may also influence XRP’s market structure, as wrapped supply requires native XRP to be locked, potentially tightening liquidity during high-demand periods. For Solana, the asset brings an established user base and deeper liquidity pools. For XRP, the move broadens its utility across high-performance decentralized markets that prioritize low-cost transactions and throughput. A Broader Shift in Market Perception These developments come as industry figures, such as Anthony Scaramucci, publicly reiterate their bullish outlook on Solana, arguing that the network’s growth trajectory could surpass Ethereum’s in market capitalization. While the claim remains speculative, the combination of institutional pilots, cross-chain integrations, and expanding developer activity suggests Solana is strengthening its position as a platform for both consumer and enterprise-grade applications.

    "title": "Dogecoin Tightens Up: Symmetrical Triangle Converges With High-Timeframe Wyckoff Setup",
    "body": "Dogecoin is entering a pivotal phase as its price action tightens within a symmetrical triangle, aligning with a high-timeframe Wyckoff setup. The combination of higher lows, compressed structure, and developing Wyckoff signals suggests growing strength beneath the surface, raising the possibility that DOGE is quietly preparing for its next major move. MTF Range Strategy: Longs At Discount, Shorts At Premium According to an update by Wyckoff Insider via the lens of a multi-timeframe (MTF) range, the focus is on seeking long positions in areas of extreme discount and short positions in areas of extreme premium. When an MTF range is present, it often develops a Wyckoff structure near both the range highs and lows, providing clearer points of interest for traders. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds Dogecoin is currently forming an 8H Bojan pivot in the extreme discount zone of this MTF range. The key to trading a Bojan pivot is identifying the Sign of Strength (SOS) that forms on the third candle. Bitcoin displayed a similar 8H Bojan recently, but trading it was more challenging due to deviations on both sides of the range, making DOGE difficult to trade also. On the lower timeframes, Dogecoin is also showing a Wyckoff Model 1 range. When the third candle opens, and price pulls down, traders look for an LPS, BOS, and internal BOS pattern. Valid entries include taking the breakout on the 3-minute BOS with a stop below the M1 low, or entering on the LPS after the internal BOS, with a stop placed beneath the LPS itself. In terms of trade management, Wyckoff Insider outlines a clear plan: risk should be kept at 2% per setup, with TP1 at the Wyckoff target zone (40%), and TP2 at the first range supply, fully closing the trade once a Sign of Weakness (SOW) appears. This structured approach helps navigate DOGE’s multi-layered Wyckoff-driven price action with discipline and clarity. Daily Structure Shows Strength Despite Downtrend Trader Tardigrade revealed that the daily chart provides clear indications that Dogecoin is actively building a stronger market structure despite the recent overall downtrend. This strength is apparent when comparing the current price action to past cycles. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Volatility Returns as Market Weighs Bullish Indicators Against Recent Dip Historically, when the broader market is weak, DOGE typically reinforces its bearish trend by forming lower lows following a distinct new swing low. However, in a significant departure from this pattern, DOGE is now attempting to establish a higher lows structure within a symmetrical triangle pattern. This formation is key, as the analyst suggests the symmetrical triangle structure indicates that Dogecoin has been rejected from trading further downward. Such a development signals that selling exhaustion is setting in, preparing the market for a potential directional breakout. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "XRP Whale Activity Spikes At The Bottom – A Classic Pre-Rally Signal",
    "body": "XRP has been under clear pressure in recent sessions, sliding toward its lowest price of the year as the broader crypto market continues to absorb heavy selling. Sentiment remains fragile, and many traders have shifted into defensive positioning while awaiting clearer macro signals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Refuse to Sell: Historic Signal Emerges As Binance CDD Drops To 2017 Levels According to a new report from CryptoQuant, however, the underlying picture is more complex than the price chart suggests. Despite the short-term decline, XRP whales are becoming increasingly active, showing no hesitation in trading and accumulating even as retail participation weakens. This divergence between whale behavior and market sentiment is noteworthy. Historically, XRP’s most significant recoveries have begun during phases of deep pessimism, when large holders quietly build exposure rather than chase rallies. The latest data confirms this pattern: while price approaches yearly lows, whale-driven transaction volume has risen, signaling that high-value wallets are repositioning rather than exiting. Whale Accumulation and CVD Shift Signal a Potential XRP Bottom The CryptoQuant report highlights that the recent surge in whale activity follows a pattern often observed during market bottoming phases. Large holders rarely accumulate aggressively during strong uptrends; instead, they tend to build positions quietly during periods of weakness, when sentiment is poor, and prices are depressed. Their willingness to buy in the current environment—while XRP trades near yearly lows—suggests strategic positioning rather than speculative momentum chasing. This behavior is typically interpreted as a pre-rally signal. When whales accumulate into weakness, it indicates confidence that current prices offer value and that the downside may be limited. Historically, such phases have preceded meaningful upside moves in XRP, as whale accumulation often absorbs available sell pressure and stabilizes market structure. Supporting this view, the report also points to a notable shift in the XRP Spot Taker CVD, which has turned taker-buy dominant. This means that aggressive buyers are now driving more of the executed volume, reflecting strengthening demand in real time. A taker-buy dominant CVD often emerges before sustained rallies, as it highlights increasing willingness among market participants to buy at the ask rather than wait for dips. Together, rising whale accumulation and a bullish CVD trend paint an increasingly constructive backdrop for XRP’s medium-term outlook. Related Reading: This Whale Isn’t Stopping: $392M Ethereum Long And A Tight Liquidation Price Revealed Price Analysis: Testing Yearly Lows as Structure Weakens XRP continues to trade near its yearly lows, with the chart showing a clear deterioration in trend structure. Price remains pinned below all major moving averages—the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day—indicating that bullish momentum has not yet returned. The persistent rejection at the 50-day moving average throughout November and December highlights the strength of overhead resistance and the absence of sustained buying pressure from the broader market. The $2.00 region, now acting as a key horizontal support, has been tested multiple times over the past month. Each retest shows reduced volatility, suggesting that sellers are no longer driving aggressive breakdown attempts. But demand remains too weak to generate a meaningful rebound. A decisive loss of this level could open the door toward the $1.80–$1.90 support zone. XRP previously consolidated during the early stages of the 2025 rally. Related Reading: Why Ethereum’s Rally Isn’t Overheated – And Where Demand Must Grow Next Volume also confirms the broader downtrend. Selling spikes stand out noticeably, whereas buy-side volume remains muted. This imbalance reinforces the prevailing bearish structure, even as whale accumulation begins to appear on-chain. For XRP to shift out of this downtrend, bulls must reclaim the 50-day moving average and produce higher lows. Until then, the chart signals continued caution. Whale activity must begin translating into visible spot demand, or the risk skews to the downside. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, has broadened support for USD1, the stablecoin tied to World Liberty Financial and US President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures, reports disclosed. The exchange added new spot pairs including ETH/USD1, SOL/USD1 and BNB/USD1, and enabled fee-free swaps between USD1 and other major stablecoins. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher Binance Will Shift Collateral Into USD1 The exchange will convert all collateral backing its Binance-Peg BUSD (B-Token) into USD1 at a 1:1 ratio, a process the company said should be completed within one week. This change means USD1 is being folded into its internal collateral and liquidity systems rather than remaining only a tradable token. Market Reaction And Liquidity Effects Traders reacted quickly. Price moves in BNB and other tokens showed more buying interest after the announcement. Market data snapshots suggested a short-term uptick in BNB as liquidity and trading routes were expanded by the new USD1 pairs. Reports put the token’s wider market use and the platform’s zero-fee swaps as the likely drivers.

The stablecoin has grown quickly and is now listed among the larger stablecoins by market cap, with figures around $2.7 billion cited in recent summaries. Reports have also linked USD1 to a major Abu Dhabi investment that used the token for a $2 billion deal. Political Context And Scrutiny These commercial moves come after a politically charged episode: Trump granted a pardon earlier this year to Binance’s former CEO, an action that critics say raises questions about ties between Binance and the Trump family’s crypto interests. That sequence of events has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers and commentators, who are asking for more transparency around the deals and any possible conflicts of interest.

    "body": "As Pakistan continues to deepen its involvement in the digital asset landscape, the country has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with crypto exchange Binance, aiming to explore the tokenization of up to $2 billion in sovereign bonds, treasury bills, and commodity reserves to enhance liquidity and attract foreign investors. $2 Billion Asset Tokenization Initiative According to Reuters, the agreement sets the stage for a potential collaboration focused on allowing the tokenization and blockchain-based distribution of various real-world assets (RWAs) held by the Pakistani government. These assets may include sovereign bonds, treasury bills, and a range of commodity reserves such as oil, gas, metals, and other raw materials. Related Reading: Crypto Market Dips: The Reasons Behind Bitcoin Plunge Below $90,000 Despite FOMC Optimism The country’s finance ministry, Muhammad Aurangzeb, indicated that while the initiative could involve assets valued at up to $2 billion, final approval is still pending. The goal is to improve liquidity, transparency, and access to international markets for these assets. Aurangzeb remarked that the memorandum of understanding signifies Pakistan’s commitment to a reform-oriented economic trajectory and establishes a long-term partnership with Binance. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao expressed optimism about the agreement, calling it “a great signal for the global blockchain industry and for Pakistan.” He suggested that this partnership marks the beginning of a significant shift toward fully implementing the tokenisation initiative. PVARA Provides Initial Clearance For Binance And HTX In addition to this MoU, Pakistan has granted initial clearance for Binance and cryptocurrency exchange HTX, to register with local regulators as part of their efforts to establish domestic subsidiaries. This step allows both companies to prepare applications for full exchange licenses. The Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) provided these early approvals after assessing the governance and compliance frameworks of both platforms. Chairman Bilal bin Saqib indicated that these clearances initiate Pakistan’s phased licensing process, emphasizing that the strength of compliance will play a crucial role in determining which exchanges will proceed. This move comes as Pakistan accelerates its digital finance overhaul, which has included the formation of the Pakistan Crypto Council and the establishment of the PVARA, alongside the drafting of a formal licensing regime. Related Reading: Report Reveals 65% Of Bitcoin Treasury Companies Struggling With Major Unrealized Losses As Bitcoinist reported at the time, Pakistan’s growing involvement in digital assets drew the attention of industry leaders such as Michael Saylor, co-founder of the Bitcoin proxy firm Strategy, who praised the country’s efforts and described it as a sign that the country understands how to handle this new market. Notably, Pakistan ranks as the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency market by retail activity, according to Saqib. The government is also planning a pilot program for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and a comprehensive Virtual Assets Act. At the time of writing, the exchange’s native cryptocurrency, Binance Coin (BNB), is trading at $878, down 35% from all-time highs just above $1,369.

    "body": "According to a report from CNBC, Coinbase (COIN), the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, is preparing to launch its own prediction market in collaboration with Kalshi, one of the largest federally regulated financial exchanges in the country. Coinbase Teases Major Updates The anticipation surrounding the prediction market has been building for nearly a month. Recently, a screenshot of what appears to be Coinbase’s prediction markets dashboard was shared by Silicon Valley researcher Jane Manchun Wong in a post on social media site X (previously Twitter), shedding some light on the features of the forthcoming product. Related Reading: Crypto Market Dips: The Reasons Behind Bitcoin Plunge Below $90,000 Despite FOMC Optimism The Information first indicated on November 19 that Coinbase planned to introduce these prediction markets powered by Kalshi, with a formal unveiling set for the “Coinbase System Update” event scheduled for December 17. Formal announcements regarding this new platform are expected soon, potentially as early as next week. Bloomberg corroborated this report, stating that the cryptocurrency exchange is also likely to announce a tokenized stock offering during the same event, in line with Tether’s same vision reported earlier this week. While Coinbase has refrained from confirming these developments directly to CNBC, the company has encouraged stakeholders to tune in to its upcoming event for more details. The firm did not disclose a specific timeline for when the prediction markets will become available to users. ‘Everything Exchange’ Status Coinbase’s push to launch a prediction market is part of a broader strategy to transform itself into an “everything exchange”—a comprehensive platform for trading a wide variety of assets, including cryptocurrencies, tokenized stocks, and event contracts. CEO Brian Armstrong articulated this vision earlier in May, stressing that the cryptocurrency exchange aims to evolve into a leading financial services application within the next decade. This development comes as Coinbase faces increasing competition from rivals like Robinhood (HOOD), Gemini (GEMI), and Kraken, all of whom have introduced tokenized equity offerings for users outside the US and are exploring prediction markets to varying extents.

These include major deals such as the purchase of the crypto derivatives exchange Deribit and the on-chain advertising firm Spindl, as well as seven other major acquisitions. This also follows a shift in investor sentiment in the digital asset space, with the largest cryptocurrencies — including Bitcoin (BTC) — having retraced by over 30% since October amid fears of a new bear market beginning. Over the past months, the exchange’s stock, which trades under the ticker name COIN, has also seen a significant drop of over 39%, with the current valuation standing at $267 per share.

    "title": "Solana’s Long-Awaited Firedancer Launch Sparks 5% Rally",
    "body": "Solana’s network took a notable step this week as Firedancer, a validator client developed by Jump Crypto, began running on the mainnet, and markets reacted quickly. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher According to Solana’s announcement, the client moved out of a controlled testing phase and is now active for real-world validation. Traders pushed SOL up about 5%, with the token trading close to $140 during the initial move. Firedancer Goes Live On Mainnet During more than 100 days of controlled tests, a small set of validators produced more than 50,000 blocks without downtime, according to reports. Built in C and C++, Firedancer was made to handle heavy workloads and to lower the chance of network interruptions. Test environments reportedly showed the client processing over 1 million transactions per second, a figure that far exceeds current mainnet throughput. BREAKING: After 3 years of development, Firedancer is now live on Solana Mainnet, and has been running on a handful of validators for 100 days, successfully producing 50,000 blocks 🔥💃 pic.twitter.com/Y0WxxEj2WL — Solana (@solana) December 12, 2025 That high number comes from lab-style tests, not live traffic, and should be read as experimental performance rather than everyday capability. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko marked the transition as a step out of a long beta cycle for the network. Early Adoption And Stake Adoption is still small in terms of stake. The first Firedancer nodes hold under one percent of total staked SOL, and that share is expected to grow as operators add it to their setups. Reports have disclosed that a December rollout prompted more than 20% of validators to move from earlier experimental clients, showing a rapid shift among some operators. Running multiple validator clients reduces dependence on a single software implementation. If one client encounters a bug, others can keep block production running. That diversity mirrors how other large proof-of-stake chains operate. Why This Matters For Validators And Apps Validators and developers stand to benefit if Firedancer keeps meeting its goals. Faster or more reliable validation could mean more capacity for apps that need many transactions per second. For node operators, the option to mix clients offers an added safety net. Still, the network’s real-world load will be the true test, and watchers say they will be looking at uptime and performance over the coming weeks.

    "title": "XRP Price To Reach $27: The Technical Formation That Paints 1,300% Surge",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has again predicted that the XRP price could reach $27. This time around, he outlined the technical formation that could spark a parabolic surge for the altcoin as it eyes the $27 target. How The XRP Price Could Reach $27 In an X post, Egrag Crypto stated that the Linear Regression targets for the XRP price are $3.4, $10, and $27. He further explained that, as of this month, these three major price levels stand out based on the long-term Logarithmic Linear Regression Channel. The analyst then touched on each price target and how XRP could reach there. Related Reading: XRP Price Needs To Hold This Macro Support For Hope Of Revival Egrag Crypto described the $3.40 target for the XRP price as the mean reversion. He stated that a retest and rejection from $3.40 would be one of the strongest bearish TA signals for the altcoin. The analyst further remarked that this target is based solely on chart structure, not fundamentals. He added that a close above this level means that XRP is officially back in macro bullish territory. Furthermore, the analyst stated that the $10 target for the XRP price is the upper midline. He explained that this is where full bull expansion normally accelerates and that the target rises with time because this channel is logarithmic. Lastly, Egrag Crypto highlighted $27 as the top of the channel. He noted that multiple long-term confluences point to this target for the altcoin. Notably, this XRP price prediction comes amid several bullish fundamentals for the altcoin. Ripple was just granted a conditional approval for its national trust bank charter, which could boost XRP’s adoption. XRP also just expanded to Solana with Hex Trust’s launch of its wrapped XRP token for DeFi purposes. Meanwhile, Swiss bank AMINA Bank has integrated Ripple payments, which utilize XRP. The Major Levels To Watch Haven’t Changed Crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that the major levels for the XRP price haven’t changed. The macro supports are $2.03 and $1.64. On the other hand, the macro resistance is $2.41, which a break above would confirm a bullish scenario for the altcoin. The analyst remarked that if a break above $2.41 happens, the next measured targets stand around $2.75 and $2.90.

She reiterated that there is no official confirmation yet on the next potential move for XRP. Interestingly, the world’s largest IQ holder, YoungHoon Kim, stated that XRP has a strong possibility of reaching a new ATH by the end of this year. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.01, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Bearish Signals Are ‘Hard To Ignore’: Analyst Warns Of Drop To April Lows",
    "body": "As Bitcoin (BTC) tries to hold the $90,000 barrier, some analysts affirm that the flagship crypto’s bear market signals are becoming clearer, suggesting that a breakdown to new lows could be around the corner. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds Bitcoin Bear Flag Raises Concerns On Friday, Bitcoin shredded its Thursday gains, dropping 3.2% intraday to retest the $89,500-$90,500 support zone once again. The cryptocurrency has been trading between the $84,500-$94,500 range for the past four weeks, briefly falling to a seven-month low of $80,600 during the late November correction. This week, the flagship crypto’s price has seen more volatility, fueled by the expectations of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut and positive regulatory developments in the US. However, BTC has failed to successfully break and hold above its local range’s upper boundary after multiple retests, ultimately falling to the mid-zone of its range. Analyst Ted Pillows highlighted a concerning pattern on Bitcoin’s chart, warning that the cryptocurrency risks a drop to new multi-month lows if the price fails to hold key support levels. Per the post, BTC has been forming a bear flag for nearly a month, which “is too hard to ignore” after the price continues to be rejected from the formation’s upper boundary. The analyst affirmed that this pattern follows a trend that has been developing over the past two months. As he pointed out, bearish flags have been continuously forming on BTC’s chart since the October 10 market pullback, with each pattern resolving in a breakdown to lower levels. To Ted, the new formation signals “that the overall trend is still to the downside.” He suggested that a close above the $96,000 level would invalidate the bearish pattern. On the contrary, a drop to below the $86,000 support, where the formation’s lower boundary is located, could push Bitcoin to the April lows, around the $76,000 mark. Is The 2022 Playbook Repeating? The market observer also noted a resemblance between the last cycle and the current one, which could lead to a drop below the $70,000 level. The chart shows that after losing the 50-Week EMA indications, Bitcoin consolidated within a bear flag before breaking down and descending to the 2022 lows. Now, BTC displays a similar performance after losing the 50-Week EMA and breaking down from its October bear flag. “If this plays out, a pump to $100,000 and then a dump below $70,000” would follow, the analyst added. Meanwhile, Robert Mercer shared a similar perspective in a series of X posts. The analyst affirmed that the classic four-year cycle has not changed despite the significant increase in institutional adoption: Bitcoin is breaking crucial supports one by one and entering a bear market. The same happened back in the end of 2021. At the moment, BTC is forming an ascending channel with the top near $100,000 – $104,000, you can see a clear Right Shoulder of H&S in this move. Something similar happened in the beginning of 2022. He also asserted that Bitcoin shows a similar picture “from the 1W MA50 perspective,” as BTC has traded below this indicator for multiple weeks now for the first time in the bullish cycle.

As of this writing, BTC Trades at $89,990, a 2.75% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",
