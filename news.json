    "title": "Why Is Bitcoin Lagging Gold And Silver? Anthony Pompliano Explains",
    "body": "Gold and silver have gone on a record-setting tear in recent months, ripping through fresh all-time highs, while Bitcoin has been stuck grinding sideways in a tight $84,000–$94,000 box since mid-November. In a January 27 video posted to X, Anthony Pompliano argued the gap is less about a single catalyst and more about shifting demand drivers, market structure, and a new fight for attention and risk capital. Pompliano framed the disconnect with blunt scorekeeping. “We have gold, which is up 80% in the last year. Silver’s up 250%, copper’s up 40%, and platinum’s up nearly 200% over the last 12 months,” he said, before turning to the contrast: “At the same exact time, Bitcoin is down 16% over the last year.” In his telling, the metals aren’t moving as a monolith, they’re responding to different sources of demand. Gold, he said, is benefiting from central banks accumulating reserves and what he described as “a definitization of the global economy,” where flows rotate out of dollars not into other fiat, but into gold. Silver, by contrast, is less about store-of-value positioning and more about industrial pull. Pompliano pointed to defense equipment, AI hardware, and self-driving cars as examples of end-demand, arguing that “the world is building things again” and that re-industrialization makes silver a direct beneficiary. Related Reading: Expert Who Nailed The Bitcoin Top Now Says Buy At These Levels Copper and platinum, in his framework, are even cleaner industrial stories. Copper rides electrification (EVs, grid buildouts, renewables) and “significant industrial demand.” Platinum’s move, he argued, is supply constrained, describing “very, very low supply” that creates a market structure favorable to holders. Pompliano also highlighted what he called a rotation within metals where gold led, then silver, and more recently copper and platinum, a sequence he dubbed “the metals mania.” So Why Hasn’t Bitcoin Joined The Run? Pompliano’s first answer was structural: Wall Street’s adoption is changing who holds Bitcoin and how it trades. He described an “IPO moment of Bitcoin,” (referring to Jordy Visser’s theory), where long-term holders have been handing coins off to institutional players. In Pompliano’s view, some early holders owned Bitcoin precisely because it was “outside the system,” and the asset’s migration into mainstream finance may reduce enthusiasm from that cohort. He also pointed to public comments from Peter Thiel and others suggesting Bitcoin’s future may be less “asymmetric” than its early years. The second structural shift is the proliferation of financial instruments around BTC. “It used to be really hard to short Bitcoin. Well, now you can do it very simply,” Pompliano said, arguing that options and shorting change the market’s plumbing and dampen volatility. “Bitcoin used to be an 80 vol asset. Now it’s more like a 40 vol asset,” he added, positioning the trade-off as fewer parabolic upside phases but also fewer catastrophic drawdowns. From there, Pompliano moved to narrative demand — specifically, the idea that Bitcoin had been treated as a “chaos hedge.” He argued that recent perceptions of rising geopolitical stability have reduced the perceived need for that insurance bid, while central banks, with far larger pools of capital, continue to express their hedge preference through gold. “It seems like there is not as much of a bid for Bitcoin coming as this insurance hedge,” he said, stressing he viewed it as a flow and narrative issue rather than a loss of utility. Related Reading: Global Liquidity Says Bitcoin Is Extremely Undervalued – Here’s The ‘Real’ Figure He made a similar point about inflation hedging, claiming disinflation has undercut one of Bitcoin’s most effective recent narratives. Citing Trueflation, Pompliano said the metric showed 1.2% inflation, “150 basis points lower than it was just 90 days ago,” and argued that AI and tariffs are deflationary forces. If investors don’t expect inflation to run hot, he reasoned, some capital simply won’t reach BTC. Finally, he argued Bitcoin is losing mindshare and speculative oxygen to AI and to a broader set of “risk-taking” outlets. “There is simply more competition,” Pompliano said, extending the idea beyond markets into an attention economy where every asset competes when users open a financial app and decide where to allocate leftover cash. In that framing, Bitcoin is no longer the default high-upside wager for younger participants; it’s competing with AI equities, prediction markets, and sports betting. Why is bitcoin lagging while gold, silver, copper, and platinum continue to go higher? I break down the forces driving the metals rally, how Wall Street adoption has reshaped Bitcoin’s market structure, and why inflation expectations, global stability, and AI are influencing… pic.twitter.com/VzATl6ZCYi — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) January 27, 2026 Pompliano’s closing message was that laggards can catch up and that he sees Bitcoin as “more interesting sitting at $87,000 than it was at $126,000.” But he also cautioned that a lower-volatility, more institutional Bitcoin may demand a different temperament from holders. “If you actually get impatient, you’re going to be disappointed. You’re going to get shaken out,” he said, arguing that the trade increasingly resembles a waiting game rather than a yearly sprint. At press time, BTC traded at $88,131.

    "title": "What Davos Revealed About BlackRock, Ripple And XRP: Pundits Weigh In",
    "body": "A panel of XRP-focused commentators is leaning heavily into Davos optics as evidence that BlackRock and Ripple are converging on a shared vision for tokenized finance, even as none of the participants produced direct confirmation of a formal partnership between the two firms. BlackRock, Ripple And XRP After Davos Host Versan Aljarrah opened by pointing to “BlackRock and Brad Garlinghouse at Davos,” asking guest Jake Claver what he took from their presence and the “conclusion they had over there.” Claver’s answer centered on what he said he heard from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink about settlement consolidation. “He mentioned that it would be ideal if everything was on one blockchain or at least settled back to one blockchain,” Claver said. “For Ripple to be in the room and having been in the room for years at this point, it gives me you know a lot of confidence that it is the XRPL I feel like BlackRock and Ripple are much more involved than people realize.” Today we’re joined by @beyond_broke to discuss BlackRock’s quiet ties with Ripple, the soft disclosures around XRP, and the future of digitization and tokenization. Excited to have everyone back together for this one.https://t.co/oMHGWqMehB pic.twitter.com/u1s7LyOAhs — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) January 26, 2026 Aljarrah immediately widened the claim beyond Davos stagecraft, asserting, “it’s quite obvious at this point that Blackrock, JP Morgan, Ripple and all these major banks they have some ties to Ripple [and] XRP,” before returning to the recurring theme that Davos access itself is a filter. Later, he argued that the set of crypto-native executives allowed near institutions like the WEF and BIS was narrowing and that Garlinghouse’s inclusion mattered more than “headline hype.” Related Reading: ‘I’m Very Bullish’: Ripple CEO Forecasts Record Performance For Crypto In 2026 David (Digital Outlook) pushed the discussion toward implementation, but repeatedly brought BlackRock back into the frame as a connective thread in Ripple’s institutional strategy. “When it came out to like, okay, has Ripple really positioned themselves to be like […] the main leader in the space […] with the acquisitions that they’ve made […] custody with Palisade,” he said. “I think they got Metaco and Standard Custody in there […] clearance through Hidden Road, all that. Then […] you see all these other linkages between their partners like what they’re doing with Blackrock. You know, they’ve got some stuff going on there.” A second line of argument was that BlackRock’s eventual entry could be the trigger for an XRP liquidity event. Edo Farina framed it in “order size” terms: “It takes one huge institutional order from a Blackrock a great scale and that’s it,” he said, claiming market pricing can stay muted if institutional positioning happens through OTC arrangements. Related Reading: Ripple Builds XRP ‘Wall Street Kit’: Developer Claims ‘Billions Incoming’ Claver added: “When Blackrock steps in, there will be likely a supply shock that allows XRP to decouple from the rest of the crypto market and Bitcoin,” and tied that idea to a viral episode the panel said briefly moved XRP out of sync with the rest of crypto. “We’ve seen it decoupled once […] when […] the [fake] trust that had been filed in Delaware for Blackrock’s iShares XRP ETF […] hit Twitter,” Claver said. Still, BlackRock’s observable crypto footprint still tilts towards Ethereum and Bitcoin rather than XRP. BlackRock’s flagship US spot exposure is via products tracking bitcoin and ether, IBIT and ETHA, while its tokenization beachhead has also been Ethereum-first: BlackRock’s BUIDL fund debuted on Ethereum via Securitize in March 2024, and only later expanded to additional networks. Also, BlackRock’s own 2026 thematic outlook is explicitly naming Ethereum as the infrastructure layer that “collects the toll” as tokenization scales, with stablecoins treated as an early proxy for tokenization “in action.” BlackRock highlights data indicating “65%+” of tokenized assets sit on Ethereum, an argument for why “one blockchain” speculation often defaults to ETH in institutional circles. At press time, XRP traded at $1.88. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Bitcoin has reaffirmed its bearish structure after strong rejection near $98,000, signaling that sellers remain firmly in control. With key resistance holding and momentum tilting lower, traders are now shifting focus to where the price could head next if the downside continues to unfold. Neckline Rejection Locks In A Bearish Bias Crypto analyst Crypto Patel, in a recent post on X, pointed out that Bitcoin has firmly rejected the $94,000–$98,000 neckline resistance, a move that reinforces a bearish market structure. The rejection signals that sellers remain firmly in control, with the failure to reclaim this zone preventing any meaningful shift in momentum. Related Reading: Global Liquidity Says Bitcoin Is Extremely Undervalued – Here’s The ‘Real’ Figure From a technical standpoint, Patel noted that Bitcoin has confirmed a failed Head and Shoulders pattern, followed by a bear-flag breakdown. This sequence strengthens the bearish outlook, as the price action continues to respect lower highs while struggling beneath key resistance. As long as BTC remains capped below the neckline, the broader trend remains decisively bearish. Looking ahead, Patel emphasized that price action below the $90,000 level favors further downside continuation. Based on the measured move from the breakdown, Bitcoin could slide toward the $75,000–$70,000 support region, representing a potential decline of around 22% from current levels. On the flip side, Patel stressed that a bullish bias would only return if Bitcoin manages a strong reclaim and acceptance above $92,000. Until that happens, any upside attempts are likely to be short-lived, making rallies opportunities for selling rather than signs of a trend reversal. $89,000: The Fuse For A Potential Bitcoin Short Squeeze According to another Bitcoin post shared by Ardi, the $89,000 level stands out as a critical threshold for any potential shift in momentum. A decisive break above this zone could begin to trigger short-squeeze conditions, as bearish positions that entered lower start to feel pressure and cover. Related Reading: Expert Who Nailed The Bitcoin Top Now Says Buy At These Levels He further emphasized that $90,300 remains the primary gatekeeper for the market. A strong reclaim and sustained acceptance above this level would signal improving bullish control, allowing price to move higher in search of the $92,000 liquidity band, where a concentration of stops and resting orders is likely positioned. On the downside, Ardi noted that liquidity near $86,000 has already been taken, suggesting that immediate downside targets have been largely satisfied. With that sweep complete, attention now shifts to whether bulls can push through overhead resistance and force late bears to exit, setting the stage for a sharper upside reaction.

    "title": "Dogecoin Price Just Confirmed A Reversal With The RSI Divergence",
    "body": "Dogecoin’s price action on the daily timeframe is starting to show early signs that the downtrend may be losing momentum. The king of meme coins has been trading with months of declining price movement, but technical analysis shows it is now printing a technical setup that might become a turning point. A developing double-bottom structure combined with a clear RSI divergence is shifting attention back to the possibility of a reversal, even as Dogecoin’s price action is compressed near long-term support around $0.12. RSI Divergence Shows Weakening Bearish Momentum The most notable development comes from the Relative Strength Index on the daily chart. Technical analysis shows that while Dogecoin’s price is now revisiting the same support region around the $0.12 zone, the RSI failed to make a new low. Instead, it formed a higher low, which created a bullish divergence between momentum and price. Related Reading: The Macro Wave 5 Move THat Could Trigger 3,000% For Dogecoin Price This divergence shows that sellers are no longer pushing price lower with the same strength seen earlier in the downtrend. This development is notable because similar RSI behavior has often preceded relief rallies for Dogecoin when paired with strong structural support. Furthermore, Dogecoin’s price action appears to be creating a double bottom along the lower boundary of a descending channel, as shown in the chart below. This type of structure is pointing to exhaustion on the sell side behind the scenes. The longer Dogecoin’s price holds above this base, the stronger the argument becomes that accumulation is taking place. The reversal outlook is based on whether Dogecoin can reclaim and hold above $0.16. A confirmed move above it would validate the RSI divergence and double bottom, although it won’t be until Dogecoin is able to break above $0.31 that the real rally will begin. Fractal Points To An Incoming Expansion Technical analysis of Dogecoin’s higher-timeframe chart introduces a compelling historical parallel that sees the memecoin pushing well above $0.31. Particularly, Dogecoin is printing a fractal on the weekly candlestick chart that looks like one that preceded a 331% breakout in late 2024. Related Reading: Dogecoin RSI Just Entered Historical Oversold Levels Again, Will It Repeat 2021? In that prior instance, Dogecoin spent months grinding lower, formed a rounded basing structure, and then launched into a near-vertical move once momentum flipped. The current structure shows a similar rounded recovery attempt followed by a controlled pullback into long-term support. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1221. As shown in the chart below, the current price action is now sitting at the base of what could be the next vertical leg higher if the fractal continues to play out as expected. Although there is still a need for confirmation, these analyses indicate that Dogecoin may be transitioning out of its corrective phase and positioning for a much larger move ahead.

    "title": "Here’s How Much XRP Ripple Execs Have Dumped So Far",
    "body": "For over a decade, Ripple and its executives have been steadily dumping XRP into the open market. Because XRP was fully created at launch, every token sold came from a known and finite supply. By comparing the original allocations from 2012 with current on-chain holdings, it is now possible to calculate how much XRP Ripple and its executives have offloaded so far. How XRP Was Allocated And Where The Tokens Went XRP was launched in 2012 with a fixed supply of 100 billion XRP, all created at once on the XRP Ledger. There has never been mining, staking, or inflation. Of that total supply, 80 billion XRP were transferred to the company that later became Ripple, while the remaining 20 billion XRP were allocated to founders and early insiders. The core individuals involved at launch were Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. Related Reading: Coinbase Exec Points Out The Big Difference Between Bitcoin And Central Banks More than a decade later, the remaining holdings of Ripple and its executives provide a clear benchmark for calculating how much XRP has been sold. Combined, Ripple and named executives currently control about 41.485 billion XRP. Ripple itself holds approximately 37.685 billion XRP, split between 3.5 billion XRP in wallets that can be accessed directly and 34.185 billion XRP locked in escrow. Among executives, Chris Larsen, Ripple’s chairman, holds about 2.5 billion XRP across eight wallets, while Arthur Britto controls roughly 1.3 billion XRP spread across seven wallets. David Schwartz, despite being a co-founder, holds a significantly smaller amount, peaking historically at around 26 million XRP, far below the multi-billion-token balances of other insiders. When current holdings are subtracted from the original allocations, the numbers indicate that Ripple and its executives have sold or distributed approximately 58.515 billion XRP since 2012. What Those Sales Mean In Price And Market Terms The scale of these sales often raises concerns about long-term price pressure, but timing is critical. XRP’s earliest recorded market price was approximately $0.00587 in August 2013. Today, it trades near $1.88, reflecting a remarkable increase of roughly 31,756% over that period. These gains unfolded even as billions of XRP entered circulation gradually rather than in sudden waves. In 2017, Ripple implemented an escrow system that locked up 55 billion XRP, allowing up to 1 billion XRP to be released each month. Any unused portion is returned to escrow, effectively limiting unexpected supply shocks. As of 2026, 34.185 billion XRP remain locked under this system. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Forecasts 72.86% Crash To $30,000 Cumulatively, the 58.515 billion XRP sold over 13 years would be valued at approximately $109 billion at today’s prices. These sales occurred alongside ongoing ecosystem development, legal challenges, and multiple market cycles, highlighting that distribution happened in a managed, phased manner. Overall, while Ripple and its executives have distributed a significant portion of their holdings, the careful, escrow-managed approach over more than a decade coincided with sustained price appreciation. This suggests that strategic, phased selling has not undermined XRP’s long-term market growth. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Prediction Markets On BNB Chain Explode As Trading Volume Crosses $20B",
    "body": "Prediction markets on the BNB Chain have seen massive growth over the past months, with the leading platforms within the ecosystem reaching remarkable levels and their cumulative trading volume hitting a new milestone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At Risk Of 50% Correction As BTC’s 2022 Bearish Playbook Repeats BNB Chain Sees Prediction Markets Explosion On Monday, BNB Chain announced that prediction markets in the ecosystem reached a new milestone, surpassing the $20.91 billion mark in cumulative trading volume over the weekend. Notably, the BNB Chain has expanded its presence over the past few months, diversifying with key players such as Opinion Labs, Probable, Myriad Markets, Predict.Fun, and XO Markets. Prediction markets are one of the most popular ways to forecast events and manage risk at scale, the BNB Chain explained in a blog post, becoming “powerful tools for smarter decisions in finance, governance, and beyond.” “From elections and sports to AI milestones and macroeconomic shifts, prediction markets transform scattered knowledge into actionable signals. Platforms like Polymarket, which saw over $2B in volume in October 2024, prove that decentralized markets can even outperform centralized forecasters,” they added. According to Dune data, prediction markets within the ecosystem have seen a significant surge since Q4, increasing nearly 89% just in the past month. The data also shows that BNB Chain has taken the lead in weekly trading volume by chain, surpassing off-chain prediction markets, Polygon, Solana, and Base since the start of 2026. Moreover, DeFiLlama data indicate that three platforms in the BNB ecosystem are currently among the top 5 prediction markets, only behind Kalshi and Polymarket, signaling increasing adoption. Opinion Labs ranks third in the list, with its 7-day and 30-day trading volumes reaching $725.56 million and $3.35 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, its open interest exceeded $144 million as of late January. Probable has seen $558 million in volume over the past 7 days and $1.05 billion in the last 30 days. The platform has also reached a $1.4 billion in notional volume and over 17,000 users just a month after its launch. ETF Push And Price Recovery The recent milestone comes as major institutional players share interest in the BNB token. Last week, Grayscale filed an S-1 form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) based on the cryptocurrency. If approved, the Grayscale BNB Trust (GBNB) will “reflect the value of BNB held by the Trust, including BNB earned as Staking Consideration” and offer investors exposure to the token without having to hold it directly. As of this writing, BNB’s price has recovered from Sunday’s correction and is attempting to turn a key area back into support. Market observer Rose Premium Signals highlighted that the cryptocurrency bounced from the strong $860 demand zone after the sharp corrective move.

    "title": "Ethereum Just Hit A Hidden Threshold That Often Precedes Explosive Moves",
    "body": "The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum, appears to have quietly crossed an important critical threshold that has historically signaled major price expansions. While the Ethereum price action may still appear calm on the surface, underlying market structure and flow dynamics suggest a meaningful shift is underway. This type of transition typically occurs when accumulation replaces distribution, volatility compresses, and smart money positions ahead of broader market recognition. A Silent Shift That Usually Comes Before Violent Expansion Ethereum just crossed a quiet but massive threshold. Trader and investor Shuarix has mentioned on X that Zama has gone live with the first fully encrypted Initial Coin Offering (ICO) ever executed on the ETH mainnet, moving a confidential USDT and running a sealed-bid Dutch auction entirely on encrypted data. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Institutional Support, Though ETH Price Outlook Remains Contested In just 3 days, more than $118 million was committed, over $100 million was shielded, and the auction was 218% oversubscribed with more than 11,000 verified bidders. At peak activity, the Zama application became the most-used app on ETH, surpassing both USDT and Uniswap during the event, with zero downtime and full ETH-level throughout. Crypto analyst Milk Road revealed that BitMine Immersion Technologies has made a large purchase of 40,302 ETH in a single move, which brings their total stack holdings to a massive 4,243,338 ETH, worth over $12.3 billion at the current price. In perspective, the company now controls 3.52% of the entire ETH circulating supply, and they’re not just letting it sit idle. According to Milk Road, BitMine has over 2 million ETH tokens already staked, generating $180 million in annualized rewards. This means the company is not just playing the buy-and-hold game, but compounding its position at scale, which is all well and good for BitMine. Meanwhile, this sustained buying pressure will help create a price floor for the long-term ETH holders. Furthermore, this move is the type of institutional accumulation that will keep ETH moving inside its ascending channel. Thus, this will help to pull the price back into that channel after the macro shocks temporarily push it out. “Below is the 2025 tariff shock. While the headlines try to muddy your view of things, this chart will tell the real story,” Milk Road noted. Accumulation Continues Despite Price Being Near Entry Levels The realized price of the Ethereum accumulation address is acting as a major support level. A crypto investor known as CW has also pointed out that ETH has only reached this realized price once in history, which is very similar to the current price range. Related Reading: Ethereum Stalls In A Critical Zone As Breakout Structures Wait For Confirmation However, the whale’s purchase price for ETH is not significantly different from the current price. Despite that, their ETH accumulation is increasing, indicating that whales still view the current price as fair value. This shows that they are preparing for an upward trend.

    "title": "5 Months In Red: What Happens If Ethereum Price Closes January With A Loss?",
    "body": "The Ethereum price has struggled to regain momentum amid a persistent downtrend. After closing the last four months in the red, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is showing no signs of relief in January 2026. On-chain data shows that Ethereum’s current trajectory mirrors past cycle downturns, raising the possibility of further price declines and prolonged bearish sentiment. Ethereum Price Nears Fifth Consecutive Month Of Losses Ethereum has been in a prolonged slump, marking its fourth straight month of losses in 2025. As the market navigates the final week of January, the cryptocurrency is poised to potentially close a fifth consecutive month in the red, a streak that would reinforce the ongoing bearish trend. Related Reading: Analyst Says You’re Not Bullish Enough On Ethereum – What Does He Mean? On-chain data from CryptoRank shows that throughout 2025, Ethereum saw more red months than green ones. The cryptocurrency began the year with four consecutive months of decline from January to April, followed by a brief recovery in May, only to fall again in June. After this, ETH posted two months of gains, finishing July and August in the green. However, this recovery was short-lived, and since then, the cryptocurrency has been in a downtrend. During its most recent four-month decline, CryptoRanks reported that Ethereum closed September down by 5.59%. The downtrend accelerated at the end of November, with the cryptocurrency crashing by 22.2%, more than four times the decline of the previous monthly close. December 2025 saw another month in the red, though the drop was much smaller, at just 0.83%. Now, in January 2026, Ethereum is still in a downtrend. On-chain data indicates the cryptocurrency has already fallen 1.78% this month, and shows no sure signs of a bullish reversal. Moreover, at the time of writing, ETH is trading above $2,900, reflecting a roughly 5.95% decline over the past week. What A Red January Could Mean For ETH The last time Ethereum closed five consecutive months in the red was in 2018. That year, Ethereum significantly underperformed, recording gains in only 3 of 12 months. The cryptocurrency had posted continuous monthly losses, with November marking its steepest monthly decline at 42.5%. Related Reading: Ethereum Funding Rates Pushing Towards Negative: What’s Going On? After the four-month closing streak, Ethereum’s downtrend persisted for another two months before experiencing a sharp but brief recovery in December 2018. Despite this temporary rebound, the cryptocurrency closed January 2019 in the red, falling 20%. If history were to repeat itself in the current cycle, Ethereum could end January in a decline, similar to its 2018 performance. Interestingly, historical data shows that February has often been a bullish month for ETH. However, 2025 has seen declines from January through to April; it’s uncertain if Ethereum will follow past bullish patterns. For now, what is certain is that ETH’s price is down and would need a significant boost in its bullish momentum. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Crypto Funds Funneled To Money Launderers Hit $82 Billion, According To Chainalysis",
    "body": "Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis has released a new report highlighting a sharp escalation in crypto-based money laundering, warning that Chinese-language money laundering networks are emerging as one of the most serious and rapidly growing threats in the digital asset ecosystem. The Rise of Chinese‑Language Networks In Crypto Crime According to the report, illicit on‑chain money laundering activity has expanded dramatically over the past five years. In 2020, crypto-related laundering was estimated to be around $10 billion. By 2025, that figure had climbed to more than $82 billion. A key driver behind this growth has been the rapid rise of Chinese‑language money laundering networks, often referred to as CMLNs. In 2025, these networks accounted for roughly 20% of all identified illicit crypto laundering activity on‑chain. Related Reading: XRP Outlook For 2026: AI Model Signals New Record Ahead — Can Price Reach $6? Chainalysis noted that this regional concentration is further supported by off‑ramping behavior observed on the blockchain. As detailed in the report, CMLNs now routinely launder more than 10% of funds stolen through so‑called “pig butchering” scams. The pace at which these networks have grown stands out even within the broader crypto crime landscape. Since 2020, inflows to identified CMLNs have increased 7,325 times faster than those to centralized exchanges (CEXs). Growth has also outstripped other laundering channels, expanding 1,810 times faster than decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and 2,190 times faster than illicit on‑chain flows that remain within criminal ecosystems. While CMLNs are not the only actors involved in crypto laundering, Chainalysis found that Chinese‑language, Telegram‑based services now represent a disproportionately large share of attributed global laundering activity. Cross‑Border Crime At Scale The report also shows that CMLNs function openly across multiple platforms and rely on complex, multi‑layered systems. Their operations are characterized by industrial‑level processing capacity and a high degree of technical sophistication. In 2025 alone, Chainalysis identified six distinct service types that together form the CMLN ecosystem. Combined, these services processed $16.1 billion in illicit inflows during the year. The number of active entities within these networks has also grown rapidly, expanding from a small number of wallets just a few years ago to more than 1,799 active on‑chain wallets in 2025.

He noted that Chinese money laundering networks have rapidly evolved into “multi‑billion‑dollar cross‑border operations” offering efficient and competitively priced services to organized crime groups across Europe and North America. Chris Urben, Managing Director at Nardello & Co, highlighted another major shift within these networks. He explained that Chinese money laundering groups have increasingly moved away from informal value transfer systems, such as traditional underground banking methods. Instead, Urben emphasized that these criminals have embraced cryptocurrencies as a “faster and more discreet way” to move funds across borders, eliminating the need for complex manual ledgers spread across multiple jurisdictions.

    "title": "Analyst Says Chainlik Price Could Crash 50% If This Level Fails",
    "body": "Chainlink is approaching a technically sensitive area with a growing downside risk on higher timeframes that was flagged by a crypto analyst. Based on a recent technical analysis on X, the analyst noted that LINK’s current weekly structure leaves the market vulnerable if an important support zone around $10 gives way. The price action is still holding above that area for now, but the chart shows that a decisive move below it could quickly change the outlook into a bearish mood. Head And Shoulders Formation On Weekly Timeframe According to a popular crypto analyst known as CryptoBullet on X, LINK’s weekly chart has carved out a standard head and shoulders formation. Based on the rules of technical analysis, the Head and Shoulders (H&S) pattern is bearish. The pattern resolves bearish when there is a confirmed break below the neckline resistance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Forecasts 72.86% Crash To $30,000 Technical analysis of Chainlink’s price action shows the left shoulder formed during the early stages of the 2024 recovery, followed by a higher peak that marked the head in early 2025. This was then followed by another lower high that completed the right shoulder in the second half of 2025. However, the most important zone to watch is the neckline support, which slopes slightly upward and is currently sitting in the $10 to $11 region. This support zone has acted as structural support during multiple pullbacks while the head and shoulders pattern was taking shape, making it the most important level to watch going forward. As long as the price holds above it, then the pattern is unconfirmed. ChainLink Price Chart. Source: @CryptoBullet1 on X Losing Support Level And Price Targets The analyst cautioned that a decisive weekly close below the neckline would activate the bearish setup. In technical analysis, a confirmed head and shoulders breakdown is known to open the path to a measured move equal to the height of the pattern. Applied here, that projection places LINK’s downside target in the $4 to $5 range, which would represent just about a 50% decline from current price levels. CryptoBullet described this outcome as the lowest area LINK could reach this year if there’s strong selling pressure, and that such a move would only come into play if support fails very quickly. Related Reading: Ripple’s Next Steps: Where XRP Stops Being Trade And Starts Being Infrastrucutre Notably, the analysis also pointed to an intermediate level that could act as a stopping point that might stop LINK from crashing to $4. A more conservative downside target is around $7.15, which is connected with the Point of Control on the Volume Range Visible Profile and overlaps with the 2022 to 2023 accumulation zone that’s shown on the chart above. At the time of writing, LINK is trading at $11.98, up by 1.1% in the past 24 hours but down by 5.4% in a seven-day timeframe. A rebound from the neckline area would shift the short-term outlook to a relief bounce. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "According to the Bitvocation 2025 Bitcoin Jobs Data report, a total of 1,801 Bitcoin-related job openings were posted last year. That number was about 6% higher than the 1,707 listings recorded in 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sharp Reversal Leaves Over $800 Million Liquidated In 1 Day Many of the new roles were not for engineers. Non-technical positions — like product managers, marketing leads, and executive support — made up roughly 74% of the openings. This points to firms trying to build stronger day-to-day operations as they grow. Hiring Hot Spots And Fast Movers Reports say the US kept its lead with around 500 listings. But Singapore recorded the fastest jump, with job postings rising by close to 160% year over year, pushing it up the rankings. Some smaller markets also stood out: a few countries in Europe and Asia showed sizable gains, while Switzerland saw a sharp drop in opportunities. Companies appear to be spreading hiring across more places, not just the usual tech hubs. Companies And Roles That Stood Out More than 150 Bitcoin-first firms advertised roles in 2025. Miner companies and payment firms were among the busiest hirers, and a handful of names filled a lot of listings. Director-level spots increased dramatically, by a factor of about 10, as teams added senior hires to manage growth. Remote work dipped. The share of fully remote jobs fell from about 53% to 45%, which suggests more roles now need some physical presence or hybrid schedules. A Tough Match For Some Jobs Reports note that specialized technical roles remain hard to fill. Finding developers with deep Bitcoin protocol knowledge and experience with Lightning remains a challenge for recruiters. At the same time, companies say they want people who understand Bitcoin’s culture and can work within a team. That mix is rare. Salaries were not always listed, but some senior positions had clear compensation bands, signaling firms are willing to pay for experience. Related Reading: Crypto’s Q4 Weakness Mirrors Pre-Rebound 2023: Analysts What This Means For Job Seekers For candidates, the market now rewards broader skill sets.

    "title": "Bitcoin Derivatives Pressure Hits 30-Day Extreme, Price Refuses To Break",
    "body": "Bitcoin is struggling to regain traction below the $88,000 level as fear and uncertainty continue to dominate market sentiment. After a volatile selloff, the price has stabilized, but confidence remains fragile, with traders closely watching whether current support can hold or if another leg lower is still ahead. The lack of a decisive rebound reflects a market caught between defensive positioning and cautious accumulation, where conviction on both sides remains limited. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Below $87K As Political Risk Spikes – Liquidations Reveal The Real Driver Analyst Axel Adler highlighted a critical divergence developing beneath the surface. According to his analysis, the Market Pressure Index dropped to 30.54, marking a new 30-day low and falling below the previous extremes recorded on January 21 and January 25. Despite this surge in derivatives-related pressure, Bitcoin’s price barely reacted, holding steady around $88.3K. That disconnect between pressure and price is unusual and signals a moment of heightened tension. Price structure reinforces how sensitive this zone has become. Bitcoin is currently trading in the lower 17% of the Donchian channel, positioning BTC just above the $86.4K support level. This area now represents a clear decision point for the market. If buyers continue absorbing supply, a base may begin to form. If support fails, the absence of downside reaction so far could quickly give way to renewed volatility. Extreme Derivatives Pressure Meets Price Stability According to CryptoQuant data, Bitcoin’s Derivatives Market Pressure Index has reached an unusually critical state. The indicator collapsed to 30.54, marking a new 30-day low and exceeding the previous downside extremes recorded on January 21 (36.95) and January 25 (35.63). The Market Pressure Index is a normalized composite that blends price action, cumulative 6-hour net taker flow, Open Interest, and volume delta, calibrated over a 365-day window to improve signal robustness and reduce noise. The most striking detail is the speed of the move. On January 27 at 07:00 UTC, the index dropped 12 points within a single hour, yet Bitcoin’s price barely reacted, moving only from $88.2K to $88.3K. This creates a rare and critical divergence: derivatives pressure reached an extreme, but price refused to break lower. Adler stresses that this behavior leaves the market at a binary crossroads. Either buyers are actively absorbing supply at current levels—suggesting early base formation—or the market is storing downside energy that could be released sharply if support fails. Together, the charts describe a tense equilibrium. Price Structure shows BTC sitting near support, in the lower 17% of the Donchian channel, with a Structure Shift of -0.57, confirming a broken bullish structure. Meanwhile, sellers are applying maximum monthly pressure and meeting resistance. This is either strong demand asserting itself or the final pause before capitulation. Related Reading: US Institutions Step Back From Ethereum: Coinbase Premium Flashes Caution Bitcoin Downtrend Pressure Persists Below Key Averages Bitcoin is trading around $87,800 on the daily chart, continuing to struggle after repeated failures to reclaim higher resistance zones. The broader structure shows a clear transition from the late-2025 uptrend into a corrective phase, with price posting lower highs and weaker rebounds since the sharp selloff in November. While BTC has managed to stabilize above the mid-$80K region, upside momentum remains limited and fragile. From a technical perspective, the moving averages define the current battlefield. Bitcoin is trading below the 50-day moving average (blue), which is now sloping downward and acting as immediate resistance near the low-$90K area. The 100-day moving average (green) sits higher and continues to trend lower, reinforcing a bearish medium-term bias and capping recovery attempts. Above both, the 200-day moving average (red) remains well overhead near the $105K–$108K range, highlighting how far the price has drifted from a fully bullish structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator Falls Back To Post-Bear Market Levels: Investors Approach A Key Decision Point Recent bounce attempts toward $92K–$96K were decisively rejected, confirming that sellers remain active on rallies. Volume has eased compared to the November capitulation, suggesting reduced urgency rather than strong demand. For bulls, holding the $86K–$88K zone is critical to prevent a deeper breakdown. A daily close back above $90K would be the first step toward stabilizing the trend. Failure to defend current levels keeps downside risk open toward the low-$80K range.

Crypto Social Volume Has Cooled Recently In a new post on X, analytics firm Santiment has talked about how the Social Volume has compared between the cryptocurrency market, Gold, and Silver recently. Related Reading: Stablecoin Market Cap Drops By $7 Billion—What It Means For Bitcoin The “Social Volume” is an indicator that tells us about the amount of discussion that a given term or topic is receiving on the major social media platforms. It does so by counting up the total number of posts/messages/threads on the platforms that contain unique mentions of the term. Retail traders outweigh all other types of investors in population, so social media discourse tends to be a reflection of their behavior. As such, a spike in Social Volume for a particular market signals retail interest in the space. Historically, crypto traders have shifted their attention between various sections like memecoins, AI, blue chips, etc. based on where hype is the greatest. The pattern has changed recently, however, as Santiment has explained, “now, retail is proving to be open to jumping sectors entirely, with social data showing how gold, silver, and even equities are getting more and more interest based on wherever the latest pumps appear.” Below is the chart for the Social Volume shared by the analytics firm that shows this trend in action. As displayed in the graph, social media users have seen their attention shift multiple times across January. In the first week, the Social Volume was muted for all markets, corresponding to a post-holidays lull. During the second week, Gold witnessed its Social Volume shoot high as its price reached new all-time highs. Bitcoin rose alongside this surge, but crypto Social Volume still didn’t budge much. In the third week, however, social media interest in digital assets saw a return as Bitcoin and other tokens retraced. This activity likely corresponded to traders trying to speculate about the bottom. Now, in the final week of January, Silver has taken the lead in social media talk, with Gold right behind it and interest in crypto at a low. The shift in retail attention has come as Silver has set new records. “Remember that when crypto retail begins FOMO’ing in, that’s generally where tops appear,” noted Santiment. This pattern was witnessed during Silver’s latest run to a new all-time high above $117, which was followed by a drop to $103 within hours as retail hype spiked on social media.

    "body": "Ethereum price started a recovery wave from the $2,800 zone. ETH is now trading near $3,000 and might aim for more gains if it clears $3,050. Ethereum managed to stay above $2,850 and started a recovery wave. The price is trading above $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $2,970 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $2,880 zone. Ethereum Price Starts Recovery Ethereum price managed to remain stable above $2,850 and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to clear the $2,900 and $2,920 resistance levels. The price cleared the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,065 swing high to the $2,784 swing low. The price even surpassed the $3,000 level. A high was formed at $3,030 and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent upward move from the $2,784 swing low to the $3,030 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,980 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $2,970 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If the bulls remain in action above $2,970, the price could attempt another increase. Immediate resistance is seen near the $3,030 level. The first key resistance is near the $3,050 level. The next major resistance is near the $3,065 level. A clear move above the $3,065 resistance might send the price toward the $3,120 resistance. An upside break above the $3,120 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,180 resistance zone or even $3,200 in the near term. Another Rejection In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,050 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,970 level. The first major support sits near the $2,950 zone. A clear move below the $2,950 support might push the price toward the $2,880 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,825 region. The main support could be $2,780. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

    "title": "XRP Derivatives Reset: Open Interest Drops Nearly 60% From July Peak",
    "body": "XRP is trading below the $2.00 mark as the market drifts into a phase defined by apathy and uncertainty, with participation thinning and conviction on both sides fading. After a powerful rally earlier in the cycle, price action has cooled significantly, and recent attempts to regain momentum have failed to attract sustained follow-through. The current environment reflects a market that is no longer driven by aggressive speculation but instead is weighed down by caution and a lack of clear directional catalysts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Below $87K As Political Risk Spikes – Liquidations Reveal The Real Driver Top analyst Darkfost explains that the shift began in the derivatives market. After XRP open interest on Binance surged to a new all-time high of $1.76 billion on July 17, positioning became increasingly crowded. As price stalled and volatility picked up, that leverage started to unwind. The result was a sharp contraction in open interest, which unfolded alongside a major price correction. XRP fell from $3.55 to $1.83, a drawdown of nearly 50%, highlighting how tightly price and leverage were linked during the distribution phase. Declining moving averages compress the price, signaling persistent downside pressure and weak momentum. Most recently, Binance XRP open interest dropped below $500 million, a level that has persisted since the exceptional liquidation event on October 10. This sustained compression signals a market that has largely flushed excess leverage, but has yet to see renewed speculative interest—leaving XRP stuck below $2 and searching for a new equilibrium. Deleveraging Resets Market Structure After Liquidity Flush Overall, XRP open interest has fallen by nearly 60%, signaling a significant destruction of liquidity in the derivatives market, particularly following the October 10 (10/10) liquidation event. This contraction reflects a broad unwinding of leveraged positions rather than a sudden collapse in spot demand. As positions were forced out or closed voluntarily, the derivatives layer thinned substantially, leaving the market far less crowded than during the mid-2025 peak. It is also important to recognize the mechanical effect of price on open interest. As XRP’s price dropped, the notional value of outstanding futures contracts fell alongside it, naturally amplifying the contraction in OI. In other words, part of the drop reflects lower prices reducing leverage in dollar terms, not just traders exiting positions. Still, the scale of the decline points to a genuine reset in speculative activity. Stepping back, these deleveraging phases play a critical role in restoring healthier market conditions. They flush out excess leverage, reduce forced-selling risk, and shift control away from overextended short-term traders. Historically, such phases become visible when XRP open interest on Binance falls below its semi-annual average, as is the case now. Past cycles show that once leverage is rebuilt gradually—and participation returns without excessive crowding—price action often stabilizes first and recovers later. While this does not guarantee an immediate rally, the current cleanup phase reduces downside fragility and lays the groundwork for a more sustainable move if demand re-emerges. Related Reading: US Institutions Step Back From Ethereum: Coinbase Premium Flashes Caution XRP Price Action Details XRP is trading just below the $2.00 psychological level, hovering around $1.89. This is a zone that has repeatedly acted as short-term support over recent months. Declining moving averages compress the price, signaling persistent downside pressure and weak momentum. The 50-period moving average (blue) continues to slope downward and now acts as dynamic resistance near the $2.30–$2.40 region. Above it, the 100-period moving average (green) reinforces this resistance cluster, confirming that medium-term trend control remains with sellers. More importantly, XRP is now leaning on the 200-period moving average (red), which has flattened and is acting as a critical structural support around the $1.85–$1.90 range. Historically, sustained trading near the 200 MA often marks transition zones between continuation and broader trend failure. A clean break below this level would expose risk toward prior demand zones near $1.60–$1.70. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Bear Mode For 83 Days: Trend Pulse Confirms Structural Weakness Volume remains muted, suggesting market apathy rather than panic selling. This aligns with the broader derivatives deleveraging we’ve already observed, suggesting that the market has largely flushed out speculative pressure. For any meaningful recovery, XRP must reclaim the 50 MA and hold above $2.00. Until then, price action points to consolidation under resistance. The direction hinges on whether long-term support continues to hold or finally gives way. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Reports note that Bitcoin holders realized large losses as prices slid, and the headline number is hard to ignore. According to on-chain tracker CryptoQuant, about $4.5 billion in net losses was recorded on January 23. Related Reading: Bitcoin Influencers Get Spotlight In X’s New ‘Starterpacks’ That number reflects moved coins sold at prices lower than when they were bought. It is a big transfer of paper pain into real losses. Realized Losses Spike While the dollar figure grabs attention, the meaning is what matters. Many who bought late in the run higher are choosing to sell rather than hold through more decline. That behavior shows frustration. Reports say the Net Realized Profit and Loss metric tallies this by comparing sell prices to purchase prices, and a negative reading this large signals a wave of capitulation. Some larger, long-term holders have been quieter. Their activity appears muted while smaller and mid-term participants make the day-to-day moves. According to analyst posts on CryptoQuant, this mix — quiet big holders and active smaller sellers — is common during corrective stretches. It does not automatically mean the market is broken; it means sentiment has shifted toward caution. $4.5 Billion in Realized Loss on Bitcoin “Highest amount of realized losses in three years. The last time this occurred in Bitcoin, the price was trading at $28,000 after a brief correction period that lasted about a year.” – By @gaah_im pic.twitter.com/OJ7bbL3RSC — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 26, 2026 Bitcoin Price Action Midway through the week, Bitcoin traded around the mid-$80,000s, well below the $90,000 mark that some investors had eyed as a key level. Market chatter shows traders watching macro cues like the US Federal Reserve and inflation data for guidance. Volatility has not disappeared; it has simply become more tied to broader economic signals than to isolated crypto headlines. Whale addresses appeared to step in at times, helping to hold local price floors. But many traders remain cautious. Reports note that geopolitical headlines can cause quick swings, yet the current movement looks more like slow digestion of profit and repositioning than explosive panic selling. Activity on spot exchanges and ETF flows has been variable, reflecting the mixed mood across the market. Related Reading: XRP Showing Strength, Analyst Points To $4 Potential Capitulation Has Come Before Similar loss spikes were seen in March 2023, when realized losses reached close to $6 billion, and in November 2022, when losses hit roughly $4.3 billion. These events were followed by consolidation and then eventual recovery. Based on reports from analytics firms and market observers, spikes in realized losses can mark the late stages of selling pressure, after which the market sometimes finds a base.

    "body": "Solana started a recovery wave above the $125 zone. SOL price is now consolidating and faces hurdles near the $128 zone. SOL price started a decent recovery wave above $122 and $125 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $125 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $124 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could continue to move up if it clears $128 and $130. Solana Price Faces Resistance Solana price remained stable and started a decent recovery wave from $118, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL was able to climb above the $122 level. There was a move above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $132 swing high to the $117 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $124 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The bulls even pushed the price above $125. However, the bears remained active near $128. Solana is now trading above $125 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $128 level, and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $132 swing high to the $117 low. The next major resistance is near the $130 level. The main resistance could be $135. A successful close above the $135 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $142. Any more gains might send the price toward the $145 level. Another Decline In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $128 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $124.50 zone. The first major support is near the $122 level. A break below the $122 level might send the price toward the $117 support zone. If there is a close below the $117 support, the price could decline toward the $105 zone in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $125 and $122. Major Resistance Levels – $128 and $130.",

    "body": "The Bitcoin price is under increasing pressure ahead of Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which has historically corresponded with big price movements in the market’s largest cryptocurrency. Rate Cut Odds Fade The Federal Reserve (Fed) is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged at this meeting. Economists surveyed by financial data provider FactSet anticipate the federal funds rate — the benchmark rate banks use for overnight lending — will remain in the 3.5% to 3.75% range. Such a pause would follow three consecutive rate cuts delivered by the Fed toward the end of last year, a shift that initially fueled optimism across risk assets, including the Bitcoin price. Related Reading: XRP Outlook For 2026: AI Model Signals New Record Ahead — Can Price Reach $6? Despite that earlier momentum, the Bitcoin price has struggled to maintain its footing. Ahead of the FOMC decision, the cryptocurrency is trading near $87,780, roughly 30% below the all‑time highs reached last year. Market analyst Ali Martinez has pointed to Bitcoin’s historical behavior around FOMC meetings as a reason for caution. In a recent post on X (previously Twitter) Martinez highlighted that expectations for a January rate cut are extremely low, estimated at just 2.8%, signaling that meaningful policy easing is unlikely in the near term. That backdrop, he argues, has often set the stage for increased volatility for the Bitcoin price rather than sustained upside. Looking back at 2025, Martinez noted that Bitcoin reacted negatively after the vast majority of the Fed’s policy meetings. Of the eight FOMC decisions held during the year, seven were followed by notable declines for the Bitcoin price. The January meeting was followed by a 27% drop, March saw a 14% decline, June was down 8%, July slipped 6%, September fell 7%, October recorded a 29% pullback, and December ended with a 9% loss. The analysts noted that the only exception seen in the year came in May, when the Bitcoin price briefly rallied about 15% after the decision. Bitcoin Price Approaches Key Decision Zone From a technical and on‑chain perspective, analyst BitBull also sees the Bitcoin price approaching a critical moment. BitBull noted on social media that the asset has entered what she describes as a key on‑chain decision zone. At current levels, the Bitcoin price is trading almost exactly at the Active Investor Mean, estimated near $87,500. This level represents the average cost basis for active buyers, placing much of that capital at breakeven. Related Reading: Tether Reveals Massive Gold Accumulation In Q4: Adds 27 Tons To Reserves BitBull explained that pressure is building on both sides of the price. Above current levels, the short‑term holder cost basis sits near $96,500, meaning many recent buyers are already underwater. As a result, any upward move toward that zone could face selling pressure as traders look to exit at reduced losses. On the downside, the True Market Mean at around $80,700 has historically marked the boundary between a “routine correction and deeper structural weakness.” Further below, the realized price near $56,000 suggests that long‑term holders remain firmly in profit and largely unshaken by recent volatility. BitBull argues if the Bitcoin price can maintain support above the $87,500 level, it would indicate that active capital is defending its position and that broader market strength remains intact. A sustained break below that level, however, could open the door for a move toward $80,700. Featured image from OpenArt, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "PayPal Survey: 4 In 10 US Merchants Now Accept Crypto",
    "body": "A rising share of shops in the US are now taking crypto at checkout. That shift is small in some places and big in others, but it is real. Reports say that roughly four in 10 US merchants accept cryptocurrency today, and customer interest is a clear reason why. Related Reading: Record Pain: Bitcoin Investors Suffer $4.5B Loss, Most In 3 Years Merchant Demand Is Rising According to a new survey from PayPal and the National Cryptocurrency Association, about 39% of merchants have added crypto as a payment option. Many of those firms say they hear from buyers about crypto use on a regular basis. Reports note that 88% of merchants have gotten questions about paying with crypto, and 69% say they see demand at least once a month. Also, 84% of respondents think crypto payments will be common within five years, which shows a lot of business leaders expect wider use soon. Who’s Accepting Crypto Adoption is uneven. Big companies with annual revenue above $500 million lead the pack, with roughly 50% accepting crypto. Smaller shops lag at about 34%, while midsize firms sit near 32%. Travel and hospitality, gaming and digital goods, and higher-end retail are among the sectors pushing crypto forward. These markets often sell online or to tech-savvy buyers, so it makes sense they’d move faster. Crypto’s Role In Sales For merchants that already accept digital assets, crypto is not just an occasional trickle. Reports say digital assets account for over a quarter of sales for some of those sellers. Around 72% of current crypto-accepting merchants said their crypto sales grew over the past year. That kind of growth helps explain why firms want to keep the option available. Barriers And Bright Spots A common complaint is that setup is still too hard. Surveys found about 90% of merchants would accept crypto if it were as easy as taking a credit card. Payment tools and integration are top concerns. Merchants list faster payments, the chance to reach new customers, and better buyer privacy as reasons to accept crypto. Younger generations are pushing the trend too — Millennials and Gen Z buyers are often the ones asking to use crypto at checkout.

PayPal and the NCA put the findings in a public release at the end of January 2026. Many executives say the next step is simpler tools and clearer rules. If merchants get easier on-ramps and reliable rails for settlements, acceptance could spread faster. Featured image from PayPal Newsroom, chart from TradingView",
