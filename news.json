    "title": "Bitcoin Indicator Sounds Buy Alarm For The First Time Since March — Return To $110K Soon?",
    "body": "The price of Bitcoin has struggled around the $95,000 mark after showing some early-weekend strength on Saturday, November 15. According to a prominent analyst on the social media platform X, the premier cryptocurrency seems to be showing signs of a potential rebound in the coming days. BTC Price To Return To $110,000? In a November 15 post on X, market analyst Burak Kesmeci shared that the price of Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery based on different technical indicators. In his analysis, Kesmeci fiddled with the possibility of BTC rising to $110,000 and the risk of falling to $85,000. Firstly, Kesmeci analyzed the Bitcoin fear (VIX) score, a technical indicator that evaluates volatility and fear in the market. According to data provided by the analyst, this indicator has been above the crucial 16.50 level for two consecutive days for the first time in 250 days, suggesting the presence of a buy opportunity. Related Reading: Massive Bitcoin Bid Walls Spotted On Binance: Bulls Step In With 2,800 BTC Cluster However, Kesmeci also highlighted that this signal does not automatically confirm a price rebound for the premier cryptocurrency from the current point. This buy signal might even persist and intensify if the VIX indicator continues to decline in the oversold zone. The crypto analyst noted that the Bitcoin price reacted a little to the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) falling to 30, which marks the oversold territory. But Kesmeci mentioned that this RSI movement should offer little excitement, except if there is a positive divergence where RSI makes higher lows while price makes lower lows. Furthermore, Kesmeci examined the Fixed Range Volume Profile (FRVP), stating that there is a small gap with no volume between $95,000 and $85,000. According to the crypto analyst, a close below $95,000 could see the Bitcoin price fall—in a single candle—to as low as $85,000 in a bid to fill the FRVP gap. Kesmeci then hypothesized that holding above $95,000 could mean that Bitcoin is resting and building volume. With the current data suggesting that market makers are choosing to defend the $95,000, the crypto pundit believes that BTC could enjoy a reaction rally up toward $110,000, which is the real decision zone. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands around $95,076, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours.

    "body": "Ethereum price failed to stay above $3,250 and extended losses. ETH is down over 5% and might struggle to recover above $3,250 in the near term. Ethereum started a fresh decline after it failed to stay above $3,200. The price is trading below $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,160 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below the $3,000 zone. Ethereum Price Dips Further Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $3,350 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH price dipped below $3,200 and entered a bearish zone. The decline gathered pace below $3,150 and the price dipped below $3,050. A low was formed at $3,003 and the price is now correcting some losses. There was a move toward the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,560 swing high to the $3,003 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is another recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $3,160 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,160 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next key resistance is near the $3,280 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,560 swing high to the $3,003 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,350 level. A clear move above the $3,350 resistance might send the price toward the $3,450 resistance. An upside break above the $3,450 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,500 resistance zone or even $3,550 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,280 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,050 level. The first major support sits near the $3,000 zone. A clear move below the $3,000 support might push the price toward the $2,880 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,750 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,640 and $2,620.

    "title": "Dogecoin Price Could Bounce Very Quickly If This Happens At $0.166",
    "body": "The Dogecoin price has generally followed the trajectory of other altcoins relative to Bitcoin and has seen deeper declines compared to the pioneer cryptocurrency. These declines have left the leading meme coin by market cap in the red, pushing it back down to levels not seen since 2023. As a result, the Dogecoin price is now in a precarious position where it needs to make a major move or DOGE investors risk more decline as the altcoin struggles to find support. Next Trajectory For The Dogecoin Price Bitguru, in an analysis on X, outlined where the Dogecoin price is and what could determine the next move for the cryptocurrency. This all comes back to a critical level that would send the price in either direction, making it the point where both bulls and bears are now fighting for dominance, and this level is at 0.166. Related Reading: Analyst Breaks Down Why There Can’t Be 7 Million XRP Holders As the crypto analyst explains, the Dogecoin price has been in a clear downtrend already, and there has been no indication that it will actually pull out of this soon. If anything, sideways movement has been the order of the day, and catalysts that could trigger another rally have not been forthcoming. It so happens that the Dogecoin price ended up being rejected at $0.1823, which has been established to be a major high for the digital asset. Hence, it puts the sellers in control once again as the price moves toward $0.166. This $0.166 level lies above the major support at $0.16, meaning that it is imperative for bulls to actually reclaim and hold it. Another problem that the digital asset is facing at this point is that it continues to form lower highs. Naturally, this is a bearish development for any cryptocurrency as it means that buyers are weakening and sellers are gaining control in the market. If these lower highs continue, then it could see further decline for the Dogecoin price as opposed to a possible recovery. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Falling Because Of Strategy Sell-Offs? On-Chain Data Fuels Debate The Dogecoin price did try to rebound over the weekend, but was ultimately pushed back down as the Bitcoin price struggled at $95,000. Now, reclaiming the $0.166 is the next major task for bulls if the meme coin is to continue its ascent. In the event of a failure to reclaim $0.166 with momentum, then the Dogecoin price could correct lower. As the decline deepens, the next major support level lies firmly at $0.15, where there could be a wave of buying to trigger a short-term rise. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Tether’s $1B Neura Bet Puts AI Tokens In Focus As SUBBD Presale Heats Up",
    "body": "What to Know: Tether’s potential $1B+ funding role in Neura highlights aggressively crypto profits flows into real-world AI and robotics infrastructure. Neura’s humanoid robots target industrial and home use, while SUBBD Token focuses on ‘digital labor’ for creators through AI assistants and on-chain tools. Price predictions for $SUBBD map possible highs of $0.438 in 2025 and $0.668 in 2026. This implies about 7–12x upside from presale levels. SUBBD Token’s AI-powered creator platform, 20% staking rewards and large pre-built audience offer a way to play the AI-creator economy narrative. Tether is reportedly weighing a funding commitment of around $1.15B into German robotics firm Neura Robotics. The deal could value the startup between roughly $9.3B and $11.6B. That is a serious escalation in the crossover between crypto profits and real-world AI hardware. Neura builds humanoid robots designed for industrial and home use, and recent models like 4NE-1 handle tasks from sorting objects to cooking prep and box lifting. The systems lean heavily on AI for perception and continuous learning. Neura is also working with major chip providers to push that edge further. For Tether, this move fits a broader pattern. The $USDT issuer has generated more than $10B in profit this year and has started to redeploy capital into AI, data centers, energy infrastructure and Bitcoin mining. A potential billion-dollar ticket into humanoid robotics shows how aggressively crypto balance sheets now chase AI leverage. That kind of capital rotation matters well beyond Neura. It reinforces a simple message for the market: AI agents, whether they live in metal bodies or browser tabs, are the next big productivity layer. For an AI-driven Web3 project like SUBBD Token ($SUBBD), building a creator-focused AI agent ecosystem, that backdrop is the perfect macro narrative tailwind traders look for. With the $SUBBD presale already above $1.3M raised, a live token price at $0.05695 and fixed 20% staking rewards, the project sits at the intersection of AI tooling and the $85B creator economy. The question is how that combo might translate into upside if AI flows keep accelerating after headlines like Tether’s Neura bet. AI Robots, Digital Agents And The SUBBD Creator Stack Tether circling Neura is a signal that big crypto cash is comfortable owning core AI infrastructure, not just tokens with ‘AI’ in the ticker. Neura’s goal is simple: deploy autonomous, learning robots that handle repetitive labor in factories and homes. On the other side of the spectrum sits SUBBD Token ($SUBBD), which targets digital labor. Specifically, the time creators burn on DMs, admin, content planning and fan management. Instead of humanoid hardware, $SUBBD ships a stack of AI tools that sit between creators and their audiences. The SUBBD platform already anchors itself in a network of 2K+ top-earning creators with a combined following above 250M fans. The pain point is obvious for that crowd. Legacy platforms take high fees, fragment monetization between subscriptions, tips and sponsorships, and offer limited direct ownership of audience relationships. SUBBD Token’s answer is an AI-driven, tokenized subscription layer. The $SUBBD token functions as the unit of account for subscriptions, pay-per-view content, tips and gated access. Holders unlock discounts on content, exclusive drops, and ‘XP multipliers’ that reward deeper engagement. The roadmap leans heavily on AI ‘agents’ for creators. Upcoming features include AI profile generation, AI voice notes, AI video tools and AI livestreams that let creators automate parts of their presence without losing personality. Fans also get more benefits, while creators offload low-value work to AI and focus on content and brand deals. All of this targets an estimated $85B subscription-based content market. Many creators say they are actively hunting for better economics and more flexible tools. And if humanoid robots promise to reshape physical workflows, $SUBBD aims to do the same for digital creator workflows. For anyone tracking how AI narratives evolve from hardware (Neura) to consumer-facing apps, $SUBBD sits right in the ‘AI + creator economy’ sweet spot. Check how SUBBD lines up with your AI thesis. 💥 Join the $SUBBD presale on the official website. AI Crypto Project of the Future? $SUBBD Presale Roars On the numbers side, $SUBBD is still in presale with more than $1.3M raised so far. The current token price sits at $0.05695, with presale participants able to stake immediately for a fixed 20% APY, paid out after the presale concludes. ➡️ Here’s how to buy $SUBBD right now. Price-projection work from independent analysts sketches a base roadmap for what upside might look like if the platform executes. Our $SUBBD price prediction sees $SUBBD potentially reaching a high of $0.438 by the end of 2025 and up to $0.668 in 2026 if user traction, creator onboarding and exchange listings land as planned. Against today’s ~$0.05695 price, a move to $0.438 would mean ~7.7x, or ~670% gains on paper. A push to $0.668 would imply around 11.7x, in line with estimates that frame the 2026 upside at just over 1,070%. Run your own numbers, but if AI + creator economy is part of your 2025 thesis, you should give SUBBD Token a closer look. Get your $SUBBD for just $0.05695 right now.

    "title": "Alibaba’s Blockchain Payment Pivot Puts Best Wallet Token In Play",
    "body": "What to Know: Alibaba and JPMorgan are rolling out tokenized deposit rails for global B2B payments, compressing transaction settlement times from days to near-instant. Deposit tokens keep money inside the banking perimeter while using blockchain for speed, putting more pressure on wallet infrastructure to handle multiple forms of digital cash. Best Wallet combines a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet with a DEX aggregator, presale launchpad and planned card and analytics stack inside one mobile app. Best Wallet Token lets holders tap into that ecosystem through lower fees, boosted staking yields and early deal flow rather than pure price speculation. Alibaba’s global B2B arm is about to move serious money on-chain. The company will plug into JPMorgan’s JPMD infrastructure and Kinexys tokenization stack to settle cross-border trade using tokenized deposits backed by fiat currencies like the US dollar and the euro. These deposits behave a lot like stablecoins on the surface. But under the hood, they sit on regulated bank balance sheets. That keeps regulators comfortable and gives Alibaba near-instant settlements for global buyers and suppliers who currently wait 2–3 days and pass through multiple correspondent banks for a single payment. Alibaba plans to roll out its ‘Agentic Pay’ by December 2025. This will pair tokenized money with AI that can turn buyer–seller chats into executable smart contracts. The first phase will use bank-issued digital tokens to keep things clean from a policy and compliance standpoint, especially given Beijing’s hard line on stablecoins. For everyday users and smaller businesses, this shift has a simple implication. If big B2B platforms start settling value natively on-chain, wallets become the key interface to tokenized dollars, euros and everything in-between. Non-custodial, multi-chain wallets that can route value between deposit tokens, stablecoins and DeFi will sit right in the flow of this new money. That’s exactly the world Best Wallet is building for. And its in-app crypto wallet token, Best Wallet Token ($BEST), is designed to capture a share of that flow. Read more about Best Wallet Token in our review. Tokenized Deposits Put Wallet Infrastructure In The Spotlight Alibaba and JPMorgan are not experimenting with a meme coin. They’re wiring real-world payments where tokenized bank money moves across borders on a permissioned blockchain. All while plugging into familiar banking compliance checks. Deposit tokens effectively give institutions the UX of stablecoins without stepping outside the banking perimeter. That model is likely to spread because global trade runs on razor-thin margins and brutal settlement frictions. If one of the largest B2B platforms proves that a deposit-token rail can deliver near-instant settlement, lower FX and correspondent costs, and better transparency, competitors are not going to sit on the sidelines. In that environment, the ‘front end’ that users actually touch is the wallet, not the bank core. That’s where retail infrastructure meets institutional solutions. Tokenized deposits will mostly live in compliant, bank-linked environments. But users still need tools to route value into stablecoins, L2s, DeFi strategies and even early-stage token sales. Infrastructure that only does one chain, or only handles basic send-and-receive flows, starts to look dated fast. Best Wallet leans into that shift with a mobile-first, non-custodial design that already supports thousands of assets across 6+ chains and integrates a DEX aggregator for both same-chain and cross-chain swaps. Its whitepaper sets an aggressive goal: capture 40% of the crypto wallet market by the end of 2026, using Fireblocks MPC tech, a presale launchpad, and upcoming features like MEV protection, advanced order types and market analytics. If tokenized bank money becomes the norm for large-ticket payments, flexible wallets that can speak both ‘TradFi token’ and ‘DeFi native’ stand to win the most volume. Best Wallet is positioning itself as that hub, and the $BEST token is the mechanism that lets users share in the wallet’s growth through lower fees, boosted yields and governance. Here’s why. Best Wallet Token Turns A Non-Custodial App Into An Asset The Best Wallet Token ($BEST) token is wired directly into the wallet’s economics. Holding and staking $BEST unlocks reduced swap and card fees. It also unlocks higher staking rewards through an upcoming staking aggregator, priority access to some of the best crypto presales, governance rights, and boosted cashback on the forthcoming Best Card. Data from the live sale shows investors are already voting with their wallets. The presale has raised more than $17.1M, with the current token price at $0.025955 and the sale scheduled to end in 11 days. Whales are already acting, with one buying $32K yesterday. Staking is live during the presale, with dynamic rewards currently around 76% APY for early participants, funded from a dedicated 8% allocation of the total 10B token supply. 🤑 Here’s how to buy $BEST before the presale ends. Our Best Wallet Token price prediction places potential 2026 highs for $BEST at $0.05106175 or an ~100% upside , depending on how the presale closes, how quickly listings roll out and how strong the next altcoin rotation is. Crucially, those numbers are tied to real wallet usage, not just hype. Best Wallet already runs on Ethereum and is built to plug directly into the kind of regulated, tokenized rails Alibaba is helping normalize. It also gives users self-custody, no mandatory KYC in-app, and Fireblocks-grade security. For traders and long-term holders alike, $BEST effectively tokenizes that wallet business model. It’s a must-watch for anyone building a diversified bag around the emerging tokenized-payments narrative lit up by Alibaba and JPMorgan. Consider accumulating $BEST before listings.

    "title": "Best Wallet Token Presale Enters Final Stretch For DeFi",
    "body": "What to Know: Web3 wallets are becoming DeFi control centers, and Best Wallet targets that role with a multi-chain, MPC-secured, mobile-first app. $BEST powers fee discounts, staking boosts, early presale access, and governance, as well as card and iGaming perks inside the Best Wallet ecosystem. The $BEST presale ends in 11 days, on November 28, with $17M+ already raised and $BEST valued at $0.025955. Investors are already FOMO-diving into the presale, with a recent whale buy of $30,744 setting the pace for the remainder of the presale stage. Self custody is back in fashion. As regulation tightens and exchange blowups fade yet never quite disappear from memory, more users are parking assets in Web3 wallets. And they’re doing everything from swapping to staking without handing over their keys. That shift has put a spotlight on wallet-native tokens. Assets like Trust Wallet Token have shown that fee discounts, early access, and governance can give a wallet coin real staying power when the market turns risk on. This is the backdrop for Best Wallet Token ($BEST), the utility asset behind the Best Wallet ecosystem. The $BEST presale has already raised more than $17M, with the current token price at $0.025955 and headline staking yields in the high double digits, at 76% APY. The sale will reach its final conclusion on November 28, which leaves less than two weeks before the next phase of the project begins. Crucially, much of Best Wallet’s roadmap is still ahead of it. Features like a staking aggregator, Best Card, advanced trading tools, and gas-free transactions are mapped out but not fully live. That makes this final stretch of the presale effectively a bet on whether Best Wallet can turn its existing app into a full DeFi ecosystem over the next couple of years. ➡️ Discover more about the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) in our full review. Best Wallet Aims To Become A DeFi Control Center The Best Wallet app is already live as a non-custodial mobile crypto wallet with coming support for thousands of assets across more than 60 chains. 🔐 It uses Fireblocks’ MPC security, biometric login, and decentralized recovery rather than seed phrases, which is the kind of UX upgrade that helps new users stay on chain without sweating over losing a 12-word backup. The roadmap pushes that idea much further. Phase 3 will bring a portfolio management suite, browser extension, NFT gallery, derivatives trading, and a dedicated staking aggregator that promises higher yields with no extra wallet fees. Phase 4 will add market analytics, limit and stop loss orders, dollar cost averaging, MEV protection, and gas-free transactions, effectively turning the wallet into a full trading terminal. On top of this, Best Wallet hooks into iGaming partnerships and a planned Best Card debit product. 🏆 $BEST holders can earn higher cashback, better bonuses and reduced card fees, which pulls the token into real-world spending and gaming flows rather than leaving it as a pure governance chip. All of that utility revolves around $BEST. The token unlocks reduced swap and purchase fees, higher staking rewards, access to the best crypto presales in the in-app launchpad, and governance rights over future upgrades. If Best Wallet makes good on its plan to grow into a DeFi control center, that value should accrue first to long-term $BEST holders. ➡️ Check out our guide to buying $BEST. Final BEST Presale Phase Targets Yield And Upside The $BEST presale began in November 2024 and has moved through a long ladder of incremental price steps. 💰 After passing the $17M mark and climbing to $0.025955, the token now sits in its final stage, with the presale due to end on November 28. The global crypto wallet market, currently valued at around $15.5B, is forecast to have a hefty CAGR of 26.3%, reaching $110.7B by 2033. Best Wallet plans to dominate 40% of that market by the end of next year, which is why a fully funded roadmap is key. That’s where $BEST’s capital raise matters. Its tokenomics are relatively simple. There is a fixed supply of 10B $BEST. One-quarter is earmarked for product development, more than a third for marketing, and 8% for staking rewards, with the rest split between airdrops, exchange liquidity, community incentives and treasury. That mix leans heavily into growth and user acquisition, which makes sense for a wallet trying to win that 40% share in a crowded market. 🚀 Given Best Wallet’s ecosystem utility and long-term goals, our price prediction for $BEST sees it potentially reaching $0.05106175 by the end of 2026, once the implementation phase kicks off. Using the current presale price of $0.025955, that implies potential upside of close to 97% to the 2026 high, although actual performance will depend on adoption, listings and macro conditions. This performance and price projection makes $BEST one of the best crypto presales of 2025. Investors continue to tune in, with a recent $30,744 whale buy setting the pace for the rest of the remaining 11 days. Ready to jump in? Buy $BEST before the presale ends.

    "body": "US President Donald Trump on Friday voiced support for a Senate measure that would let the US impose tariffs of up to 500% on imports from nations still buying Russian energy. “It would be okay with me,” he said. Related Reading: From Dotcom To Crypto: Veteran Analyst Says The Bull Run Isn’t Over Based on reports, the proposal names oil, natural gas, petroleum products and uranium as covered goods and highlights major buyers such as India and China. The move is described as a tool meant to squeeze Russia’s export revenues, but the measure remains proposed and has not become law. Tariffs Up To 500% On Energy Imports Reports have disclosed that the bill would give the President authority to slap punitive duties — as high as 500% — on goods coming from any country judged to be materially trading in Russian energy. JUST IN: 🇺🇸🇷🇺 President Trump approves bill allowing 500% tariffs on countries trading with Russia. pic.twitter.com/qaBKVUMwTN — BRICS News (@BRICSinfo) November 17, 2025 Lawmakers behind the text say the measure targets energy purchases that help fund Moscow. How the tariff would be applied, and the exact list of goods and exceptions, is still being worked out in committee. Legal experts warn that a 500% duty would raise immediate questions about trade rules and possible retaliation. Immediate Shock To Risk Assets Markets reacted fast. Crypto traders moved to the exits in the first hours after the news, pushing volatility up across major tokens. Nearly $620 million in crypto positions were liquidated in 24 hours, forcing over 152,000 traders out, with a single $30 million BTC-USD order on Hyperliquid being the largest hit. Major altcoins like XRP, Solana, and Cardano saw sharp swings, and Ethereum dropped toward the $3,000 level. Bitcoin took a 1% hit following the news. In the last week, BTC has lost close to 10% of its value since hitting an all-time high of $126k on October 6, 2025. The crypto market is highly sensitive to geopolitical trade shocks. Analysts warn that a proposed 500% tariff on countries trading with Russia—significantly higher than past rates that caused a $200 billion wipeout—could trigger severe panic selling. Analysts believe that if the large-scale tariff is brought into effect, its short-term effect could decrease Bitcoin and major altcoins’ prices by 10% to 20% due to increased economic uncertainty and panic. Related Reading: Forget The Obituaries—Cardano Is Alive, Says Bitcoin Analyst Wider Economic Ripples And Energy Prices If the tariffs were ever applied, energy flows would be disrupted. That could push crude and gas prices higher, and higher energy costs usually feed into inflation. Central banks might respond by holding rates higher for longer, which can hurt risk assets including crypto. Yet, history shows that once a new price regime takes hold, people sometimes seek alternatives to cash and bank deposits. That dynamic is part of why crypto markets are watching this proposal so closely. Featured image from David Hume Kennerly/Getty Images, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Price Just Flashed A Death Cross, But It’s Not What You Think",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Colin has revealed that the Bitcoin price has flashed a death cross, which he noted was bullish for the flagship crypto. This comes amid BTC’s recent decline, which has erased all its year-to-date (YTD) gains. Bitcoin Price Flashes Death Cross, Marking Potential Bottom In an X post, Colin stated that a death cross just flashed for the Bitcoin price, with the “ironically” bullish indicator triggering at the same time that BTC tagged the lower boundary of its megaphone pattern. The analyst noted that this is a bullish setup from this point forward, as the death cross often marks bottoms. He indicated that this is likely the bottom, as BTC has ended at the lower end of the megaphone pattern channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Won’t Crash To $92,000, Here’s Why Colin remarked that these factors combined indicate a high likelihood of a move up for the Bitcoin price from its current level. He added that a bounce is likely in the short term. However, the analyst noted that the bigger question is whether this would be a bounce to new all-time highs (ATHs) or just a relief rally on the way down in a bear market. Regardless of what happens, he is optimistic that an upward move will occur in the short term. Colin also alluded to the fact that the Federal Reserve will end quantitative tightening (QT) by December, a move which he described as another bullish catalyst for the Bitcoin price. This move is expected to inject more liquidity into the BTC and possibly spark higher prices for the flagship crypto. The Fed could also cut rates again at the December FOMC meeting, which would be a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin. Another Analyst Confirms Death Cross Popular crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen also confirmed that the Bitcoin price just had a death cross. He noted that prior death crosses have marked local lows in the market. However, he added that the death cross rally fails when the cycle is over, which could be the case this time if the bull market is over. Related Reading: Why Are The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Down Again? Cowen stated that the time for the Bitcoin price to bounce if the cycle is not over would start within the next week. The analyst further remarked that if no bounce occurs within one week, another dump is likely before a larger rally back to the 200D SMA, which he claimed would mark a macro lower high. Meanwhile, market analyst Subu Trade shared data on how BTC has reacted after historical death crosses. The last death cross occurred in April this year, and the flagship crypto recorded a 22% gain following it. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $95,100, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pngtree, chart from Tradingview.com",
