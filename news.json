    "title": "Cardano Recovery Signals Risk On As Traders Eye Best Wallet Token Presale",
    "body": "What to Know: Cardano’s 6% open interest jump as $ADA eyes a $0.50 retest points to leveraged traders positioning for continuation, not a fleeting relief rally. As DeFi and real‑world use cases expand on Cardano and beyond, non‑custodial, multi‑chain wallets are becoming critical infrastructure rather than optional add‑ons. Many legacy wallets remain either centralized with single points of failure or too clunky on mobile, leaving a gap for secure, feature‑rich, user‑friendly alternatives. Best Wallet Presale targets 40% of the wallet market by 2026, merging Fireblocks MPC‑CMP security, multi‑wallet portfolios and mobile‑first UX into a single $BEST‑powered ecosystem. Cardano’s latest bounce is starting to look like more than a relief rally. Derivatives data shows $ADA open interest jumping roughly 6% as price circles a potential retest of the $0.50 area , a level that rejected bulls earlier in the year and now acts as a clear psychological and technical barrier for traders. When open interest rises into resistance like this, it usually means leveraged money is stepping in, not just casual spot buyers averaging in. That tilt toward futures exposure tends to signal traders are positioning for continuation rather than a dead cat bounce, especially when liquidations stay controlled and funding doesn’t spike into obvious froth. Under the hood, Cardano’s DeFi and real‑world use cases have quietly expanded, giving this move some fundamental backing. TVL has climbed from cycle lows , stablecoin activity is more diversified, and on‑chain volume isn’t being driven purely by speculative memecoins. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now , $ADA’s mix of rising OI, key resistance overhead and improving on‑chain metrics keeps it firmly on the watchlist. But that broader ‘risk‑on’ shift is also pushing capital further out the curve into infrastructure plays and presales. Wallet infrastructure in particular looks primed for a re‑rating as users demand safer self‑custody, better presale access and cheaper cross‑chain execution. And that’s the backdrop where projects like Best Wallet and its Best Wallet Token ($BEST) utility token are starting to attract more serious attention from investors already leaning bullish on higher‑beta crypto exposure. Read more about $BEST in our guide. How Cardano’s Risk-On Shift Is Reshaping Wallet Demand A market where $ADA can credibly threaten a sustained break above $0.50 is a market where users are once again rotating into higher‑beta altcoins, NFTs, on‑chain games and complex DeFi positions. That activity doesn’t just lift prices; it dramatically increases the demand for non‑custodial wallets that can handle dozens of chains and asset types without forcing users into centralized chokepoints. The problem is that many of the incumbent wallets were designed for a simpler era. Centralized or semi‑custodial designs create single points of failure and regulatory risk, while some of the more trust‑minimized options still feel clunky on mobile. If you’ve ever tried to manage multiple DeFi portfolios, presales and cross‑chain swaps from your phone, you’ve probably felt those UX and security trade‑offs firsthand. That’s why the next wave of wallet competition is moving beyond ‘basic key storage’ into full‑stack execution layers: integrated DEX aggregation, curated presales, staking dashboards and chain‑agnostic portfolios. One of these solutions is making the rounds now – Best Wallet positions $BEST as one more option in this emerging class, but with a thesis built around deeply integrated security tech and a mobile‑first design. Why Best Wallet Token Is Drawing Risk-On Capital Where Best Wallet differentiates itself is the attempt to bundle institutional‑grade security with retail‑level accessibility. The project is building what it calls the first fully integrated Fireblocks MPC‑CMP wallet in a consumer app, combining multi‑party computation for key management with custom multi‑wallet portfolios. In plain English, that means you retain self‑custody while dramatically reducing single‑key compromise risk across every asset you hold. On top of that security stack, the wallet plans to embed an ‘Upcoming Tokens’ portal, giving users a simplified flow to access crypto presales without hopping between websites, spreadsheets and Telegram groups. For a market already hunting for ‘the next ADA’ every time open interest spikes, that kind of curated deal flow directly inside a wallet could become a compelling value add if the screening standards hold up. Execution is equally important. Best Wallet’s DEX aggregator, powered by Rubic, targets more than 50 chains, 300+ DEXs and 30 cross‑chain bridges from a single interface, with a mobile‑first UX designed to feel familiar even if you’re not a DeFi power user. That multi‑chain reach combined with non‑custodial, no‑KYC access aims to serve both advanced traders rotating between Cardano, Ethereum and emerging ecosystems, and newcomers who just want cheaper swaps and fewer failed transactions. Underneath it all sits the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , which fuels a set of incentives inside the ecosystem. The presale has already raised $17.64M at a token price of $0.026005, and smart money is also paying attention: whale tracker data reveals 2 significant purchases totaling $29.8K, with the largest transaction of $16K happening just yesterday . Plus, our $BEST price prediction estimates a potential increase of 97% by the end of 2026 from the current price of $0.026005. For traders already leaning risk‑on thanks to Cardano’s recovery, that mix of security features, presale upside and yield mechanics makes $BEST an increasingly visible candidate for the next wave of wallet‑centric narratives. Buy $BEST in 5 simple steps before the presale ends. This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, investment, or trading advice; always do your own research.

    "title": "Ethereum’s End-Of-Year Rally Still At Play? Analysts Eye 50% December Jump",
    "body": "Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to bounce from the market’s Q4 correction, retesting the $3,000 barrier once again. As we approach the end of November, some market observers have suggested that the end-of-year rally may still be possible in the coming weeks. Related Reading: XRP ETFs Outshine BTC, ETH, And SOL Funds With $164M Single-Day Inflows Ethereum Eyes $3,000 Ahead Of Key Upgrade On Wednesday, Ethereum experienced a 4.4% daily surge, retesting the $3,000 level for the first time in nearly a week. The cryptocurrency has been trading within the $2,680-$2,980 price range amid the latest market-wide correction, which also saw Bitcoin (BTC) lose some crucial support levels. At the start of the week, the King of Altcoins broke above the $2,900 area, attempting to retest the next key resistance over the past two days but ultimately failing to reclaim it. Analyst Ted Pillows highlighted this performance, noting that ETH “tapped the $2,950-$3,000 zone again and got rejected.” Per the post, until Ethereum successfully reclaims this level, “the chances of a new low are high.” On the contrary, if the cryptocurrency breaks above this zone with strong volume in the coming days, investors could “expect a rally towards the $3,400 level.” The analyst also suggested that the altcoin could see a remarkable recovery rally next week, driven by the upcoming Fusaka upgrade. As he explained, ETH soared around 50% after the network’s Pectra upgrade in May. As reported by NewsBTC, the upgrade introduced a series of improvements to increase transaction capacity, enhance efficiency, and reduce system stress. Following the implementation, the cryptocurrency rallied from the $1,800 level to the $2,700 area in a week, which was later followed by an 80% jump in Q3 to its latest all-time high (ATH) of $4,946. Now, the Fusaka upgrade is the network’s biggest update since The Merge and is expected to come on December 3, “to relieve one of the network’s most pressing bottlenecks: data availability for rollups,” VanEck explained in October. Based on this, Ted Pillows suggested that if ETH repeats its post-Pectra performance with the new upgrade, the altcoin’s price could soar above the $4,000 resistance in the next few weeks. End-Of-Year Rally Underway? Market watcher Merlijn The Trader also suggested that Ethereum could see another leg up soon, as it is “repeating a textbook wave structure” it has printed multiple times since hitting the bear market bottom in mid-2022. “Wave 1: Kicked off the cycle. Wave 2: Is shaking weak hands. wave 3: Where parabolas form,” the trader explained on X, noting that ETH could be ending its corrective move and potentially see another rally in the coming weeks. “This pattern printed 3 times before. Each time, ETH went vertical. Now it’s flashing again,” he stated. Similarly, Michaël van de Poppe highlighted Ethereum’s trading pair against Bitcoin, affirming that investors should keep an eye on the chart. Notably, ETH is retesting a multi-month downtrend line resistance against BTC, and could “see a strong breakout upwards in the coming weeks.” “This cycle is far from over,” van de Poppe added.

As of this writing, ETH trades at $3,023, a 2% increase in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Price Climbs Back To $91,000: Is The Decline Over? Key Levels To Watch",
    "body": "The Bitcoin price appears to be entering a new recovery phase, as the leading cryptocurrency recaptured the $91,000 level after falling by more than 30% from all-time highs last Friday, tumbling to an 8-month low of $80,000. Critical Bitcoin Price Range Technical analyst Daan Crypto Trades highlighted on social media site X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday that the critical region for investors to monitor right now is between the $89,000 and $91,000 range. He observed that this price level acted as support in late 2024 and early 2025 before becoming a point of resistance during President Donald Trump’s recent tariff negotiations with the world’s top economies, including China. Related Reading: Has The Bitcoin Price Hit Its Bottom? Key On-Chain Data Signals Potential Rebound Ahead After breaking out of this zone almost exactly one year ago, the Bitcoin price reached new highs of $109,000 in January, which held until a new uptrend in May of this year resulted in BTC reaching $112,000. Daan emphasizes that a strong consolidation above these levels could pave the way for a rally toward the $106,000 to $108,000 range. Conversely, if Bitcoin falls back below these levels, it could revisit last week’s low of $80,000, which he identifies as the nearest support. Bullish Sentiments Amid Caution Another analyst, BitcoinVector, echoed Daan’s bullish sentiment but cautioned that the market remains in a high-risk environment and that the current momentum has yet to strengthen significantly. According to BitcoinVector, steady momentum is required for Bitcoin to break out of the compression pattern that has formed since its all-time high. He laid out the bullish path: first, the Bitcoin price must close within the $89,000 to $90,000 zone, followed by consolidation above this area, and finally, a breakout through the $93,500 to $95,000 compression band. For this recovery to gain traction, BitcoinVector stressed the importance of a “Risk-Off Signal,” indicating that buyers must begin to overpower sellers while generating momentum. Without such momentum, each upward movement would merely be a tactical reaction rather than indicative of a structural recovery. Prolonged Bear Market Ahead? Market analyst Skew provided additional insights, noting that the four-hour chart for Bitcoin appears more constructive for bulls. He pointed to several indicators suggesting upward momentum, including the price being above the four-hour 50 EMA, the RSI remaining above 50, and the Stochastic RSI trending higher. Skew identifies the $88,000 mark as a crucial “line in the sand,” arguing that a drop below this level would signal weakness and a failed attempt to gain momentum. Related Reading: Tether Faces Downgrade By S&P Global Amid Concerns Over Disclosure And Assets Holdings Despite the cautious optimism from some analysts, others, like Jacob King, offer a starkly different perspective. He argues that given the Bitcoin price decline from its all-time high in October, it has never experienced such a fall followed by a sustained bull market. According to King, Bitcoin is now in a bear market that may persist for years, poised to affect the fortunes of countless investors, particularly those heavily leveraged. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at $91,390, marking a 4% recovery within the last 24 hours. This places the cryptocurrency 27% below its all-time high.

    "title": "Next Crypto To Explode As Strategy Proves Bitcoin Reserves Can Easily Cover Its Debt",
    "body": "What to Know: Strategy’s new ‘Bitcoin Rating’ shows its $BTC stack covers convertible debt by about 5.9x at its average entry and would stay near 2x even in a deep crash, underlining how levered it is to long-term $BTC upside. Despite that cushion, institutions are bailing on the stock and moving into spot Bitcoin ETFs instead, leaving Strategy out of the S&P 500 and trading below the value of its own $BTC holdings. Bitcoin Hyper’s presale is building an SVM-based Bitcoin Layer 2 with near-instant, low-fee smart contracts and DeFi that settles back to Bitcoin, giving $BTC holders a scaling and yield angle instead of just spot exposure. PEPENODE’s presale pushes a mine-to-earn meme model where you buy virtual nodes, build a digital mining rig, and earn $PEPENODE plus other meme coins, with node upgrades and token burns tying demand to in-game activity. Corporate Bitcoin strategy hits differently when it’s backed by hard numbers instead of doompost threads. A 5.9x asset‑to‑debt ratio at the average $BTC cost basis, and even 2x coverage if Bitcoin nukes to $25K, is exactly the kind of balance‑sheet resilience big money cares about. When the top asset on corporate books still comfortably covers obligations after a deep crash, the signal isn’t ‘risk off’ – it’s that Bitcoin has matured into collateral that institutions actually trust. That trust doesn’t just sit in cold wallets; it becomes the backdrop for the next wave of risk‑on bets. Historically, when the market accepts Bitcoin as sound collateral, the next move is usually into high‑beta plays that can ride the same long‑term conviction with far larger upside. That’s where presales, aggressive Layer 2s, and high‑throughput chains tend to explode, turning $BTC strength into altcoin momentum. Below are three projects positioned to benefit from this environment – led by Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin Layer 2 trying to do for $BTC what high‑performance chains did for DeFi elsewhere, alongside Solana‑style execution and Tron’s stablecoin machine. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): SVM Speed On A Bitcoin Layer 2 Bitcoin Hyper pitches itself as ‘the fastest Bitcoin Layer 2 Chain’ with integrated Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), aiming to deliver faster performance than Solana itself while anchoring to Bitcoin for settlement. The idea is simple: keep Bitcoin as the base layer of trust, outsource speed and programmability to a purpose‑built Layer 2. Under the hood, Bitcoin Hyper uses a modular design: Bitcoin L1 for settlement and a real‑time SVM Layer 2 for high‑throughput execution. A single trusted sequencer batches transactions and periodically anchors state back to Bitcoin, enabling sub‑second confirmation at low cost instead of waiting for slow on‑chain $BTC finality and paying full L1 fees. This architecture attacks Bitcoin’s three core limitations at once: slow transactions, high fees, and lack of native smart contracts. On Bitcoin Hyper, you get extremely low‑latency processing, SVM‑based smart contracts, and SPL‑compatible tokens adapted for the L2. That opens the door to wrapped $BTC payments, AMMs, lending markets, staking protocols, NFTs, and gaming dApps built in Rust with SDKs and APIs developers already know. Here’s how to buy $HYPER before the presale ends tomorrow. The presale has raised $28.58M, with tokens at $0.013335, and staking is set at 40%, so there are long-term gains to be made alongside price appreciation. Join the $HYPER presale today. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): Mine-To-Earn Meme With Node Economics If Bitcoin Hyper is the infrastructure bet, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is the speculative meme play wrapped in a pseudo‑mining economy. Branded as the world’s first mine-to-earn memecoin, it swaps hash rate and ASICs for a virtual mining system where users deploy ‘nodes’ through a gamified dashboard to earn token emissions. Instead of proof‑of‑work, PEPENODE uses tiered node rewards to simulate miner economics. Higher‑tier nodes are designed to capture larger slices of emissions, encouraging early participation and laddering up through the system. Eventually, you’ll be able to receive rewards on popular meme coins like Fartcoin and Pepe. It’s a familiar pattern from DeFi node projects, but re‑skinned for meme traders who want something more interactive than simply buying and waiting. Despite the playful branding, there’s real capital flowing in. The PEPENODE presale has raised $2.2M with tokens at $0.0011685, putting it firmly in micro‑cap territory where order‑book depth will matter but upside can be violent if the narrative catches a bid. Our PEPENODE price prediction puts a potential 2026 price at $0.0071, which is a 508% increase from the current price. Staking isn’t specified yet, so yield for now is focused on the virtual mining mechanics and node tiers. In a market where Bitcoin is proving itself as a durable treasury asset, memes like PEPENODE sit at the opposite end of the risk curve: pure beta with a gamified wrapper. If you’re looking for exposure that can move multiples faster than $BTC on narrative alone, the mine‑to‑earn angle aims directly at that demand. Join the PEPENODE presale now. 3. Tron (TRX): Stablecoin Workhorse With Massive USDT Flows Tron (TRX) remains one of the purest expressions of ‘blockchain as payments rail’ in the market. It’s a high‑throughput network designed for fast, low‑cost transactions and dApp deployment, but its real edge today is stablecoins: Tron has become a major hub for $USDT transfers across exchanges and payment platforms. With high TPS and tiny fees, Tron quietly turned into the default settlement layer for a big chunk of crypto’s dollar liquidity. Recently, it even surpassed Ethereum in total circulating $USDT, reaching about $73.8B, underscoring how much real transactional flow now prefers Tron’s cost structure over more expensive chains for day‑to‑day movement. That stablecoin gravity feeds into a growing DeFi and cross‑chain ecosystem, where users can tap lending, swaps, and yield strategies without abandoning the payment rails they already use. In a market where Bitcoin is the collateral anchor, Tron offers exposure to the transactional layer of crypto dollars. And the token is showing signs of recovery from the recent market dump, with a 1% increase in the last day. You can get Tron from Binance. Recap: When corporate treasuries show Bitcoin reserves still comfortably covering debt even in a deep crash, it sets the stage for high‑beta plays. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) stand out as the most direct bets in the current market.

    "title": "Analyst Says Get Ready For XRP Price Above $4 This Cycle",
    "body": "Despite the XRP price struggling to stay afloat in the current market, it has not deterred the bulls from continuing to push for higher prices. This is amid the XRP ETF launches that have taken place over the last week, X triggering a significant amount of inflow into the cryptocurrency. The calls for new all-time high prices to surpass its 2018 $3.84 peak have only grown louder, with timelines getting shorter. This time around, one analyst has predicted a new all-time high, with what they call a “true Elliot Wave view.” Why XRP Price Could Still Gun Above $4 In an analysis shared on X with over 35,000 followers, crypto analyst XForce Global has put forward the idea that the Elliot Wave Theory has not completely played out for the XRP price. So far, the belief has been that the XRP price has completed the last and final wave and could be headed into a bear market. However, the crypto analyst doesn’t believe this is the case. Related Reading: XRP Price Will Climb Above $10 When This Happens: Analyst XForce Global points to the fact that analysts who use the Elliot Wave theory could struggle with the chart they shared. But this chart apparently removes all of the market inefficiencies, allowing the XRP price to be viewed through a clear lens. The analysis suggests that the altcoin could see a bullish continuation, running a flat route upward after hitting support above $1.87. Such a surge would put the XRP price on the path above $4, with the digital asset possibly topping above $5. In the event that the price does crash further than the current local lows, the analyst believes that an expanded flat route beginning above $1.6 would still trigger a similar outcome. Both rallies are expected to push the XRP price above $4 and then top toward $6. Major Factor To Drive Price Explosion One major factor that analysts have put forward to drive an XRP price explosion is the launch of XRP ETFs. With more than 3 XRP ETFs now trading in the US, analyst Chad Steingraber has outlined how their launch could affect the altcoin’s price. Related Reading: Financial Strategist Debunks Prediction That Bitcoin Price Will Reach $220,000 In 45 Days Steingraber explained that, so far, the XRP price had been seeing some uptick during ETF trading hours, and then declining during off-hours. This is building pressure and momentum, and is expected to accumulate over time. The result of this is supposed to be a major price explosion in the next few months, possibly pushing XRP to new peaks. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Best Crypto Presales to Buy as Top Trader Eyes 25% Solana Recovery And Risk On Rotation",
    "body": "What to Know: Bitcoin Hyper utilizes a modular Bitcoin-settlement plus SVM-execution design to integrate high-speed, low-fee smart contracts directly into the Bitcoin ecosystem. $HYPER’s presale and whale activity signal growing conviction in Bitcoin Layer 2 narratives as traders rotate back into risk assets. SUBBD targets the $85B creator economy by merging AI tools, token‑gated content, and crypto payments with 20% first‑year staking. LiquidChain’s Layer-3 architecture aims to unify BTC, ETH, and SOL liquidity, positioning LIQUID as a longer-term cross-chain DeFi infrastructure bet. A top trader calling for a 25% Solana rebound is exactly the kind of spark that can flip the market from defensive to risk-on in a heartbeat. When majors like SOL, BTC, and ETH stop leaking and start grinding higher, traders suddenly remember that upside volatility hits just as hard as the downside. Historically, the script has never changed. Once the large caps stabilize and push up, liquidity rotates into higher-beta plays, the small caps, narrative tokens, and presales, where a 2x is considered the warm-up, not the victory lap. Majors lead the move, but the real fireworks usually happen lower down the risk curve. That’s why presales matter in this setup. You still get the tailwind of improving macro and stronger majors, but you’re positioning before CEX listings, before full marketing cycles, and before retail FOMO starts tripping over itself. Instead of hoping Solana delivers a clean 25%, you’re looking at projects building the next wave of DeFi, Bitcoin scaling, infra, and cross-chain liquidity. Below are three presale-stage projects aligned with exactly that rotation: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) — bringing SVM-style speed and parallel execution to Bitcoin SUBBD ($SUBBD) — where AI creator tools and Web3 payments collide LiquidChain (LIQUID) — a unified liquidity layer spanning Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) — First Bitcoin Layer-2 With SVM Speed If Solana really does lead the next risk-on bounce, the obvious second-order trade is throughput pressure on the chains it competes with, and none feels that more than Bitcoin. Bitcoin Hyper positions itself as the first Bitcoin Layer-2 to integrate the Solana Virtual Machine, targeting execution speeds that can rival, and potentially surpass, Solana’s own performance. Instead of trying to contort Bitcoin into a full smart-contract environment at L1, Bitcoin Hyper takes the modular route: Bitcoin for settlement, SVM for real-time execution. The result is sub-second finality, ultra-low latency, and high-speed transactions for wrapped BTC — all without compromising the base layer’s security guarantees. On the application side, $HYPER unlocks everything Bitcoin can’t natively support today: Full DeFi rails including swaps, lending, and staking High-throughput NFT marketplaces Gaming dApps and on-chain assets All of this runs on an SVM environment with Rust-based SDKs and APIs. SPL-compatible tokens can be deployed directly to the L2, giving Solana builders a familiar toolchain while tapping into deep Bitcoin liquidity. Presale momentum reinforces the narrative. The Bitcoin Hyper presale has raised over $28.5M, with tokens priced at $0.013335, placing it in late-stage, high-conviction territory rather than the usual micro-cap experiment. Smart money has noticed too: two high-net-worth wallets accumulated $396K in recent weeks, including a single $53K buy, a move that lines up with our own Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , which forecasts a potential 2030 high of around $0.253, roughly a 22x jump from current presale levels. The token design leans into long-term alignment, with staking rewards currently sitting at 40%, a short seven-day vesting period for presale stakers, and a reward structure built to encourage real network participation rather than pure emissions farming. For traders rotating part of their BTC exposure into Bitcoin-secured yield and high-beta infrastructure plays, the $HYPER presale is a clean, asymmetric bet on the next phase of Bitcoin scaling. 2. SUBBD ($SUBBD) — AI + Web3 Rail for the Creator Economy While traders obsess over Solana’s order books, another macro trend has been ripping completely on its own timeline: AI-powered content creation. SUBBD is going straight after the $85 billion creator economy with a Web3 + AI stack built to give creators more control, fewer fees, and a native way to monetize without feeding Web2 intermediaries. At its core, SUBBD is an AI-driven content creation and distribution platform. Creators can launch AI Personal Assistants to handle fan interactions, generate AI voice clones, and even deploy fully AI-generated influencers. All of this ties into token-gated content, subscription layers, and crypto payments, so revenue flows directly to the creator rather than being skimmed by middlemen. The presale numbers show the story is landing. SUBBD has raised $1,366,940.49, with tokens priced at $0.05705, signaling early but meaningful conviction from investors who see AI + ownership as a long-term macro pair. A 20% first-year staking yield adds a clear incentive for holders who want to participate in the ecosystem rather than just rotate in and out. For traders, SUBBD offers something distinct from the typical L1/L2 infrastructure play, exposure to AI-powered creator tooling, where the upside depends on user adoption, rather than gas fees or TPS bragging rights. And in a risk-on environment, narratives at the intersection of AI, social, and crypto tend to move quickly. If you want a deeper dive into potential long-term upside, our SUBBD price prediction breaks down the full forecast. 3. LiquidChain (LIQUID) — A Layer-3 Unifying BTC, ETH, and SOL Liquidity If Bitcoin Hyper is the bet on scaling Bitcoin and SUBBD is the bet on creators, LiquidChain (LIQUID) is the bet on where cross-chain DeFi is heading next. It’s a Layer-3 blockchain built to unify Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana into a single execution environment so liquidity, collateral, and dApps can actually move together, not in three different silos. Instead of relying on wrapped assets, LiquidChain is built around unified liquidity pools across BTC, ETH, and SOL. That means capital can be deployed without the usual friction associated with wrapping/unwrapping. A high-performance virtual machine handles real-time cross-chain execution, while trust-minimized proof systems verify UTXOs and state across all three major chains. In practice, that could look like a trader opening a leveraged position using BTC collateral against an ETH-denominated yield strategy, or a protocol routing orders through SOL and ETH liquidity without the user touching a bridge at all. As risk-on rotations send capital bouncing between ecosystems, infra that smooths those jumps tends to gain relevance fast. LiquidChain is still in an early stage, with presale momentum reportedly surpassing $40,000 raised and more than 3.3 million tokens staked during initial participation. The team is targeting a 2026 mainnet launch, framing LIQUID as a longer-dated multichain bet rather than a quick, speculative flip. Recap: As a 25% Solana recovery call nudges sentiment back toward risk-on, presales like Bitcoin Hyper, SUBBD , and LiquidChain offer higher-beta exposure to core narratives, Bitcoin scaling, AI-driven creator tools, and unified cross-chain liquidity. Of the three, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the cleanest asymmetric bet on Bitcoin’s next DeFi chapter.

    "title": "Bitcoin Price Could Rally Toward $93K As Bulls Look To Bitcoin Hyper Presale",
    "body": "What to Know: Bitcoin trading in a tight range below resistance often pushes traders toward higher‑beta assets that still track the underlying BTC macro trend. Infrastructure that makes Bitcoin more usable for payments, DeFi, and smart contracts is increasingly seen as a leveraged way to express long‑term BTC conviction. Bitcoin Hyper integrates an SVM‑powered Layer 2 with Bitcoin settlement, targeting low‑latency smart contracts to tackle BTC’s speed and programmability limits. Range-bound markets with upside potential toward levels like $93,000 can create strong narratives for BTC-aligned scaling plays and yield-bearing ecosystems. Bitcoin has spent weeks moving sideways, with bulls still eyeing a breakout toward the $93K zone even as heavy resistance sits just overhead. In this kind of late-cycle chop, tactical traders often look for higher-beta ways to express the same bullish thesis without simply adding more spot BTC. Rather than chasing marginal upside on a trillion-dollar asset, many rotate into narratives that closely track Bitcoin but offer structurally higher torque if the next leg higher begins. Bitcoin Layer 2s and yield-bearing BTC ecosystems are at the center of that shift, especially with fees elevated and block space still constrained. That’s where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) enters the conversation. It’s pitching itself as a Bitcoin-aligned execution layer that feels closer to Solana in speed and throughput while still ultimately settling on Bitcoin. For traders, the appeal is twofold: exposure to BTC’s macro trend plus additional upside from payments, DeFi, and staking activity built on top of it. If Bitcoin does grind toward $93K in the months ahead, infrastructure that makes BTC faster, programmable, and yield-generating could attract outsized flows. Early access via the Bitcoin Hyper presale offers a way to stay positioned for Bitcoin’s broader move while taking on a more aggressive risk-reward profile than holding spot alone. Independent explainers are already unpacking where Bitcoin Hyper sits in the emerging Layer-2 race. Why Range‑Bound Bitcoin Pushes Flows Toward Higher‑Beta BTC Plays When Bitcoin spends weeks consolidating just beneath resistance, every new dollar of capital starts asking the same question: where does the risk pay off best? Historically, these conditions have pushed flows toward higher-beta expressions of the same macro view, leveraged derivatives, volatile altcoins, or infrastructure tokens that sit one layer out from BTC but still move in tandem with it. Layer-2 infrastructure has increasingly been the standout beneficiary. On Ethereum, rollup tokens and staking derivatives often outperform during consolidation because they enhance usability and unlock new yield on the base asset. A similar pattern is now emerging around Bitcoin as traders weigh Lightning, scaling-oriented sidechains, and next-generation programmable environments built on BTC collateral. Multiple architectures are competing to solve Bitcoin’s long-standing trade-offs between security, throughput, and programmability, from payment-channel networks to EVM-compatible sidechains to full smart-contract environments that settle back to Bitcoin. Within that mix, Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as a high-beta way to express the same core BTC thesis rather than a detached speculation play. A recent Bitcoin Hyper price-prediction breakdown has already started framing it in exactly that context. How Bitcoin Hyper Turns BTC Into a High‑Speed, Yield‑Bearing Asset Zooming in, Bitcoin Hyper positions itself as the first Bitcoin Layer 2 to integrate the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), aiming to deliver execution speeds that rival, and in some cases surpass, Solana’s own environment. In practical terms, that means sub-second finality and ultra-low-latency processing for payments, DeFi, NFTs, and gaming, all while anchoring settlement and security back to Bitcoin. Its architecture is fully modular: Bitcoin L1 provides settlement, the real-time SVM Layer 2 handles smart-contract execution and high-throughput workloads, and a decentralized canonical bridge moves BTC in and out. Wrapped BTC becomes the base asset powering swaps, lending, and yield strategies. For developers, SPL-compatible tokens and a Rust-based SDK make it relatively easy to port Solana-style applications into a Bitcoin-aligned environment. That combination of throughput and Bitcoin-native alignment is already drawing interest. The presale has raised over $28.5M so far at a token price of $0.013335, signaling that investors are positioning for an ecosystem build-out rather than a short-lived meme rotation. In our deeper coverage of what is $HYPER , we’ve already noted how the architecture sets it apart from typical Bitcoin-adjacent plays. Our latest Bitcoin Hyper price prediction models point to meaningful upside if transaction volume, staking participation, and developer migration land even modestly in line with expectations. Smart money is accumulating as well: two high-net-worth wallets added $396K in recent weeks, with the largest buy at $53K. After TGE, high-APY staking (40%), a seven-day vesting period for presale stakers, and rewards tied to governance and community engagement are slated to keep capital sticky as the network comes online. For those who believe Bitcoin eventually breaks out while congestion and programmability constraints persist, a scalable Layer 2 like Bitcoin Hyper offers a direct, higher-beta way to express that thesis.

    "title": "Pundit Shares XRP Fact That Will ‘Blow Your Mind’",
    "body": "A crypto analyst has made a bold statement about XRP’s current price behavior, arguing that the cryptocurrency’s slow movements are necessary to build strong support levels. The analyst highlights the importance of consolidation and long-term accumulation, suggesting that XRP’s support levels are laying the groundwork for a market reset and a significant price surge. The Mind-Blowing Truth About XRP On Wednesday, crypto market expert Diep Sanh took to X, announcing that he had a mind-blowing message to share with the crypto community. The analyst explained that XRP’s current price action is far more important than many investors realize. According to him, extended periods of consolidation, as XRP is currently experiencing, lay the foundation for major rallies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dead Cat Bounce: Analyst Reveals What To Expect As Price Recovers Sanh emphasized that when XRP spends a significant time near the $2 mark, it gives investors the chance to accumulate at that price. He explained that this accumulation builds a powerful layer of support, which can help stabilize the market during future corrections. He also noted that once XRP climbs to a higher region and stays there long enough to form a higher low, a new wave of investors usually enters. This creates the next support base and sets the stage for a major upward move. Sanh hinted that XRP could reach dramatic price targets, such as $10 or even $100. However, it would require several of these strong support layers to form over time. Each layer represents greater confidence in the asset and more liquidity to sustain a stronger market. The analyst noted that investors or traders who are frustrated by XRP’s low price and recent downturn are missing the bigger picture. He highlighted that they do not understand how these gradual accumulation phases work or how they can contribute to long-term gains. XRP Remains One Of The Best Crypto Plays After Price Dip In a subsequent analysis, Sanh reaffirmed his confidence in XRP’s future outlook following the recent market downturn. He noted that XRP remains one of the strongest crypto plays despite its recent price crash. The analyst emphasized that the cryptocurrency continues to stand out due to the utility of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a blockchain network engineered for fast and efficient global payments. Related Reading: XRP 100x Rally To $225: Why The Only Place To Go Is Up Sanh noted that this unique design of XRPL gives it an advantage over many large-cap competitors. Moreover, with regulatory uncertainty largely resolved after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dispute, the analyst highlights that XRP has already outperformed most top assets. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.2, experiencing a slight recovery despite recording weeks of choppy price action. Sanh disclosed that investors and traders tend to treat such corrections as strategic accumulation periods rather than signs of weakness. He argued that if XRP continues to expand in areas such as cross-border payments, tokenized asset markets, and stablecoin development, it would benefit its underlying structure. He added that these expanding sectors will also provide long-term support for the cryptocurrency’s growth potential. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin Falling Wedge Formation Says Expect 80-90% Rally In The Coming Days",
    "body": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is flashing a potential bullish reversal signal as a crypto analyst points to a breakout setup forming on the mid-term chart. The analyst’s chart highlights a tightening Falling Wedge on the 12-hour timeframe, signaling a possible shift in momentum after weeks of sustained decline. With price compressing toward the Falling Wedge’s apex, he has predicted that Dogecoin could soon see an explosive 80-80% price rally. Falling Wedge Pattern Points To Massive Dogecoin Breakout Crypto market expert Clifton Fx has released a new Dogecoin update on X, drawing attention to a clear Falling Wedge formation on the 12-hour chart. The chart shows that Dogecoin has been moving downward within the two converging trendlines of this wedge—a pattern that often precedes strong bull rallies. Usually, when a Falling Wedge appears, it indicates the end of a consolidation phase facilitated by a correction. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s 6,500% Surge: The Road That Leads From $0.15 To $10 This Cycle Dogecoin’s recent bounce from the wedge’s support suggests that the market may be preparing for a massive breakout. Building on this, Clifton Fx’s chart analysis shows that the wedge has reached a stage where volatility typically compresses before an expansion, making the next few sessions critical for a bullish confirmation. The expert’s analysis suggests that once the DOGE price breaks above the upper trendline of the Falling Wedge, the cryptocurrency could see a massive 80% to 90% bull rally in the days following the breakout. Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.15, reflecting the broader market downturn that has pushed the meme coin down by more than 23% in just over a month. If the price can initiate a rebound above 80%, it would erase the recent losses and also propel Dogecoin toward the $0.27 to $0.29 range. DOGE Cyclical Pattern Signals $5 Move By 2026 Sharing similar bullish sentiments about Dogecoin’s future, a pseudonymous crypto analyst, Bark, takes a broader view of the meme coin’s price behavior across multiple market cycles to decipher its next move. The accompanying chart maps out DOGE’s historical patterns since 2014, illustrating two major cycles characterized by extended accumulation phases and followed by explosive price surges. Related Reading: What Happens If Dogecoin Moves Out Of This Massive Wyckoff Accumulation? Each cycle was defined by similar chart structures, including a rounded base and consolidation zones that preceded each upward surge. According to Bark, Dogecoin appears to be replicating the fractal formation from past cycles. The first cycle in 2017 and the second in 2021 exhibited long accumulation periods before sharp vertical breakouts of about 5,858% and 21,457%, respectively. If the same historical pattern repeats in this cycle, Bark has predicted that Dogecoin could be setting the stage for a massive bull rally to $5 by 2026. The chart shows that a surge to this level from DOGE’s current price of $0.15 could represent a staggering 4,447% increase. Featured image from Peakpx, chart from Tradingview.com",

Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces More Downside After Recent Crash, Data Shows Reports show that about 45% of those deposits came in chunks of 100 BTC or more, and on one day large transfers reached 7,000 BTC. The average deposit size in November rose to 1.23 BTC, the largest monthly figure in a year. Those numbers point to more than casual rebalancing; they point to coins being moved where they can be sold. Binance Stablecoins Hit Record According to market coverage, Binance’s stablecoin holdings climbed to a record $51 billion. At the same time, BTC and Ether inflows to exchanges swelled to roughly $40 billion this week, with Binance and Coinbase leading the move. Traders often park funds in dollar-pegged tokens when they want to wait on the sidelines. That build-up means cash is available, but it is sitting idle until sellers either step back or buyers turn up again. Bitcoin exchange inflows are rising as the price drops to ~87K, a seven-month low. Large deposits (100+ BTC) now make up 45% of all inflows, hitting 7K BTC on Nov 21. Large holders are increasingly sending BTC to exchanges, reinforcing the current downtrend. pic.twitter.com/UpN4rAL0FH — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 26, 2025 Analysts Eye Further Pullback Some market watchers warn the recent recovery could be only a pause, flagging remaining margin positions and suggested a test of lower levels. They said a wick into the $70k–$80k zone would be one way to clear out the last pockets of exposure. 10x Research put resistance levels at $92,000 and $101,000 as the key ranges to watch during any rebound. For context, Bitcoin had clawed back above $90,000 and was trading slightly higher at the time of reporting, but it remains down about 28% from the all-time high north of $126,000 reached in October. Short-Term Bounce, Not A Full Recovery Meanwhile, market moves in stocks and crypto have shown mixed signals. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were pushing gains as investors bet on a US Fed rate cut, and that helped risk assets. Yet reports from strategists show the usual close link between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq has weakened, with Bitcoin’s decline steeper in recent weeks. Ether and many altcoins also faced higher exchange inflows, and several tokens returned to bear-market lows as selling pressure widened.

A meaningful rally will likely need either heavy buying demand or a clear catalyst that draws those stablecoins back into risk assets. For now, the market sits in a waiting mode: a short rally could continue, but a deeper dip remains possible as positions get cleared and sellers complete their rotations.

    "title": "Ethereum Is 58% ‘Undervalued’ Based On Intrinsic Metrics, Says Hashed CEO",
    "body": "Ethereum is trading far below its modeled “intrinsic value,” according to a live valuation dashboard launched by Hashed CEO Simon Kim. On ETHval (ethval.com), the current snapshot shows Ethereum at a spot price of $3,034.0 while the reliability-weighted “Composite Fair Value” stands at $4,777.5, implying +57.8% upside versus the market. The median fair value across models is $4,026.68, or +33.8% above spot. The dashboard labels ETH “UNDERVALUED” and aggregates its eight models into five buy, one hold and two sell signals. How The Fair Value Of Ethereum Is Calculated Kim introduced the project on X with the explicit goal of shifting the discussion away from pure sentiment: “What is ETH actually worth? The crypto industry deserves better than price speculation. I built a dashboard to think about ETH’s intrinsic value with 8 models… Far from perfect and open to feedback.” ETHval makes those models and their outputs fully visible, along with their individual reliability tags. Related Reading: Ethereum Price To Recover Or Crash? The Real ‘Leverage Point’ Investors Should Know About The tool’s central panel breaks out each valuation. The TVL Multiple model, which prices ETH off total value locked in DeFi using a 7× TVL-to-market-cap anchor, assigns a fair value of $4,026.6, judging ETH 32.7% undervalued (reliability: medium). A more conservative MC/TVL Fair Value mean-reversion model, treated as high reliability, lands at $3,453.1, only 13.8% above spot and classified as “fair.” Models that embed stronger network-effect or cash-flow claims are far more aggressive. The DCF (Staking) framework, which discounts an implied perpetual stream of staking rewards, values ETH at $9,101.9, indicating it is 200.0% undervalued. A high-reliability Metcalfe’s Law implementation, which scales value with TVL to the power of 1.5, is even more bullish at $9,585.9, or 216.8% above the current price. The Ethereum L2 ecosystem model, which adds twice the TVL of major rollups to Ethereum mainnet TVL before applying a multiple, generates a fair value of $4,640.0, implying 52.9% undervaluation, although ETHval marks this model’s reliability as low. A Staking Scarcity model, also low reliability and based on liquid-supply contraction, prices ETH at $3,538.2, or 16.6% undervalued. Related Reading: Ethereum Steadies Near $2,900 as Fed Rate-Cut Odds Fuel $3,400 Rebound Hopes Two income-style models push in the opposite direction and still receive high reliability scores. The P/E Ratio (25×) model treats annualized protocol fees as “earnings,” applies a 25× multiple and arrives at a fair value of only $957.4, reading ETH as 68.4% overvalued. The Revenue Yield model reverse-engineers price from a target protocol yield of 2.5%; at current revenue levels it outputs $1,531.8, implying 49.5% overvaluation. To synthesize these conflicting signals, ETHval applies a disclosed weighting scheme: high-reliability models are multiplied by 9, medium by 5 and low by 2 when computing the $4,780.7 composite. That weighting, combined with the extreme upside implied by the DCF and Metcalfe models, is what drives the overall conclusion that Ethereum is strongly undervalued despite two respected frameworks pointing to downside. The dashboard itself stops short of making investment recommendations. Underneath the numbers, ETHval reiterates that the outputs are for reference only and that each model rests on explicit, debatable assumptions. But by fixing the current ETH price at $3,034.0 against a live fair-value band stretching from $957.4 on the bearish end to $9,585.9 on the most bullish, Kim’s site quantifies a debate that usually plays out in anecdotes and narratives—and, for now, that quantified view leans clearly toward Ethereum being undervalued. At press time, ETH traded at $3,029. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Crypto analyst NeverWishing has predicted that the XRP price will rally to as high as $1,115. He highlighted three paths for XRP to reach this target, in what the analyst described as the final bull run for the altcoin. Analyst Maps Out Final XRP Bull Run Rally To $1,115 In a TradingView post, the crypto analyst mapped out three paths for XRP to rally to the $1,115 target. They tagged the first path as the immediate delivery, the second as a normal delivery, and the third as one that will trigger only if the XRP price stays suppressed. For the third path, NeverWishing stated that a final backup execution could happen between January 1 and 6 next year. Related Reading: The Bull And Bear Scenario For XRP That Could Play Out In November For path A, NeverWishing stated that it will start between this month and next month, with the first impulse sparking an XRP rally to between $30 and $33. The secondary spike will send the altcoin to $186, while a consolidation phase will lead to a climb toward $285. After that, XRP will rally to its final blow-off target of $1,115. NeverWishing described the second path as the fastest, stating it will occur between January and March next year. The first stop will be between $30 and $33 for XRP, after which volatility waves will occur through February and March. The altcoin will then break into the macro expansion zone, with the major target at $285 and the final target at $1,115. The Third Path For XRP The analyst noted that the third path is smoother and slightly delayed. NeverWishing also reiterated that this is a suppressed variant and will only happen if the first and second paths fail. They explained that if the XRP price stays held down, then the algorithm will reset and fire between January 1 and 6 next year. Related Reading: Why XRP Price Crash Below $2 Is Not A Problem – $20 Is Still The Target XRP will have the same opening move as the first two paths, rallying to between $30 and $33. It will then have the same structure as the second path, with the macro targets being $285 and $1,115. NeverWishing then outlined the key timing windows for XRP as it eyes a rally to this $1,115 target. The first key timing is between this month and January 2026, which marks the entry and breakout window. The analyst tagged March 21, 2026, as the mid-cycle reversal point in the XRP final bull run. August 14, 2026, marks the “warning zone,” while the pullback is expected between October and November 2026. Lastly, NeverWishing stated that January 1, 2027, is the final liquidity window. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.20, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

The proposed ETF would offer regulated exposure to Solana without requiring investors to hold the token directly, a move widely seen as a bullish catalyst for long-term adoption. Historically, ETFs have had mixed but notable effects on crypto markets. Bitcoin surged to new all-time highs after its ETF debut in 2024, while Ethereum took months to show similar momentum. Analysts say it remains unclear whether SOL will follow the Bitcoin pattern or display a more gradual response once the ETF is approved. SOL's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Upbit’s $37M Solana Hack Sends Shockwaves, But SOL Stays Steady Upbit confirmed an unauthorized outflow of roughly 54 billion KRW (about $37 million) involving SOL and several Solana-based tokens. The exchange immediately halted deposits and withdrawals, moved remaining assets into cold storage, and pledged to fully reimburse affected customers from its own reserves. While such incidents typically trigger steep price drops, Solana’s ecosystem demonstrated surprising stability. Not only did SOL hold above $140, a multi-month high-timeframe support zone, but Solana memecoins such as BONK, TRUMP, and MOODENG barely reacted. Traders pointed to on-chain data showing buyers aggressively defending key support levels, even as broader market sentiment wavered. Upbit has already frozen ₩12 billion worth of stolen LAYER tokens and is working with partners to trace additional assets. The timing of the breach, occurring nearly six years to the day after Upbit’s notorious 2019 hack, has drawn attention but has not shaken confidence in Solana’s network. Technical Outlook: Rebound or Breakdown? Analysts highlight $142–$145 as the immediate resistance band, supported by an estimated 13 million SOL accumulated at that level. A breakout could open the path toward $165, $188, and even higher liquidity pockets at $220–$240. Longer-term projections suggest potential targets between $360 and $480 if Wyckoff reaccumulation patterns complete. However, a failure to maintain $143 support could send SOL toward deeper zones at $130–$127. Related Reading: Has The Bitcoin Price Hit Its Bottom?

    "title": "Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Hit $100 Before Bitcoin Hits $1 Million",
    "body": "A crypto analyst has issued a decisive projection that challenges the long timelines often associated with major price milestones for Bitcoin. His outlook was presented in response to the ultra-bullish forecasts from Michael Saylor and Jack Mallers, who have spoken openly about the possibility of Bitcoin reaching between $1 million and $20 million per coin. Rather than focusing on Bitcoin’s distant targets, the analyst directed attention to XRP, insisting that XRP will reach $100 long before Bitcoin touches the seven-figure mark. Analyst Says XRP Will Reach $100 Before Bitcoin’s Million-Dollar Target There have been many bullish predictions of Bitcoin breaking above the $1 million mark in recent months, with notable names like Michael Saylor and Cathie Wood pointing to million-dollar targets. Related Reading: Analyst Claims XRP Will Flip Bitcoin As These Developments Play Out However, an analyst who goes by the name 24HRSCRYPTO on the social media platform X referenced Saylor and Mallers’ price prediction, which places future Bitcoin valuations in the tens of millions per coin and implies a market cap approaching $500 trillion. He contrasted those long-range projections with what he believes is a more attainable and nearer-term milestone for XRP. Punching in the numbers shows that XRP is a 4,445% move away from $100 based on its current price level of around $2.2. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is 990% away from the $1 million price. Even with that difference, the analyst noted, “You will see XRP at $100 before Bitcoin hits $1 million.” The statement points to the view that XRP is positioned for faster price growth in the foreseeable future, as seen by price dynamics in the past few months. The crypto is increasingly being positioned in a situation where demand and adoption of the Ripple ecosystem could take it to new heights. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s price action is slowing down relative to XRP. Notably, technical analysis of the XRP/BTC pair places XRP on the path to outperforming Bitcoin in the coming weeks and months. The Altcoin Will Hit $1,000 Before Bitcoin Touches $19 Million The analyst extended his projection even further by asserting that XRP could rally to $1,000 before Bitcoin comes close to the $19 million figure referenced by Saylor. Such a valuation for Bitcoin would imply a market capitalization of roughly $500 trillion, a scale far beyond anything seen in global financial history. Related Reading: Analyst Claims XRP Price Will Surge To $220 Due To ETFs, But Is This Possible? Measured from today’s levels, Bitcoin would need to climb roughly 20,635% to reach the $19 million mark. XRP’s path to $1,000 amounts to an even larger jump of about 45,300%, which corresponds to a market cap of $60 trillion based on its current circulating supply. Still, XRP reaching $1,000 is, in his view, more feasible than Bitcoin reaching millions per coin. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New ‘Line In The Sand’ May Be $82,000, Not $56,000: Analyst This convergence of regulatory momentum, institutional adoption, and renewed technical strength has positioned AVAX for a potential market revival heading into 2026. AVAX's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: AVAXUSD on Tradingview Securitize Wins EU Approval and Selects Avalanche for Settlement System Securitize received regulatory authorization from Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) to operate a tokenized trading and settlement system under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime. The approval enables Securitize to passport the license across the European Single Market, including France, Germany, and Italy, creating an unprecedented bridge between its U.S. broker-dealer operations and Europe’s capital markets. The firm confirmed that the entire infrastructure will run on the Avalanche blockchain, citing sub-second finality, regulatory-grade network performance, and scalable architecture. This move positions Avalanche at the center of institutional tokenization just as Securitize prepares for a $1.25 billion SPAC merger and expands its portfolio, including managing the now-over $1 billion BlackRock BUIDL on-chain treasury fund. The first EU-compliant issuance is slated for early 2026, opening the door for a wave of regulated tokenized assets, an estimated $18 trillion market by 2033. AVAX Price Holds Key Support as Technical Signals Improve While fundamentals surge, AVAX’s price remains compressed near the long-term support zone around $12–$15. The token recently bounced to $14.94, posting a 6.5% daily gain and breaking above its 7-day moving average at $13.96. It now faces a technical showdown with resistance at the 20-day SMA at $15.21. Momentum indicators are turning constructive. RSI sits at a healthy 42, MACD shows bullish divergence, and Stochastic momentum favors buyers. A breakout above $15.21 could open the path toward $18.61, with a larger target near $33 if long-term trendlines snap. However, failure to hold above $13.91 risks retesting deeper support near $12.57. Institutional Accumulation Strengthens Bullish Outlook Fueling optimism, AVAX One Treasury recently accumulated over 9.37 million AVAX, spending $110 million between November 5 and 23. Total reserves now exceed 13.8 million AVAX, signaling robust long-term institutional confidence. On-chain metrics support the bullish case. Deployed contracts are rising, developer activity is expanding, and futures taker data shows increasing buyer dominance. These combined forces suggest that AVAX may be carving out a medium-term bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Climbs Back To $91,000: Is The Decline Over?

    "body": "Bolivia has moved to bring stablecoins into its formal banking system, a shift that could change how people save and pay for things in the country. Banks will be allowed to offer accounts, custody and payment services tied to stablecoins such as USDT, government statements and local reports disclosed. The move follows a sharp rise in crypto use as people seek ways to hold dollar-pegged value amid currency pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces More Downside After Recent Crash, Data Shows Banks To Offer USDT Accounts Reports have disclosed that Economy Minister Jose Gabriel Espinoza announced the change, and at least one lender, Banco Bisa, has already begun offering custody and transfer services for USDT. Based on reports, crypto transactions in Bolivia jumped dramatically last year, with some counts showing growth of more than 500% and figures putting crypto activity at $294 million in the first half of 2025. Those numbers have pushed regulators and banks to respond more directly. 💥 BREAKING: 🇧🇴 Bolivia to integrate Bitcoin and crypto into its financial system, starting with stablecoins pic.twitter.com/Qb0Tj7pern — Bitcoin Archive (@BitcoinArchive) November 26, 2025 Everyday Payments And Savings People and businesses are reportedly testing USDT for real payments. Some shops and service providers have shown prices in USDT, and certain sectors — such as car dealers and firms handling imports — are said to be accepting stablecoin payments for some transactions. According to market observers, the change is partly a response to shortages of physical US dollars and to rising costs that make the local currency less stable for saving. Banks will be able to create savings products denominated in stablecoins, and may offer loans or payment options tied to them. Cross-Border Transfers And Remittances Based on reports, one obvious use will be cross-border transfers. Stablecoins can offer a dollar-pegged option when access to actual US dollars is limited. That could help businesses that buy fuel or other imports and families that receive money from abroad. Still, practical hurdles remain: many people are unbanked or lack easy internet access, and broad adoption will take infrastructure, training and clear consumer protections. Regulatory Limits And Risks According to analysts, the government’s plan does not make stablecoins legal tender in place of the boliviano. Rather, it lets regulated banks provide crypto-linked services under the financial system. That means accepting USDT will likely stay voluntary for merchants. There are also risks to watch: stablecoin liquidity, custody safety, and how well banks manage anti-money-laundering rules. Consumer education and stronger oversight will be needed to protect ordinary users. What Comes Next Several months of rollout and pilot programs are expected, and observers will be watching transaction volumes and how many banks and businesses sign on. If the system grows, Bolivia could become an example for neighboring countries facing similar currency stress. But the deeper economic problems that pushed people to crypto — inflation and limited dollar access — will still need government solutions beyond new payment rails.

Got zeroed.” Scaramucci framed the last 20 trading days as another brutal reminder of crypto’s structural volatility. “I know I have a trap door on my portfolio,” he said. “Once in a while I’ll be walking across the living room feeling beautiful about myself. And then, boom, a trap door opens and I have fallen into the basement of the house.” Related Reading: Will Crypto Explode If Kevin Hassett Takes Over The Fed In 2026? According to Novogratz, this particular trap door opened at Binance. “It started really by, you know, at Binance, they had an oracle which set price misfunction,” he said. That error hit a synthetic stablecoin and “created a cascade where people were getting stopped out because there was the wrong price.” The dislocation then bled into levered perpetual markets “like Hyperliquid, like Uniswap,” where “as prices went down, people started getting liquidated.” He argued that the way crypto participants use leverage turned a technical glitch into a systemic event. “What people don’t understand about crypto is that the crypto investor doesn’t play for 10, 11, 12 percent returns,” he said. “Crypto investor call themselves degens with pride. They want to turn one into 15. And so they trade a very volatile asset with a lot of leverage.” Perpetual futures make that leverage particularly dangerous for liquidity providers. “Perpetual futures are not normal futures,” Novogratz said, crediting “the genius that Arthur Hayes and his group of people” for a design where “as longs get liquidated, they’re paired off against shorts.” In a fast collapse, “you could be short and you lose your short position. Well, if you’re long on another exchange against that short position, you’re shit out of luck. And that happened to a lot of market makers.” Will The Crypto Market Recover? The result, he said, was a sharp loss of liquidity and retail capital. “We lost a lot of liquidity in the market. We lost a lot of retail punters who lost their stack,” he noted, adding that after such a wipeout “it takes a while for Humpty Dumpty to get put back together again.” Novogratz said he initially expected higher levels to hold. “I actually, to be fair, thought we were going to hold at higher levels at $90,000,” he admitted. “And we went all the way to $80,000. $80,000 was a maximum pain point… Got to $1.80 on XRP. We got to $125 on Solana. Real pain points.” He links the subsequent rebound to macro tailwinds, not healed sentiment. “Now we bounce up. We bounce because of the Fed. But we’re not out of the woods,” he said. “I do think Bitcoin will climb back towards $100,000 by the end of the year, but there’ll be sellers waiting there. We’ve done some medium-term damage to the psychology of the market.” Related Reading: Crypto Has Entered Late-Cycle Territory, Says Global Liquidity Veteran On the spot side, he highlighted massive profit-taking by early holders against ETF-driven inflows. “We had one $9 billion seller,” he said. “That’s one-third of all of IBIT’s flows of the year.” As US wealth channels move “from a zero weighting to a 3 to 4 percent weighting” in Bitcoin, that “was met with OG sellers.” “In the long run, that’s healthy,” he said. “In the short run, that’s painful.” Novogratz also argued that crypto is being repriced as a real business ecosystem rather than a pure story. “It’s a transition from just being a story — ‘we’re the most important industry… we’re going to decentralize the world’ — to ‘show me what crypto actually does,’” he said. “Some businesses are making money. Some businesses aren’t. There are some token ecosystems that make common sense to an investor and there’s some that all feel like they’re just an association.” Overlaying it all is a macro backdrop he views as increasingly supportive. He called the Fed’s recent signals and plans to ease bank cash requirements in repo “a monstrous liquidity boom that’s coming,” adding that “they’re going to bring rates down to 2 percent in the next 16 months” and that inflation will “creep higher,” implying negative real rates. For crypto, the message is double-edged: structurally de-levered, with fewer market makers and wounded sentiment, but still tied to a global liquidity cycle that Novogratz believes is turning in its favor — once Humpty Dumpty gets put back together again. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,115. Featured image from YouTube, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Could Be At Risk Of A Deeper Bear If This Ratio Compresses, Says Glassnode",
    "body": "On-chain analytics firm Glassnode has revealed in a report how long-term Bitcoin liquidity has witnessed a sharp decline alongside the market downturn. Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Liquidity Ratio Has Plunged Recently In its latest weekly report, Glassnode has talked about how liquidity in the Bitcoin market has changed following the recent downturn. Glassnode has gauged the “liquidity” using the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio, an on-chain metric that measures the ratio between the profit and loss that BTC investors are realizing through their transactions. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New ‘Line In The Sand’ May Be $82,000, Not $56,000: Analyst Current demand momentum can be tracked using a version of this indicator that specifically tracks the profitability of the short-term holders (STHs), investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. As the below chart shows, the STH Realized Profit/Loss Ratio was at relatively high levels earlier, but since early October, its value has plummeted. With a value of just 0.07, the indicator is now sitting deep inside the loss region, a sign that the recent Bitcoin buyers have overwhelmingly been capitulating at a loss. “Such overwhelming loss dominance confirms that liquidity has evaporated, especially after the heavy demand absorption seen in Q2–Q3 2025 as long-term holders increased their spending,” explained the analytics firm. The metric fell to similar lows back in Q1 2022, but so far, market weakness hasn’t been as prolonged. The report noted that if the ratio continues to be depressed, market conditions could mirror those from back then. While short-term demand momentum has collapsed, the same hasn’t been true for long-term liquidity, at least not yet. Long-term momentum can be measured using the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio of the long-term holders (LTHs), representing the more resolute section of the market (holding time greater than 155 days). From the above chart, it’s visible that the 7-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the Bitcoin LTH Realized Profit/Loss Ratio has witnessed a sharp decline as BTC has crashed. Despite the drop, however, the metric’s value is still 408, implying LTHs are realizing, on average, a profit that’s 408 times the loss. This means that the long-term liquidity is still healthy compared to Q1 2022, or even the major bottom formations from the current cycle. Glassnode warned, however, “if liquidity continues to fade and this ratio compresses toward 10x or lower, the probability of transitioning into a deeper bear market becomes difficult to ignore.” Related Reading: XRP Rebounds From Channel Bottom, Analyst Says $2.60 Could Be Next It now remains to be seen how the LTH Realized Profit/Loss will change for Bitcoin in the near future, and if liquidity will see a further squeeze.

The pair could continue to move up if it settles above the $3,080 zone. Ethereum Price Eyes More Gains Ethereum price managed to stay above $2,880 and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to climb above the $2,920 and $2,950 levels. The bulls were able to push the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,165 swing high to the $2,620 low. The bulls even pumped the price above $3,000 but they struggled to clear the $3,080 zone.

A clear move above the $3,120 resistance might send the price toward the $3,165 resistance. An upside break above the $3,165 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,220 resistance zone or even $3,250 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH?

    "body": "Thailand has officially adopted a new tax-rule giving a 0% personal income tax rate on capital gains from cryptocurrency trades — but only under certain conditions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces More Downside After Recent Crash, Data Shows According to regulation Ministerial Regulation No. 399 (MR 399), profits earned from selling or transferring cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin via exchanges, brokers, or dealers licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand (SEC) will be tax-free from January 1, 2025 until December 31, 2029. What The 0% Tax Means Under the new scheme, individual investors who trade crypto through SEC-licensed platforms don’t pay personal income tax on any gains. The exemption applies only if the trade is done on a local approved exchange, broker, or dealer. FACT: THAILAND NOW OFFERS 0% CAPITAL GAINS TAX ON #BITCOIN TRADED ON NATIONAL EXCHANGES GLOBAL GAME THEORY AT WORK ✨ pic.twitter.com/8rf21xJxKT — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) November 26, 2025 Regular income tax rules apply to the same type of income for taxpayers who participate in foreign/unlicensed exchange activity, as well as those who generate crypto income from mining, staking and/or airdrops. The publication of this regulation in the Royal Gazette on September 5th 2025 makes it official and enforceable by law. Reaction to this regulation was also positive from both officials and investors: an official statement indicates the primary purpose of creating this regulation was to provide incentives for current and future traders to use local regulated exchanges as opposed to using foreign/unregulated exchanges. They hope this will strengthen Thailand’s financial system and bring more transparency into crypto trades. Some analysts expect the policy to draw both local and international interest in Thailand’s licensed exchanges. The government seems to try making its digital-asset sector more competitive while ensuring regulatory compliance. What Investors Should Know To benefit from 0% tax, trades must go through valid, licensed channels. Gains from outside platforms or unapproved services don’t qualify. Accurate records of purchase and sale, including dates and exchange receipts, are vital to prove eligibility if asked by tax authorities. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Reenters ETH Market, Fires Off A $44-M Long The exemption runs only until December 31, 2029. After that date, the law will need review or renewal. So traders thinking long-term should consider what might happen after 2029. This policy shift represents a significant signal from Bangkok to both domestic and global crypto players. It makes compliant crypto trading cheaper — maybe more attractive — while drawing a clearer line between regulated and unregulated channels. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Bullish Rebound Sparks Path Toward The $98,000 Imbalance Zone",
    "body": "Bitcoin is showing new signs of strength after its sharp decline, with buyers stepping back in and momentum shifting upward. With price reclaiming key support levels, the path toward the major $98,000 imbalance zone is now back on the table, but bulls still need to prove this rebound has real conviction. FVG Filled, Bearish OB Tagged — What Comes After The Perfect Hit? Crypto analyst Crypto Patel, in a recent market update, noted that Bitcoin has now completed a key technical move by filling the Fair Value Gap (FVG) and tapping directly into the Bearish Order Block exactly as previously projected. He emphasized that traders who avoided shorting the $81,000–$85,000 region and instead positioned for the upside likely captured a clean and predictable long setup. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New ‘Line In The Sand’ May Be $82,000, Not $56,000: Analyst With that phase now complete, the focus shifts to Bitcoin’s next major target. Patel highlights the $96,800–$98,000 FVG as the upcoming high-timeframe imbalance zone. From a broader perspective, Patel still expects Bitcoin to make a move toward the $98,000 zone before any significant corrective leg unfolds. This aligns with his macro outlook, which continues to favor a final upward sweep into that region before momentum weakens again. However, he also outlines a clear invalidation point for the bearish bias. A sustained high-timeframe close above $107,550 would negate the existing bearish market structure entirely. Such a breakout would signal the start of a new bullish phase for Bitcoin, potentially setting the stage for a fresh all-time-high trend. Promising Bounce As BTC Defends the $90,000 Support Zone According to The Boss, Bitcoin’s latest price action is showing early signs of strength. After the sharp decline, BTC reacted firmly at the local support and managed to push back above the $90,000 level, indicating that buyers are stepping in with renewed confidence. The chart now reflects a stable support zone that has held up against downward pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Market Confirmed? Expert Predicts Price Target Of $40,000 By Late 2026 Part of this rebound appears to be driven by improving macro sentiment. Softer expectations around Federal Reserve tightening, a rise in overall risk appetite, and a shift back toward risk-on assets are all contributing to Bitcoin’s recovery attempt. From a technical perspective, The Boss notes that Bitcoin must continue to hold above the $90,000–$91,000 range to form a meaningful upward wave from this base. However, caution is still warranted. Without clear confirmation from momentum indicators and sustained trading volume, the current move has the potential to be limited. The possibility of a dead-cat bounce remains on the table, especially following such an aggressive sell-off. Featured image from Pngtree, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Puell Multiple Plunges, But Not Inside Bottom Zone Yet",
    "body": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Puell Multiple has gone through a decline recently, a sign that miner revenue has gone down relative to its baseline. Bitcoin Puell Multiple Has Dropped To 0.67 In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Puell Multiple. The “Puell Multiple” refers to a popular on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the daily BTC mining revenue (in USD) and 365-day moving average (MA) of the same. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Be At Risk Of A Deeper Bear If This Ratio Compresses, Says Glassnode Miners earn their income through two sources: block subsidy and transaction fees. In the context of the metric, however, only the former part of their revenue is relevant. Block subsidy is a fixed BTC-denominated reward that miners receive when they add the next block to the chain. Usually, it makes up for the dominant and stable part of miner income. When the value of the Puell Multiple is greater than 1, it means that the network validators are earning a higher revenue from block subsidy than the average for the past year. On the other hand, the metric being under the mark implies miners are making less than usual. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Puell Multiple over the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Puell Multiple has witnessed a rapid decline recently that has taken its value below the 1 level. This drop in the metric is a result of the bearish price action that the cryptocurrency has faced. The block subsidy is fixed in BTC value and is more-or-less also fixed in rate of time, so the daily BTC income from it is about constant for miners. The USD value of the reward, however, is dependent on the asset’s spot price, which is indeed variable. The earlier bull run resulted in the Puell Multiple rising above the 1 mark as miner revenue from block subsidy surged. Similarly, the market downturn has led to a decline in the USD miner income. Today, the metric’s value is 0.67, meaning that the chain validators are making just 67% of the average revenue from the last 365 days. Historically, miners being under a high amount of pressure has made bottoms more probable for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New ‘Line In The Sand’ May Be $82,000, Not $56,000: Analyst As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, the major bottoms since 2015 have generally formed when the Puell Multiple has dipped below 0.50. If the current cycle is also going to follow a similar pattern, then miner pain may not be enough for a bottom yet. BTC Price The latest rebound in the Bitcoin price has sustained for now as its price is still trading around $91,600. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com",

HYPE Poised For A New Rebound Market analyst OxMakeSense has highlighted the potential roadmap for HYPE to reach $50 in the short term, just below all-time high levels of $59, indicating that the token is starting to show the first signs of a significant shift. He emphasizes that the upcoming levels are filled with untouched liquidity, which could facilitate a climb for HYPE. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Climbs Back To $91,000: Is The Decline Over?

OxMakeSense identifies a crucial checkpoint for Hyperliquid in the $37–$38 price range, marking where the last breakdown occurred. If HYPE can reclaim this level, he suggested that it could lead to a squeeze of “trapped sellers.” Additionally, surpassing the $38 threshold would open up the chart for a direct move toward the $41–$42 range, an area described as “thin” with little major resistance left from prior sell-offs. Analyst Warns Of Potential Retracement To $25 In his social media analysis, OxMakeSense noted that the momentum pivot sits at a significant level of $44. He stated that strong trends typically begin by reclaiming mid-range levels like this one. Should HYPE flip this resistance into support, it is expected to accelerate further. Above $44, HYPE would enter a clearer trajectory, with targets aligning at $48 and ultimately at $50, where a substantial amount of untouched liquidity resides.

Fellow analyst Crypto TXG has expressed concerns regarding HYPE’s recent performance, pointing out that it lost the $35.8 level and found a temporary bottom near $28.5. While HYPE has reversed the trend, it is currently testing the $35.8 mark from below, which acts as a barrier. If HYPE can break through this resistance, the next target would be $42.3. Conversely, if it fails at $35.8, another pullback could occur, potentially retesting the $28.5 support more decisively. Adding to the cautious sentiment, market expert Ali Martinez has indicated that if the token retests the breakdown zone, there is a possibility it could revisit the $25 mark. This suggests that, despite the recent uptick, a short-term retracement of approximately 28% could be on the horizon. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Best Wallet Token’s Presale Ends in 3 Hours: Last Chance to Buy Before Listing",
    "body": "What to Know: Current wallets often force a trade‑off between centralized risk, clunky UX, and minimal user benefits, leaving mainstream crypto users underserved. Fragmented multichain activity and chaotic presale access highlight the need for a unified, mobile‑first wallet hub with built‑in economic incentives. Best Wallet Token builds a Fireblocks‑powered, non‑custodial wallet with multichain DEX aggregation and curated presale access through its Upcoming Tokens portal. $BEST underpins reduced fees, staking rewards, and higher APY opportunities, aligning user growth with token demand as Best Wallet targets mass adoption. Crypto has quietly shifted back into ‘build and buy infrastructure’ mode. Traders aren’t just chasing memecoins anymore – they’re hunting tools that actually make Web3 usable: safer wallets, better UX, and lower friction for multichain swaps and presales. Wallets sit at the center of that stack, but most haven’t evolved in years. You still juggle browser extensions, clunky mobile apps, and centralized providers that can freeze you out or blow up overnight. On the other hand, hardcore non-custodial wallets often feel hostile to newcomers, with confusing approvals, no real benefits for loyal users, and little support for cross-chain flows. That gap is where Best Wallet is trying to plant its flag. It positions itself as ‘The Next Gen Crypto Wallet,’ aiming to merge institutional-grade security, clean mobile UX, and actual economic perks for holders. And Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the official token of this ecosystem. With 1 $BEST still priced at $0.026015 in presale and the raise already above $18.1M, the market has effectively pre‑voted on the thesis before any exchange listing. You can read our analysis of Best Wallet Token for more context. Best Wallet Builds A Mobile-First, Benefit-Driven Web3 Hub Best Wallet is designed as a mobile-first, non‑custodial wallet that tries to feel like a fintech app, not a developer tool. You get an intuitive interface, no KYC, and support for thousands of assets across 6+ chains, while still retaining self-custody of your keys and funds at every step. Under the hood, it’s the first fully integrated Fireblocks MPC‑CMP wallet in this segment, combining advanced key management with custom multi-wallet portfolios for more sophisticated users. An Upcoming Tokens portal curates the best crypto presales , giving you simplified access to vetted early‑stage opportunities instead of trawling Telegram threads or DEX listings alone. For trading, the Best DEX aggregator is powered by Rubic, routing orders across 50+ chains, 330+ DEXs, and 30 cross‑chain bridges to seek competitive pricing and fewer failed swaps. And what powers all of this is the wallet’s official token, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – here’s how to buy $BEST now and join the presale. How High Could $BEST Go If Adoption Lands? If Best Wallet captures 5% of the global crypto wallet market, $BEST could reach a speculative $0.05106175 by the end of 2026, delivering roughly 97% returns from the current presale price of $0.026015. Read our $BEST price prediction to see why this estimation is within reason. Token utility is designed to reinforce that adoption loop. An 8% allocation – 800M $BEST – is reserved for staking rewards via a dynamic pool where your yield scales with your share of total staked tokens. Crucially, staking is available during presale, giving early participants a way to put idle allocations to work immediately. On top of that, $BEST holders are set to receive reduced fees across the Best Wallet ecosystem, higher APY options in the staking aggregator, and access to exclusive presales and iGaming partnerships through the Upcoming Tokens portal. If those perks pull users away from older wallets, the upside case becomes less theoretical and more realistic and promising. Best Wallet’s pitch is simple: combine institutional‑grade security, a mainstream‑ready mobile experience, deep multichain connectivity, and actual token‑holder benefits into a single app. With the presale still at $0.026015 and over $18.1M already raised, the project is trying to lock in a user base before the next wave of wallet competition hits. Whales have bought over $155K yesterday and today ($84.5K here , $59.3K here , and $12k here ). If you think the next cycle rewards usable infrastructure over pure speculation, $BEST is positioned as a leveraged bet on that thesis. You’re not just backing a token – you’re backing a wallet that aims to be the first screen every new crypto user opens. Join the $BEST presale before it ends in under 3 hours.

    "title": "Solana Reclaims Crucial Resistance Despite First SOL ETF Outflows – 25% Rally Ahead?",
    "body": "As the crypto market rebounds from the recent lows, Solana (SOL) has reclaimed a crucial level, nearing a key resistance area that could set the stage for a long-awaited price recovery rally, according to some market watchers. Related Reading: Ethereum’s End-Of-Year Rally Still At Play? Analysts Eye 50% December Jump Solana Bounces Despite ETF Outflows The crypto market has surged above the $3 trillion mark for the first time in a week, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most leading cryptocurrencies reclaiming crucial support levels lost during the latest market pullback. Solana joined the market rally and jumped from the recently recovered $135-$140 area to the upper zone of its local range on Wednesday afternoon. Notably, the altcoin has been trading between the $130-$145 price range over the past two weeks, briefly losing the lower boundary during last week’s correction. This week, SOL’s price has reclaimed some crucial ground, surging over 10% since Monday’s opening and nearing the $145 resistance. Amid this performance, analyst Ted Pillows noted institutional participation, as SOL treasury companies have started to show early signs of recovery. He also highlighted that Solana Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have experienced record inflows this month despite the correction. According to Farside Investors’ data, the SOL-based investment products have registered $613 million in inflows since their launch on October 28. It’s worth noting that throughout the recent pullbacks, Solana funds have seen a strong demand, with a 22-day positive streak while the altcoin’s price descended to multi-month lows. However, as its price recovered, SOL’s ETFs registered their first negative in nearly a month. 21Shares’ TSOL, which launched a week ago, saw $34 million in outflows on Wednesday, outshining the over $13 million and $10 million in inflows of Bitwise’s BSOL and Grayscale’s GSOL. As a result, the whole category recorded net outflows of $8.1 million. In his analysis, Ted Pillows also noted that “It seems like SOL has bottomed for a while, but institutional buying needs to accelerate here. Otherwise, it won’t take long for Solana to make new lows.” SOL Ready For December Recovery? Analyst Ali Martinez suggested that Solana’s pain might be over as its price “usually bottoms when investors capitulate… And for the past two weeks, that’s exactly what’s been happening.” According to the chart, SOL’s price has historically found a floor when the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) indicator reaches the capitulation zone, which it has recently fallen to. Meanwhile, Crypto Patel highlighted that Solana is breaking out of a one-month downtrend, which could trigger a 25% recovery rally near the key $180 barrier in the coming weeks. Another market observer warned that the altcoin is “walking straight into the lion’s den” as its price nears the $144-$146 resistance levels. Trader Mr. Ape noted that Solana’s price has been rejected three times from this heavy supply area, and momentum “is slowing again as we hit the zone.” Related Reading: XRP ETFs Outshine BTC, ETH, And SOL Funds With $164M Single-Day Inflows To the trader, this is the crucial level to watch, as another rejection could send the price to the $132 support, where strong demand lies from the previous bounce. On the contrary, a successful breakout from this level and reclaiming it as support could confirm the shift and trigger a surge to the $157 area. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $142, a 7.7% increase on the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",
