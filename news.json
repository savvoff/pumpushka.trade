    "title": "‘I Buy XRP From Now On,’ Says World’s Highest-IQ Claimant",
    "body": "Young Hoon Kim — the social-media personality who styles himself as the “IQ 276” record holder — just gave the XRP crowd a fresh piece of rocket fuel. “I buy XRP from now on,” Kim wrote on X on Friday, in what appears to be his first straight-up XRP shoutout after days of near-constant Bitcoin evangelizing. I buy #XRP from now on. — YoungHoon Kim, IQ 276 (@yhbryankimiq) December 12, 2025 Why The XRP Endorsement Now? And, yeah, the XRP Army did what it always does: it treated the post like a mini event. “The smartest man in the world is buying XRP,” one account, Gordon (@GordonGekko), replied — then immediately stapled the other big narrative of the day onto it: “XRP is now on Solana too. Is this the start of an XRP rally?” That second line isn’t just vibes. Solana’s official account posted “BREAKING: XRP is coming to Solana,” pointing to a wrapped-asset setup that would let XRP trade and move inside Solana DeFi rails. Hex Trust, which is positioning itself as issuer/custodian for the wrapped token (wXRP), says the product is designed to be 1:1 backed and redeemable for native XRP, using LayerZero’s OFT standard and launching “starting with Solana” (with more chains name-checked). Related Reading: Why This Market Analyst Is Warning Crypto Investors To Stop Buying XRP So Kim’s timing, intentional or not, landed right on top of a very convenient distribution channel: “XRP, but DeFi-ready.” If you’re an XRP holder who’s been watching Solana soak up memecoin liquidity and on-chain volume for the past year, that’s an easy story to forward to your group chat. The funny part is Kim’s recent persona has leaned hard into Bitcoin-maxi prophecy. In the last week alone, he made dozens of Bitcoin posts via X. On December 7, he posted: “In my personal view, Bitcoin’s current price is just a temporary discount caused by what seems to be market manipulation. I think any such manipulation may disappear within a week, and then it could start accelerating toward a new ATH.” Just a few days later, on December 10, he wrote: “My analysis suggests that Bitcoin may have set its bottom a few weeks ago, and we could now be entering a true supercycle.” One day later, he added: “”My analysis suggests that Bitcoin reaching 300K in early 2026 is a logical scenario.” Related Reading: XRP Forecast Turns Explosive As Canadian Experts Highlight Massive FinTech Utility Yesterday, Kim posted: “Bitcoin looks ready to break every prediction ever written. The real bull run begins when people think it’s already over,” before adding today: “I think Bitcoin is the money of God” and “In my view, one of the fastest ways to get rich is to stack Bitcoin.” So why the sudden XRP detour? No explanation yet, at least publicly. There’s also the reality that Kim is, politely put, controversial. Korean coverage has described him as being reported as an “IQ 276” holder tied to mind-sports organizations, but the broader profile has drawn scrutiny and debate online, with questions about verifiability and sourcing trailing the “world’s highest IQ” framing. Still, crypto doesn’t really wait for footnotes. A big claim, a big ticker, a hot comment section — and now an XRP-to-Solana headline to glue it together. That’s plenty for a one-day narrative. At press time, XRP traded at $2.04. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Solana Gains Institutional Momentum as New On-Chain Bond Deal and XRP Integration Build Hype",
    "body": "Solana (SOL) is gradually entering a new phase of institutional visibility as recent developments in tokenized finance and cross-chain asset integration draw increasing attention to the network. Related Reading: What’s Happening With The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Recently? From a high-profile commercial paper issuance to plans for bringing XRP onto Solana, the blockchain is positioning itself at the center of experiments that could reshape how digital assets interact with traditional markets. SOL's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Institutional Activity Accelerates With New Tokenized Bond Deal J.P. Morgan’s arrangement of a $50 million tokenized commercial paper issuance for Galaxy Digital marks one of the clearest signals yet that major financial institutions are warming to public blockchain infrastructure. The short-term debt instrument was issued on Solana, with Coinbase and Franklin Templeton purchasing the tokenized asset, and settlement conducted in USDC. The bank created the on-chain token representing the bond and handled primary settlement, positioning the project as a practical test of how public networks could support regulated financial transactions. The move shows Solana’s growing role in real-world asset tokenization, a sector projected by industry analysts to reach trillions of dollars over the next decade. For Solana, the deal is also a strategic validation. While the chain is widely known for retail and developer activity, institutional adoption has historically been slower to materialize. Seeing a large financial institution test a foundational market instrument on Solana offers a clearer path to deeper enterprise use cases. Solana – XRP Integration Signals Cross-Chain Expansion Alongside the bond issuance, Solana is preparing for the arrival of XRP through a partnership with Hex Trust and LayerZero, which will issue wrapped XRP (wXRP) on the network. The integration aims to extend XRP’s liquidity and utility into Solana’s fast-moving DeFi environment, enabling lending, liquidity provision, and other decentralized applications. Hex Trust confirmed that wXRP will be fully backed 1:1 with native XRP held in segregated custody accounts, supported by more than $100 million in initial liquidity. The addition may also influence XRP’s market structure, as wrapped supply requires native XRP to be locked, potentially tightening liquidity during high-demand periods. For Solana, the asset brings an established user base and deeper liquidity pools. For XRP, the move broadens its utility across high-performance decentralized markets that prioritize low-cost transactions and throughput. A Broader Shift in Market Perception These developments come as industry figures, such as Anthony Scaramucci, publicly reiterate their bullish outlook on Solana, arguing that the network’s growth trajectory could surpass Ethereum’s in market capitalization. While the claim remains speculative, the combination of institutional pilots, cross-chain integrations, and expanding developer activity suggests Solana is strengthening its position as a platform for both consumer and enterprise-grade applications.

    "title": "Dogecoin Tightens Up: Symmetrical Triangle Converges With High-Timeframe Wyckoff Setup",
    "body": "Dogecoin is entering a pivotal phase as its price action tightens within a symmetrical triangle, aligning with a high-timeframe Wyckoff setup. The combination of higher lows, compressed structure, and developing Wyckoff signals suggests growing strength beneath the surface, raising the possibility that DOGE is quietly preparing for its next major move. MTF Range Strategy: Longs At Discount, Shorts At Premium According to an update by Wyckoff Insider via the lens of a multi-timeframe (MTF) range, the focus is on seeking long positions in areas of extreme discount and short positions in areas of extreme premium. When an MTF range is present, it often develops a Wyckoff structure near both the range highs and lows, providing clearer points of interest for traders. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds Dogecoin is currently forming an 8H Bojan pivot in the extreme discount zone of this MTF range. The key to trading a Bojan pivot is identifying the Sign of Strength (SOS) that forms on the third candle. Bitcoin displayed a similar 8H Bojan recently, but trading it was more challenging due to deviations on both sides of the range, making DOGE difficult to trade also. On the lower timeframes, Dogecoin is also showing a Wyckoff Model 1 range. When the third candle opens, and price pulls down, traders look for an LPS, BOS, and internal BOS pattern. Valid entries include taking the breakout on the 3-minute BOS with a stop below the M1 low, or entering on the LPS after the internal BOS, with a stop placed beneath the LPS itself. In terms of trade management, Wyckoff Insider outlines a clear plan: risk should be kept at 2% per setup, with TP1 at the Wyckoff target zone (40%), and TP2 at the first range supply, fully closing the trade once a Sign of Weakness (SOW) appears. This structured approach helps navigate DOGE’s multi-layered Wyckoff-driven price action with discipline and clarity. Daily Structure Shows Strength Despite Downtrend Trader Tardigrade revealed that the daily chart provides clear indications that Dogecoin is actively building a stronger market structure despite the recent overall downtrend. This strength is apparent when comparing the current price action to past cycles. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Volatility Returns as Market Weighs Bullish Indicators Against Recent Dip Historically, when the broader market is weak, DOGE typically reinforces its bearish trend by forming lower lows following a distinct new swing low. However, in a significant departure from this pattern, DOGE is now attempting to establish a higher lows structure within a symmetrical triangle pattern. This formation is key, as the analyst suggests the symmetrical triangle structure indicates that Dogecoin has been rejected from trading further downward. Such a development signals that selling exhaustion is setting in, preparing the market for a potential directional breakout. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "XRP Whale Activity Spikes At The Bottom – A Classic Pre-Rally Signal",
    "body": "XRP has been under clear pressure in recent sessions, sliding toward its lowest price of the year as the broader crypto market continues to absorb heavy selling. Sentiment remains fragile, and many traders have shifted into defensive positioning while awaiting clearer macro signals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Refuse to Sell: Historic Signal Emerges As Binance CDD Drops To 2017 Levels According to a new report from CryptoQuant, however, the underlying picture is more complex than the price chart suggests. Despite the short-term decline, XRP whales are becoming increasingly active, showing no hesitation in trading and accumulating even as retail participation weakens. This divergence between whale behavior and market sentiment is noteworthy. Historically, XRP’s most significant recoveries have begun during phases of deep pessimism, when large holders quietly build exposure rather than chase rallies. The latest data confirms this pattern: while price approaches yearly lows, whale-driven transaction volume has risen, signaling that high-value wallets are repositioning rather than exiting. Whale Accumulation and CVD Shift Signal a Potential XRP Bottom The CryptoQuant report highlights that the recent surge in whale activity follows a pattern often observed during market bottoming phases. Large holders rarely accumulate aggressively during strong uptrends; instead, they tend to build positions quietly during periods of weakness, when sentiment is poor, and prices are depressed. Their willingness to buy in the current environment—while XRP trades near yearly lows—suggests strategic positioning rather than speculative momentum chasing. This behavior is typically interpreted as a pre-rally signal. When whales accumulate into weakness, it indicates confidence that current prices offer value and that the downside may be limited. Historically, such phases have preceded meaningful upside moves in XRP, as whale accumulation often absorbs available sell pressure and stabilizes market structure. Supporting this view, the report also points to a notable shift in the XRP Spot Taker CVD, which has turned taker-buy dominant. This means that aggressive buyers are now driving more of the executed volume, reflecting strengthening demand in real time. A taker-buy dominant CVD often emerges before sustained rallies, as it highlights increasing willingness among market participants to buy at the ask rather than wait for dips. Together, rising whale accumulation and a bullish CVD trend paint an increasingly constructive backdrop for XRP’s medium-term outlook. Related Reading: This Whale Isn’t Stopping: $392M Ethereum Long And A Tight Liquidation Price Revealed Price Analysis: Testing Yearly Lows as Structure Weakens XRP continues to trade near its yearly lows, with the chart showing a clear deterioration in trend structure. Price remains pinned below all major moving averages—the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day—indicating that bullish momentum has not yet returned. The persistent rejection at the 50-day moving average throughout November and December highlights the strength of overhead resistance and the absence of sustained buying pressure from the broader market. The $2.00 region, now acting as a key horizontal support, has been tested multiple times over the past month. Each retest shows reduced volatility, suggesting that sellers are no longer driving aggressive breakdown attempts. But demand remains too weak to generate a meaningful rebound. A decisive loss of this level could open the door toward the $1.80–$1.90 support zone. XRP previously consolidated during the early stages of the 2025 rally. Related Reading: Why Ethereum’s Rally Isn’t Overheated – And Where Demand Must Grow Next Volume also confirms the broader downtrend. Selling spikes stand out noticeably, whereas buy-side volume remains muted. This imbalance reinforces the prevailing bearish structure, even as whale accumulation begins to appear on-chain. For XRP to shift out of this downtrend, bulls must reclaim the 50-day moving average and produce higher lows. Until then, the chart signals continued caution. Whale activity must begin translating into visible spot demand, or the risk skews to the downside. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

The exchange added new spot pairs including ETH/USD1, SOL/USD1 and BNB/USD1, and enabled fee-free swaps between USD1 and other major stablecoins. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up?

This change means USD1 is being folded into its internal collateral and liquidity systems rather than remaining only a tradable token. Market Reaction And Liquidity Effects Traders reacted quickly.

Reports have also linked USD1 to a major Abu Dhabi investment that used the token for a $2 billion deal. Political Context And Scrutiny These commercial moves come after a politically charged episode: Trump granted a pardon earlier this year to Binance’s former CEO, an action that critics say raises questions about ties between Binance and the Trump family’s crypto interests. That sequence of events has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers and commentators, who are asking for more transparency around the deals and any possible conflicts of interest.

    "body": "As Pakistan continues to deepen its involvement in the digital asset landscape, the country has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with crypto exchange Binance, aiming to explore the tokenization of up to $2 billion in sovereign bonds, treasury bills, and commodity reserves to enhance liquidity and attract foreign investors. $2 Billion Asset Tokenization Initiative According to Reuters, the agreement sets the stage for a potential collaboration focused on allowing the tokenization and blockchain-based distribution of various real-world assets (RWAs) held by the Pakistani government. These assets may include sovereign bonds, treasury bills, and a range of commodity reserves such as oil, gas, metals, and other raw materials. Related Reading: Crypto Market Dips: The Reasons Behind Bitcoin Plunge Below $90,000 Despite FOMC Optimism The country’s finance ministry, Muhammad Aurangzeb, indicated that while the initiative could involve assets valued at up to $2 billion, final approval is still pending. The goal is to improve liquidity, transparency, and access to international markets for these assets. Aurangzeb remarked that the memorandum of understanding signifies Pakistan’s commitment to a reform-oriented economic trajectory and establishes a long-term partnership with Binance. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao expressed optimism about the agreement, calling it “a great signal for the global blockchain industry and for Pakistan.” He suggested that this partnership marks the beginning of a significant shift toward fully implementing the tokenisation initiative. PVARA Provides Initial Clearance For Binance And HTX In addition to this MoU, Pakistan has granted initial clearance for Binance and cryptocurrency exchange HTX, to register with local regulators as part of their efforts to establish domestic subsidiaries. This step allows both companies to prepare applications for full exchange licenses. The Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) provided these early approvals after assessing the governance and compliance frameworks of both platforms. Chairman Bilal bin Saqib indicated that these clearances initiate Pakistan’s phased licensing process, emphasizing that the strength of compliance will play a crucial role in determining which exchanges will proceed. This move comes as Pakistan accelerates its digital finance overhaul, which has included the formation of the Pakistan Crypto Council and the establishment of the PVARA, alongside the drafting of a formal licensing regime.

Notably, Pakistan ranks as the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency market by retail activity, according to Saqib. The government is also planning a pilot program for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and a comprehensive Virtual Assets Act.

    "title": "Kalshi To Power Coinbase New Internal Prediction Platform, Insider Reveals",
    "body": "According to a report from CNBC, Coinbase (COIN), the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, is preparing to launch its own prediction market in collaboration with Kalshi, one of the largest federally regulated financial exchanges in the country. Coinbase Teases Major Updates The anticipation surrounding the prediction market has been building for nearly a month. Recently, a screenshot of what appears to be Coinbase’s prediction markets dashboard was shared by Silicon Valley researcher Jane Manchun Wong in a post on social media site X (previously Twitter), shedding some light on the features of the forthcoming product. Related Reading: Crypto Market Dips: The Reasons Behind Bitcoin Plunge Below $90,000 Despite FOMC Optimism The Information first indicated on November 19 that Coinbase planned to introduce these prediction markets powered by Kalshi, with a formal unveiling set for the “Coinbase System Update” event scheduled for December 17. Formal announcements regarding this new platform are expected soon, potentially as early as next week. Bloomberg corroborated this report, stating that the cryptocurrency exchange is also likely to announce a tokenized stock offering during the same event, in line with Tether’s same vision reported earlier this week. While Coinbase has refrained from confirming these developments directly to CNBC, the company has encouraged stakeholders to tune in to its upcoming event for more details. The firm did not disclose a specific timeline for when the prediction markets will become available to users. ‘Everything Exchange’ Status Coinbase’s push to launch a prediction market is part of a broader strategy to transform itself into an “everything exchange”—a comprehensive platform for trading a wide variety of assets, including cryptocurrencies, tokenized stocks, and event contracts. CEO Brian Armstrong articulated this vision earlier in May, stressing that the cryptocurrency exchange aims to evolve into a leading financial services application within the next decade. This development comes as Coinbase faces increasing competition from rivals like Robinhood (HOOD), Gemini (GEMI), and Kraken, all of whom have introduced tokenized equity offerings for users outside the US and are exploring prediction markets to varying extents.

These include major deals such as the purchase of the crypto derivatives exchange Deribit and the on-chain advertising firm Spindl, as well as seven other major acquisitions. This also follows a shift in investor sentiment in the digital asset space, with the largest cryptocurrencies — including Bitcoin (BTC) — having retraced by over 30% since October amid fears of a new bear market beginning. Over the past months, the exchange’s stock, which trades under the ticker name COIN, has also seen a significant drop of over 39%, with the current valuation standing at $267 per share.

    "body": "Solana’s network took a notable step this week as Firedancer, a validator client developed by Jump Crypto, began running on the mainnet, and markets reacted quickly. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher According to Solana’s announcement, the client moved out of a controlled testing phase and is now active for real-world validation. Traders pushed SOL up about 5%, with the token trading close to $140 during the initial move. Firedancer Goes Live On Mainnet During more than 100 days of controlled tests, a small set of validators produced more than 50,000 blocks without downtime, according to reports. Built in C and C++, Firedancer was made to handle heavy workloads and to lower the chance of network interruptions. Test environments reportedly showed the client processing over 1 million transactions per second, a figure that far exceeds current mainnet throughput. BREAKING: After 3 years of development, Firedancer is now live on Solana Mainnet, and has been running on a handful of validators for 100 days, successfully producing 50,000 blocks 🔥💃 pic.twitter.com/Y0WxxEj2WL — Solana (@solana) December 12, 2025 That high number comes from lab-style tests, not live traffic, and should be read as experimental performance rather than everyday capability. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko marked the transition as a step out of a long beta cycle for the network. Early Adoption And Stake Adoption is still small in terms of stake. The first Firedancer nodes hold under one percent of total staked SOL, and that share is expected to grow as operators add it to their setups. Reports have disclosed that a December rollout prompted more than 20% of validators to move from earlier experimental clients, showing a rapid shift among some operators. Running multiple validator clients reduces dependence on a single software implementation. If one client encounters a bug, others can keep block production running. That diversity mirrors how other large proof-of-stake chains operate. Why This Matters For Validators And Apps Validators and developers stand to benefit if Firedancer keeps meeting its goals. Faster or more reliable validation could mean more capacity for apps that need many transactions per second. For node operators, the option to mix clients offers an added safety net. Still, the network’s real-world load will be the true test, and watchers say they will be looking at uptime and performance over the coming weeks.

    "body": "Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has again predicted that the XRP price could reach $27. This time around, he outlined the technical formation that could spark a parabolic surge for the altcoin as it eyes the $27 target. How The XRP Price Could Reach $27 In an X post, Egrag Crypto stated that the Linear Regression targets for the XRP price are $3.4, $10, and $27. He further explained that, as of this month, these three major price levels stand out based on the long-term Logarithmic Linear Regression Channel. The analyst then touched on each price target and how XRP could reach there. Related Reading: XRP Price Needs To Hold This Macro Support For Hope Of Revival Egrag Crypto described the $3.40 target for the XRP price as the mean reversion. He stated that a retest and rejection from $3.40 would be one of the strongest bearish TA signals for the altcoin. The analyst further remarked that this target is based solely on chart structure, not fundamentals. He added that a close above this level means that XRP is officially back in macro bullish territory. Furthermore, the analyst stated that the $10 target for the XRP price is the upper midline. He explained that this is where full bull expansion normally accelerates and that the target rises with time because this channel is logarithmic. Lastly, Egrag Crypto highlighted $27 as the top of the channel. He noted that multiple long-term confluences point to this target for the altcoin. Notably, this XRP price prediction comes amid several bullish fundamentals for the altcoin. Ripple was just granted a conditional approval for its national trust bank charter, which could boost XRP’s adoption. XRP also just expanded to Solana with Hex Trust’s launch of its wrapped XRP token for DeFi purposes. Meanwhile, Swiss bank AMINA Bank has integrated Ripple payments, which utilize XRP. The Major Levels To Watch Haven’t Changed Crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that the major levels for the XRP price haven’t changed. The macro supports are $2.03 and $1.64. On the other hand, the macro resistance is $2.41, which a break above would confirm a bullish scenario for the altcoin. The analyst remarked that if a break above $2.41 happens, the next measured targets stand around $2.75 and $2.90. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Rise To $14 By Frontrunning Bitcoin By Over 600% However, if the XRP price breaks below the macro support at $2.03, CasiTrades predicts that the altcoin could fall below $1.97 and decline towards the $1.64 major support. She reiterated that there is no official confirmation yet on the next potential move for XRP. Interestingly, the world’s largest IQ holder, YoungHoon Kim, stated that XRP has a strong possibility of reaching a new ATH by the end of this year. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.01, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Bearish Signals Are ‘Hard To Ignore’: Analyst Warns Of Drop To April Lows",
    "body": "As Bitcoin (BTC) tries to hold the $90,000 barrier, some analysts affirm that the flagship crypto’s bear market signals are becoming clearer, suggesting that a breakdown to new lows could be around the corner. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds Bitcoin Bear Flag Raises Concerns On Friday, Bitcoin shredded its Thursday gains, dropping 3.2% intraday to retest the $89,500-$90,500 support zone once again. The cryptocurrency has been trading between the $84,500-$94,500 range for the past four weeks, briefly falling to a seven-month low of $80,600 during the late November correction. This week, the flagship crypto’s price has seen more volatility, fueled by the expectations of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut and positive regulatory developments in the US. However, BTC has failed to successfully break and hold above its local range’s upper boundary after multiple retests, ultimately falling to the mid-zone of its range. Analyst Ted Pillows highlighted a concerning pattern on Bitcoin’s chart, warning that the cryptocurrency risks a drop to new multi-month lows if the price fails to hold key support levels. Per the post, BTC has been forming a bear flag for nearly a month, which “is too hard to ignore” after the price continues to be rejected from the formation’s upper boundary. The analyst affirmed that this pattern follows a trend that has been developing over the past two months. As he pointed out, bearish flags have been continuously forming on BTC’s chart since the October 10 market pullback, with each pattern resolving in a breakdown to lower levels. To Ted, the new formation signals “that the overall trend is still to the downside.” He suggested that a close above the $96,000 level would invalidate the bearish pattern. On the contrary, a drop to below the $86,000 support, where the formation’s lower boundary is located, could push Bitcoin to the April lows, around the $76,000 mark. Is The 2022 Playbook Repeating? The market observer also noted a resemblance between the last cycle and the current one, which could lead to a drop below the $70,000 level. The chart shows that after losing the 50-Week EMA indications, Bitcoin consolidated within a bear flag before breaking down and descending to the 2022 lows. Now, BTC displays a similar performance after losing the 50-Week EMA and breaking down from its October bear flag. “If this plays out, a pump to $100,000 and then a dump below $70,000” would follow, the analyst added. Meanwhile, Robert Mercer shared a similar perspective in a series of X posts. The analyst affirmed that the classic four-year cycle has not changed despite the significant increase in institutional adoption: Bitcoin is breaking crucial supports one by one and entering a bear market. The same happened back in the end of 2021. At the moment, BTC is forming an ascending channel with the top near $100,000 – $104,000, you can see a clear Right Shoulder of H&S in this move. Something similar happened in the beginning of 2022. He also asserted that Bitcoin shows a similar picture “from the 1W MA50 perspective,” as BTC has traded below this indicator for multiple weeks now for the first time in the bullish cycle. Related Reading: Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin Is ‘Climbing Another Wall Of Worry’– Here’s Why Nonetheless, he concluded that “no such breakdown happens without a retest,” forecasting a relief bounce up to $98,000-$102,000, followed by a dump to the support level of $55,000-$60,000. As of this writing, BTC Trades at $89,990, a 2.75% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Bullish Structure Weakens As Inter-Exchange Liquidity Touches Red Zone – Details",
    "body": "The Bitcoin market is experiencing a gradual trend reversal following weeks of prolonged price correction between October and November. However, recent on-chain data reveals a concerning trend around BTC’s bullish structure. Related Reading: Here’s Why Bitcoin’s Reaction To Fed Policy Turns Bearish After Each FOMC Update Bitcoin IFP Indicator Suggests Market Has Reached Turning Point Popular analytics page Arab Chain has shared a cautionary insight on the Bitcoin market despite the moderate price recovery in recent weeks. After Bitcoin suffered a 36.5% correction from its all-time high at $126,000, the market leader has lately experienced a significant rebound, rising from $80,000 to as high as $94,000 in the past three weeks. However, data from the Bitcoin Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP) suggests the upward price momentum might be short-lived. For perspective, the Bitcoin IFP measures the net movement of Bitcoin between exchanges over a given period. Arab Chain explains the IFP indicator continues to trend downward, after breaking below its 90-day moving average (MA), suggesting a weakening market participation amid fewer “bullish” flows between exchanges. Furthermore, the IFP also sits in the red zone, which historically coincides with or precedes a correction period or weak structural momentum that could precede a broader downtrend. Combined, these developments imply the Bitcoin market is at a critical junction, as there is a reduction in exchange flows that has historically supported the price rallies in past market phases.

Amidst the structural weakness highlighted by the IFP indicator, Arab Chain also noted that the price remains relatively high compared to previous levels in similar situations. The analysts explain that this suggests price and inflows are temporarily moving irrespective of each other. Based on historical data, such detachments usually indicate a prolonged price consolidation or a significant period of extended sideways movement until inter-exchange flows can reestablish market dominance. Therefore, the Bitcoin bullish structure is not collapsing into a bearish state. However, the IFP metric developments suggest there may not be sustained upward movement in the short term due to the structural slowdown in inter-exchange flows. Moreover, price is likely to become sensitive to changes in the market liquidity. Therefore, there is also significant potential for another correction. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $90,338, reflecting a 1.82% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, daily trading volume is up by 34.64% and valued at $82.68 billion. According to Arab Chain, a continuous price rebound will only occur if the IFP successfully reclaims its 90-day MA, thereby signaling an increase in bullish exchange flows.

    "title": "If This Ethereum Bear Flag Pattern Holds, ETH Price Could Be On Its Way To $2,400",
    "body": "Since early October, when the Ethereum price began its dive into bearish territory, it has struggled to regain any of its significant price levels. The Ether token failed to hold at multiple support zones throughout November, as it plunged downwards. While Ethereum appears to be gaining bullish momentum to signal an imminent price reversal, a bearish continuation looks like the more probable scenario after the latest decline to $3,000. A popular analyst has recently put forward a prognosis, which paints a worrying picture for the second-largest cryptocurrency. $2,400 Might Be The Next Price Cushion For ETH In a December 13 post on the social media platform X, market analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that the Ethereum price is showing an interesting sign of a potential bearish continuation over the coming weeks. Martinez’s analysis hinged on the bear flag pattern, a technical analysis pattern that is often used to confirm the continuation of a downtrend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Tightens Up: Symmetrical Triangle Converges With High-Timeframe Wyckoff Setup Typically, the pattern has two components — the flag and the flag pole. Price initially displays a sharp downward move, forming the flagpole. Afterwards, there is usually a brief period where the price displays upward movement or even sideways consolidation; this period of choppy price action makes up ‘the flag.’ What gives the flag its integrity is its upper and lower boundaries, which serve as resistance and support zones. Because breakouts beneath support zones typically indicate that the market could be bearish, a failure of the flag’s support would then be the needed confirmation of the earlier-seen sell signal. In the scenario where this happens, the crypto pundit pointed out that Ethereum’s possible target could be the $2,400 price level. This is likely the case because all preceding regions may present with insufficient liquidity to sponsor any significant price reversal. Ethereum Whales’ Realized Price Of $2,400 Comes In Sight — What To Expect Interestingly, on-chain data adds credence to $2,400’s reputation as a relevant price level. In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, a pseudonymous pundit, OnChain, revealed that Ethereum is currently happens to be trading very close to a significant price level. According to the analyst, Ethereum whales — with holdings of at least 100,000 ETH — mostly procured their coins close to $2,400. Interestingly, the Ether token barely ever falls to price levels close to the realized price of this group of investors. Since the last five years, there have only been four instances where the ETH price nearly reached the acquisition price of these whales, before eventually seeing major recoveries. If this historical pattern thus plays out, the second-largest cryptocurrency might have seen the beginning of yet another bullish rally. As of this writing, Ethereum holds a valuation of $3,086, reflecting a 4% price decline in the past day.

    "title": "Dogecoin Triangle Support Test Maps Out Recovery Roadmap And When To Sell",
    "body": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is testing the lower boundary of a long-term triangle pattern, a move that could determine its next major price direction. A new technical analysis highlights a roadmap with key recovery levels and outlines a potential timeframe when selling and profit-taking may become favorable. Dogecoin Triangle Pattern Signals Recovery Path In a recent X post, crypto analyst Jonathan Carter presented a new analysis of Dogecoin’s price action, predicting that a potential recovery may be imminent. Carter explained that Dogecoin is currently testing a critical support area around $0.135 within a long-standing descending triangle chart structure. The setup is unfolding over the 3-day timeframe, with price action remaining above the pattern’s lower boundary. This zone has become a key battlefield between buyers and sellers. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher Carter highlights that the ongoing support area offers a favorable risk-reward profile for market participants. Buyers stepping in at this level are attempting to prevent a breakdown that could invalidate the broader recovery outlook. This means holding above this support zone could keep Dogecoin’s bullish scenario intact. The descending triangle visible on the analyst’s shared chart shows a series of lower highs pressing against the stable support zone at $0.135. This compression often precedes a decisive move once the price reacts strongly at the base. Dogecoin’s current structure also suggests the market is steadily approaching that inflection point. The volume data at the bottom of the chart has yet to show strong expansion near the support area. This indicates that Dogecoin’s trading activity has been relatively muted, suggesting that the market may be waiting for confirmation before committing to a significant upward move. If Dogecoin successfully rebounds from the $0.135 support zone, Carter’s chart maps out several upside levels to watch. Initial recovery targets are seen around $0.155 and $0.190, where previous price reactions occurred. Clearing these levels would signal growing momentum and a possible end to DOGE’s downtrend. Further upside extensions projected on the chart include $0.250 and $0.310, which align with previous consolidation areas. A stronger continuation could open the path toward $0.370 and ultimately the resistance zone near $0.470. Resistance Zone Reveals When To Sell DOGE Carter’s Dogecoin chart clearly shows the $0.47 resistance zone, where sellers are expected to become active again. A rally into the zone would likely face increased selling pressure based on historical price behaviour. As a result, the resistance area serves as a strategic level for profit-taking rather than for new entries in Dogecoin. Related Reading: Binance’s USD1 Stablecoin Push Deepens Relationship With Trump’s Crypto Platform Overall, Carter’s analysis suggests that Dogecoin’s price is sitting at a pivotal technical level that could shape its next major move. The meme coin’s price is currently down, having crashed by over 22% year-to-date, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite this slip, Carter remains optimistic about DOGE’s recovery path. The recovery timeline highlighted in the analysis suggests that by 2026, the meme coin may have emerged from its downturn. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",
