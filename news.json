    "title": "Crypto Hacks Swipe Nearly $3 Billion In 2025 Despite Fewer Attacks – Report",
    "body": "As we approach the final day of a massive year for the crypto industry, a recent report revealed that the sector has lost nearly $3 billion amid the emergence of new trends from malicious actors and growing security complexities. Related Reading: Solana Bearish Formation Hints At Major Correction Until Mid-2026 – Here’s The Target 2025 Crypto Losses Increase By 45% On Tuesday, blockchain security firm SlowMist shared its 2025 Blockchain Security & AML Annual Report, highlighting the severe security challenges the crypto industry faced throughout the year. According to SlowMist, the total value stolen from crypto hacks increased by 46% in 2025 compared to 2024, a trend previously noticed by earlier reports. Notably, crypto theft had been more devastating by the first half of this year than the entirety of 2024. A Mid-Year report by Chainalysis showed that 2025’s activity by the end of June revealed a significantly steeper trajectory into the end of the first half than any previous year, with an alarming velocity and consistency. Now that the year is near its end, security incidents have cost approximately $2.935 billion, according to SlowMist data, significantly surpassing the $2.013 billion in losses from the previous year. However, the number of incidents dropped year-over-year (YoY) despite the total amount of losses increasing, signaling a trend of fewer but larger-scale crypto heists. The number of incidents declined by 51%, with 200 cases in 2025. In comparison, 2024 saw 410 reported hacks. The report shared that DeFi remained the most frequently targeted sector this year, with 126 security incidents, accounting for approximately 63% of all hacks and total losses of around $649 million. This represents a 37% and 62% YoY decrease from 2024’s 339 incidents and $1.029 billion in losses, respectively. Meanwhile, Centralized exchange (CEX) platforms reported 22 incidents, which accounted for $1.809 billion in losses, led by Bybit’s hack. The February attack resulted in approximately $1.46 billion being stolen in a single incident, becoming the most serious and largest security event of the year. Regulatory Enforcement Strengthens Although phishing remained one of the most active schemes, scams and intrusive attacks continued to evolve in 2025, noted SlowMist. Therefore, scams have become more deceptive and difficult to detect, with malicious actors no longer relying on a single method of attack to deceive victims: Traditional phishing has gradually expanded into permission hijacking, malicious code execution, and supply-chain poisoning. Attacks are no longer reliant on a single method; instead, they increasingly combine social engineering, browser exploitation, new protocol mechanics, and hybrid lure strategies to form stealthy and destructive attack chains. However, the report highlighted that crypto enforcement and sanction actions worldwide displayed a “clear trend of escalation” this year, as regulatory and law enforcement agencies directly intervened “in key areas of crypto-related money laundering, fraud, sanctions evasion, and illicit financing.” Related Reading: Crypto’s Big Money Signals Change: BTC Holders Pause, ETH Whales Buy Notably, there were 18 incidents this year in which lost funds were recovered or frozen. In these cases, the total stolen funds totaled to $1.95 billion, of which nearly $387 million was successfully returned or frozen. SlowMist concluded that “the development of the Web3 industry will no longer rely solely on technical innovation. (…) Organizations that can build stronger internal security controls, more transparent fund governance models, and more comprehensive KYT/AML review capabilities will gain longer-term resilience in the next cycle.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Coinbase Premium At Rare Discount As US Demand Weakens",
    "body": "The Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has witnessed a sharp decline into the negative zone recently, with its value now sitting at one of the lowest in the last 18 months. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Plunged In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap. This indicator keeps track of the difference between the BTCUSD price on Coinbase and BTCUSDT price on Binance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Optimism Returns To End 2025—What Usually Follows? Coinbase is mainly used by traders in the US, especially the large institutional entities, while Binance hosts a global traffic. As such, the Coinbase Premium Gap reflects the difference in behavior between American and offshore whales. When the value of the metric is greater than zero, it means the asset is trading at a higher value on Coinbase than Binance. Such a trend implies users of the former are applying a higher amount of buying pressure (or lower amount of selling pressure) as compared to the userbase of the latter. On the other hand, the indicator being negative suggests Binance may be observing a higher amount of accumulation as the cryptocurrency is going for a higher price on the platform. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the last year and a half: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has fallen into the negative territory recently, implying the American investors have shifted their behavior to one of higher selling pressure/lower buying pressure. In other words, demand from US traders has gone down. Currently, the indicator is sitting at a value of -$122, which means the cryptocurrency’s price is trading at a discount of $122 on Coinbase relative to Binance. The last time that the metric fell to such a low level was during the price crash in November. In recent times, US institutional entities have played an impactful role in the market, so the Coinbase Premium Gap, which acts a proxy of their behavior, has tended to have some correlation with the asset’s spot price. This pattern was once again seen in November, when a drawdown occurred in the cryptocurrency alongside a plunge into the red zone for the metric. So far, Bitcoin has managed to be relatively stable even with the low demand from the American whales, but it only remains to be seen how long that will continue, given the scale of the discount on Coinbase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Equilibrium: Active Market Participants Just Breaking Even The current value of the Coinbase Premium Gap is one of the lowest in the last 18 months, being seen on only five occasions in this window.

    "title": "Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Dump Is Over: On-Chain Data Just Flipped",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s long-term holder cohort appears to have stopped net selling, according to multiple on-chain commentators, in a shift that could remove a key source of structural supply pressure heading into 2026. The change hinges on a supply-change read of long-term holders (coins held longer than six months), which had been negative for months but has now turned modestly positive, said on-chain analyst Darkfost. Is This The Bitcoin Bottom Signal? Darkfost argues that recent claims about long-term holders “selling more than ever” miss what the data is actually showing, especially when large, discrete exchange-related movements skew the picture. “On this chart, which I adjusted to isolate the movement of nearly 800,000 BTC from Coinbase that was distorting LTH data, we can observe a clear shift in supply change,” Darkfost wrote. “Since July 16, the monthly LTH supply change (30 day sum) had been firmly anchored in a distribution phase until recently.” Related Reading: 2026 Bitcoin Price Predictions: What Banks, Institutions And Experts Forecast In plain terms, that meant the share of supply held by long-term holders had been declining for much of the second half of 2025, a regime that tends to coincide with persistent sell pressure as older coins rotate into the market. That phase, Darkfost said, has now ended, at least for the moment. “We have now moved back into positive territory, with around 10,700 BTC transitioning into long term held coins,” Darkfost wrote, calling it “a very modest change,” but “not insignificant.” The implication is that long-term holders have eased off distribution enough for their aggregate holdings to start rising again, even as short-term holders “continue to hold their BTC,” in Darkfost’s framing. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju echoed the directional takeaway in a shorter post, saying, “Bitcoin long-term holders stopped selling.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks A Year-Long Bear Market If This Happens: On-Chain Data VanEck’s head of digital research Matthew Sigel characterized the turn as a meaningful shift in positioning pressure via X. “BTC: Long-term holders turn net accumulators, easing a major Bitcoin headwind and ending, for now, the largest sell pressure event from this cohort since 2019,” Sigel wrote. Renowned expert James Van Straten added historical context to the scale of the move, saying the magnitude of distribution “marked the 2019 bottom as well,” suggesting the current inflection is notable even if it doesn’t, by itself, guarantee a repeat. Darkfost also pointed to historical patterning around these flips. “Historically, such shifts have often preceded the formation of consolidation phases or even bullish recoveries, depending on how the broader trend evolves,” he wrote, emphasizing conditions rather than certainty.

The combined market value already sits in the trillions, with Bitcoin alone worth about $1.75 trillion. That’s impressive, but Hoskinson argues it’s nowhere near the finish line. He believes the sector can grow to 2 billion users and hit a $10 trillion total valuation. That’s a fourfold jump in adoption and more than triple today’s market size. His timeline is clear too. Hoskinson says this could happen within the next 10 years, by 2035. Why Hoskinson Thinks Crypto Explodes From Here The key driver, according to Hoskinson, is real-world asset tokenization, often called RWA. It’s the idea of putting traditional assets—like bonds, property, and commodities—onto blockchains. This isn’t theoretical anymore. Data from RWA.xyz shows close to $20 billion worth of assets, including bonds and real estate, have already been tokenized. That number keeps climbing, even during slow market periods. UPDATE: #Cardano $ADA Founder Charles Hoskinson says the crypto industry will “grow to 2 billion users over the next 10 years and a $10 trillion market cap, because of the RWA revolution and the unification of the financial markets.” $NIGHT pic.twitter.com/F9mntPZd0I — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) December 28, 2025 Hoskinson says this trend changes everything. When assets move on-chain, crypto stops being just about trading tokens. It becomes financial infrastructure. Add in global payment rails and shared standards across blockchains, and you get what he calls a “unified financial market.” Privacy-focused projects also matter here. Hoskinson has pointed to initiatives like Midnight, which aim to balance compliance and privacy. He believes these tools could make institutions more comfortable bringing large pools of capital on-chain. Cardano’s Reality Check In The Market Still, Hoskinson’s optimism comes at an awkward time for his own network. Cardano (ADA) is ending the year under pressure. Selling has stayed heavy, and rallies haven’t lasted. Buying volume remains thin. Price action is stuck below key resistance levels, and momentum hasn’t flipped. As a result, ADA is hovering near important support zones. If those levels break, traders warn the token could drop below $0.30, a psychological line many are watching closely. Market activity overall has slowed, and for now, sellers are still in control. This disconnect hasn’t gone unnoticed. Critics argue Hoskinson’s push for cooperation is partly driven by Cardano’s struggle to attract users at the pace seen on other major chains. Abundance Of Wealth Hoskinson rejects the idea that crypto is a winner-takes-all game. He says the future isn’t about one chain dominating the rest. Instead, he sees room for many networks to grow together. Related Reading: Crypto Policy In The Hot Seat As US Lawmaker Calls SEC Hearing There’s lots of wealth to spread around, he’s said recently. In his view, projects with real use cases will find users naturally as the market expands. That thinking explains his openness to partnerships. Hoskinson has previously hinted at collaborations involving major ecosystems like XRP and Solana. The goal, he says, is shared growth, not tribal fights. Whether the industry reaches $10 trillion remains an open question. But here’s the thing: If RWAs keep moving on-chain and global finance truly starts to merge with crypto rails, the market Hoskinson imagines won’t sound so far-fetched anymore.

    "title": "Dogecoin Near $0.11–$0.12 Offers ‘Incredible Risk/Reward,’ Says Analyst",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Matt Hughes, who posts as “The Great Mattsby,” called the $0.11–$0.12 zone “incredible” risk/reward for Dogecoin in a Dec. 30 X post, sharing a weekly DOGE/USDT chart to argue the support is clearly defined. Another trader pushed back, saying traders may be “better off picking a good chart,” setting up a quick dispute over whether DOGE is a high-quality setup or just a cheap one. The Best Risk/Reward Zone For Dogecoin Hughes’ chart frames the $0.11–$0.12 area as a multi-year “line in the sand” on a weekly timeframe. On the right axis, DOGE is marked around $0.1236, sitting just above an orange horizontal band drawn slightly over $0.10. That horizontal is the zone Hughes is referring to, and it’s positioned where price has repeatedly based before, most notably during the long 2022–2023 trough, making it an obvious level for traders who want a nearby invalidation point. He also overlays a linear-scale Gann Square with several rising diagonal guides. The most relevant one is a green, upward-sloping support line that runs under price from the early history of the chart into 2026; the current pullback is compressing into that rising support at roughly the same time it meets the $0.11–$0.12 horizontal. In practical terms, the setup Hughes is advertising is confluence: a horizontal demand zone meeting a long-term uptrend line, which can offer a relatively tight “risk” reference if the level fails. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Mirrors Silver’s Breakout, Analyst Flags $9+ Scenario “Risk/reward in the .11-.12 zone for $DOGE is incredible here,” Hughes wrote. “You can visualize support perfectly with this linear scale Gann Square below.” Above spot, the next clearly marked band is a light-blue horizontal line around $0.23, which aligns with a region DOGE has churned around during prior rebounds. Higher up, Hughes’ chart marks additional overhead levels around $0.35 (green) and roughly $0.46 (teal), with a thick line near the upper end of the range around $0.58–$0.60. If the $0.11–$0.12 zone holds, the chart implies the market has room to work back into those overhead shelves; if it doesn’t, the next visible guideposts on the chart are lower rising diagonals in the $0.05–$0.07 region, which would represent a materially deeper reset on the same multi-year structure. On the macro backdrop, Hughes is clear: ” Crypto in 2026: The Bull Run That’ll Crush Fiat Dreams! While governments print money like it’s confetti and banks hoard your wealth, #Bitcoin hits $500K, #Ethereum flips entire industries, Solana owns speed, $XRP settles global finance overnight, and $DOGE moons harder than ever because the memes became money. Skeptics? You’re the same ones who called it a scam in 2021 because you bought the top. Time to wake up or get left in the dust.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Repeating Its 2020 Accumulation Cycle, Analyst Says Renowned trader Cheds Trading (@BigCheds) challenged the trade premise bluntly: “Prob better off picking a good chart than throwing money at a bad one.” Hughes didn’t reject the critique; he acknowledged momentum can be easier elsewhere, but restated his preference for a defined downside at the levels he highlighted: “Yea you can ride the momentum better that way but I like the risk/reward in this zone for DOGE.” Hughes’ post also landed alongside broader rotation chatter. He cited @MerlijnTrader approvingly in a separate message, echoing a sentiment-led thesis that altcoin turns often begin when positioning is defensive and conviction is thin. “Look at the wall street cheat sheet, man. We are in depression, right? Trot maps, emotion to price and it’s screaming maximum opportunity right now,” Merlijn said in a short video. “Just got to pick the right coins.” Merlijn tied any rotation to bitcoin’s next resolution and emphasized how uncomfortable those early turns tend to feel. “Once Bitcoin resolves now, all stone bottom one, Bitcoin is weak, right? So they bought them on Bitcoin and stable and everyone has emotionally given up on everything else,” he said. “That’s how rotations are born really quietly, uncomfortably before conviction returns.” For Dogecoin, Hughes’ chart reduces that broader debate to a single question: does the $0.11–$0.12 confluence area hold on the weekly, or does the market force traders to reassess risk further down the structure. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1232. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Sees 80% Spike In Major Metric, Why This Matters For Price Appreciation",
    "body": "XRP has recorded a notable surge in one of its most closely watched derivative indicators, which brings attention to how traders are positioning around the asset. Data shows that open interest tied to XRP derivatives jumped by about 80% within a very short four-hour window in the recent trading day, pointing to a sudden influx of leveraged activity. Moves of this magnitude rarely happen in isolation and often point to growing tension beneath the surface of price action, especially when they occur without a clean breakout on the chart. A Four-Hour Reversal After Days Of Weak Participation The spike in open interest shows a rapid increase in the number of outstanding XRP futures and perpetual contracts. When open interest rises this quickly, it usually means traders are aggressively opening new positions, often using leverage. Related Reading: XRP Stochastic RSI Just Touched 0.0 For The Second Time In History The speed of the move is what separates this spike from routine fluctuations. Prior to the surge, XRP open interest had been trending lower, showing reduced trader engagement and a cooling derivatives environment. However, this change was quickly reversed when open interest increased by over 80% in just a four-hour timeframe, culminating in the total number of outstanding contracts standing around 1.74 billion XRP at the time of writing. In terms of price, this translates to about $3.26 billion in exposure being held open across XRP futures markets, according to data from CoinGlass. Why This Setup Matters For XRP Price Appreciation XRP’s price action has been slow in recent days, with the cryptocurrency currently trading at $1.87. Price action has started to respond positively in the short term, though only modestly so far. XRP is up about 0.3% over the past 24 hours, a move that looks small on the surface. Related Reading: Can XRP Price Reach $10,000? Expert Says It’s Different Math, Different League However, when open interest expands this quickly and price begins to edge higher at the same time, it means that traders are leaning bullish and testing the upside, even if spot buyers have not yet committed in size. The lack of a strong breakout at this stage shows that the market is still probing for direction, but the balance has begun to tilt away from complete stagnation. The broader price action adds more context after zooming out slightly. XRP has gained roughly 0.8% over the past seven days, indicating a slow grind higher rather than a sudden impulse move. If price continues to inch higher and manages to clear nearby resistance levels, the elevated open interest could amplify upside moves as short sellers are forced to exit. On the other hand, if XRP’s price action stalls or falls back despite the recent 0.3% daily and 0.8% weekly gains, then the growing leverage on one side increases the risk of a bigger pullback. In that sense, even these small percentage gains matter. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "Standard Chartered analysts have predicted that the XRP price could surge by around 330%. They also outlined catalysts that could spark this price surge, which would lead to a new all-time high (ATH) for the Ripple-linked token. Standard Chartered Predicts XRP Price Surge To $8 Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoff Hendrick, has predicted that the XRP price could surge to $8 by the end of 2026, which represents an increase of around 330%. This would also mark a new all-time high for the token, with its current ATH at around $3.84. The analyst expects the token to record such growth, as it now has legal clarity following the settlement of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit. Related Reading: This Double Bottom Formation Could Send XRP Soaring To $2.5 Kendrick also expects the XRP price to surge to $8 on the back of regulatory clarity for the U.S. crypto industry and institutional adoption of the token through the XRP ETFs. The Standard Chartered analyst noted how the improving regulatory environment has made it easier for institutions to gain exposure to the token. Meanwhile, Ripple has been able to grow its payment system, which involves XRP, thanks to the regulatory-friendly environment. These XRP ETFs are notably seeing significant demand, which is bullish for the XRP price as it eyes a rally to $8 next year. SoSoValue data shows that these ETFs have yet to record a daily net outflow since the first spot fund launched last month. The XRP ETFs currently boast a net asset of $1.27 billion, which reprersents 1.12% of the token’s market cap. Crypto pundit Unknow noted that these ETFs are absorbing the supply fast, which is why he predicts that a supply shock could happen by early 2026, sending the XRP price higher. The pundit also declared that next year is the inflection point where the altcoin shifts from speculation to global liquidity infrastructure. XRP Is Preparing For a Breakout In an X post, crypto analyst TARA stated that the XRP price is approaching the critical $1.88 level and is in a very tight range, signaling a breakout is coming soon. The analyst noted that XRP needs to hold support at $1.87, even as Bitcoin approaches $88,000. She added that if the altcoin bounces from here and tests $1.88 again, it could break above that resistance and then hold it as support, which TARA noted would be a very bullish sign. In another X post, she revealed that XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was trying to break to the upside. TARA further remarked that if today’s close is bullish, with a close above $1.88, it could fuel the next wave to $2.30 for the XRP price. A positive for XRP is that Glassnode data shows that XRP on exchanges has dropped to a seven-year low of 1.6 billion tokens, down from 3.76 billion in October.

    "title": "Bitcoin Miner Distribution Re-Emerges: BTC Enters A Fragile Price Phase",
    "body": "Bitcoin has managed to reclaim the $88,000 level, offering a brief sense of stability after weeks of choppy price action. However, the broader picture remains fragile. Since early December, BTC has repeatedly failed to push above the $90,000 threshold, a level that continues to cap upside attempts and reinforce market hesitation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Sets The Stage For Bullish Cross In Q1 2026 Adding to the cautious outlook, CryptoZeno, a CryptoQuant analyst, points to miner behavior as a growing short-term risk factor. According to his analysis, Bitcoin miner outflows are signaling rising sell-side pressure, a dynamic that has historically mattered during periods of weak momentum. The data shows a clear relationship between miner activity and short-term price movements. Sharp increases in total miner outflows—especially when large volumes of BTC are sent to exchanges—have frequently coincided with local price pullbacks rather than sustained rallies. Miners are often considered informed market participants, typically operating with relatively low cost bases. When their distribution activity increases, it can introduce additional supply at moments when spot demand is already struggling to absorb selling pressure. While miner outflows alone do not define a broader market top, they can amplify short-term weakness, particularly in range-bound conditions like the one Bitcoin is currently facing. Miner Outflows Reinforce Short-Term Downside Risks The report explains that recent spikes in Bitcoin miner outflows have repeatedly been followed by immediate or near-term price weakness, reinforcing the link between miner behavior and short-term market dynamics. These episodes suggest that miners—often considered informed participants with relatively low production cost bases—are actively distributing supply during periods of strength or heightened uncertainty. While a miner selling on its own does not signal a macro market top, it frequently adds incremental supply at sensitive moments, increasing short-term pressure when liquidity is thin, or spot demand is unable to absorb new inflows. CryptoZeno adds that elevated miner outflows typically reflect a combination of factors. These include profit realization after rallies, the need to cover operational expenses, or a defensive response to weakening price structure. From an on-chain perspective, this behavior is not unusual during corrective or range-bound phases. However, when miner transfers to exchanges cluster within a short time window, their impact becomes more pronounced. Concentrated outflows can materially increase sell-side pressure on exchanges, raising the probability of corrective price moves rather than sustained upside continuation. At the macro level, miner distribution becomes especially influential when paired with broader headwinds. Neutral or declining risk appetite, tighter liquidity conditions, or cooling derivatives sentiment all reduce the market’s capacity to absorb additional supply. In such environments, miner-driven selling is less likely to be smoothly digested and can instead amplify downside volatility, keeping Bitcoin vulnerable in the near term. Related Reading: XRP Slides To $1.80 While Binance Reserves Continue To Decline Bitcoin Struggles Below Key Resistance Bitcoin continues to trade in a tight consolidation range after failing to reclaim the $90,000 level, as shown on the daily chart. Following the sharp breakdown in November, price found support in the $85,000–$87,000 zone, where selling pressure began to ease and volatility compressed. Since then, BTC has been moving sideways, signaling indecision rather than a decisive trend reversal. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin remains capped below its declining short-term moving averages. The 50-day moving average continues to slope downward and acts as dynamic resistance. The 100-day and 200-day moving averages sit well above the current price, reinforcing a broader bearish structure. As long as BTC trades below these levels, upside attempts are likely to be sold into rather than sustained. Related Reading: XRP Selling Pressure Returns: Investors Shift From Holding to Distribution After the heavy sell-off in November, trading volume has gradually declined. This suggests that aggressive sellers have stepped back, but new demand has not yet entered with conviction. This typically characterizes a stabilization phase rather than the start of a new impulsive move. Structurally, Bitcoin is forming a base, but confirmation remains absent. A daily close above $90,000 could signal a meaningful shift in momentum. And would open the door for a recovery toward higher resistance zones. Conversely, a loss of the $85,000 support area could expose BTC to another leg lower. For now, the chart reflects balance, hesitation, and a market waiting for a catalyst.

    "title": "Expert Says XRP ‘Haters’ Miss The Bigger Picture: Here’s What It Is",
    "body": "A prominent XRP commentator is pushing back on a familiar critique of Ripple’s business model, arguing that skeptics have the causality backwards when they claim the company sells XRP merely to amass traditional assets. In a post on X on Wednesday, CryptoInsightUK founder Will Taylor said the “haters” are “so close to being right,” but miss what he framed as the single step that changes the entire equation. What ‘Haters’ Get Wrong About XRP Taylor’s central claim is that Ripple’s token sales are not designed to swap out a volatile crypto asset for safer, conventional holdings. Instead, he described the sales as a means of funding infrastructure and integrations that ultimately increase the token’s long-term utility and value. “Haters say Ripple sell XRP so they can buy real-world companies and assets, because that’s how Ripple ‘makes money’,” Taylor wrote. “In my opinion, that completely misunderstands the business model and more importantly, the direction of causality. Yes, Ripple monetises some XRP. But not to replace XRP with traditional assets.” In Taylor’s telling, the misunderstanding starts with treating XRP like operating cash rather than a strategic, asymmetric asset. He argued that a large holder of an asset with outsized upside potential would not logically liquidate it simply to “stack normal companies,” especially if that asset could become worth more than the firm’s balance sheet at scale. Related Reading: XRP Becomes Most Bought Digital Asset, Bitcoin And Ethereum Bleed $500 Million “If you hold roughly 40% of an asset that, at scale, could be worth more than your entire balance sheet, you don’t treat it like operating cash,” he wrote. “You don’t say: ‘Let’s sell the most asymmetric asset we own just to stack normal companies.’ That would be insane.” From there, Taylor reframed Ripple’s acquisitions, integrations, and buildout efforts not as a pivot away from XRP but as “multipliers” that increase the odds XRP becomes a viable global settlement instrument. Traditional assets, he argued, are inputs to expand distribution, compliance, and liquidity: conditions that would make a bridge asset more useful at institutional scale. “When Ripple acquires or integrates with firms like Hidden Road, stablecoin infrastructure, or tokenised treasury rails, those assets are not the end goal,” Taylor wrote. “They are multipliers. Those companies are not replacing XRP. They are building the pipes that require XRP to function efficiently.” Related Reading: XRP Still Has A Path To $28 This Cycle, Analyst Says Taylor positioned this as a flywheel: XRP sits at the “strategic core” on the balance sheet, Ripple builds a full stack around payments and liquidity, institutions adopt because the rails are complete, and the token becomes a neutral settlement layer whose demand compounds over time. Under that framework, he said, short-term monetization is better understood as capital deployment in service of a long-term network effect rather than straightforward dilution. “That’s not dilution. That’s capital deployment,” Taylor wrote, adding that if Ripple simply wanted to be “a profitable TradFi-style company,” it would not “obsess over neutral settlement,” keep XRP “architecturally central,” or push it into “regulated institutional rails.” The distinction matters because it changes how observers interpret Ripple’s incentives. In Taylor’s model, the objective is not to sell the token in order to accumulate off-chain assets; it is to use off-chain assets—licenses, liquidity venues, compliance infrastructure, and institutional integrations—to increase XRP’s necessity as a settlement tool. “The endgame is not: ‘Sell XRP to buy assets,’” he wrote. “The endgame is: ‘Use assets to make XRP unavoidable.’” At press time, XRP traded at $1.8773.

    "title": "Ethereum Liquidity Rebuilds On Binance: December Inflows Signal Strategic Repositioning",
    "body": "Ethereum remains trapped below the critical $3,000 level as price action compresses into an increasingly narrow range. Despite several recovery attempts, bulls have failed to regain control, leaving ETH vulnerable to renewed downside pressure. Market sentiment reflects this weakness, with a growing number of analysts leaning toward a bearish outlook for 2026 as momentum indicators continue to fade and risk appetite remains subdued across the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Sets The Stage For Bullish Cross In Q1 2026 Amid this fragile technical backdrop, new on-chain data highlights a notable shift in Ethereum’s liquidity structure. According to a CryptoQuant report by analyst Arab Chain, Ethereum reserves on Binance surged to approximately 4.17 million ETH in December. This increase coincided with massive inflows totaling nearly 8.5 million ETH over the month, marking one of the most significant exchange inflow events since 2023. Such a sharp rise in exchange-held ETH suggests a change in investor behavior. Historically, large inflows to centralized exchanges indicate preparation for increased trading activity, hedging, or potential selling pressure, rather than long-term accumulation. While inflows alone do not guarantee immediate downside, they often precede periods of higher volatility, especially when the price is already struggling to reclaim key resistance levels. Exchange Liquidity Rises as Volatility Risks Build The CryptoQuant report emphasizes that the sharp increase in Ethereum reserves on Binance—the world’s largest exchange by trading volume—indicates a significant increase in tradable supply. When ETH moves from cold storage or long-term wallets onto centralized exchanges, it typically reflects a shift toward active positioning. Historically, this behavior has been a key input for assessing short- to medium-term supply–demand dynamics, as higher exchange balances increase the amount of ETH readily available for trading, hedging, or liquidation. However, the report stresses that rising exchange reserves do not automatically translate into immediate selling pressure. In many cases, large inflows are associated with risk management strategies rather than outright distribution. Institutional participants often move assets to exchanges to deploy them as collateral, rebalance exposure, or hedge downside risk through derivatives markets, particularly during periods of macro uncertainty and compressed price action. Still, the scale of December’s inflows stands out. Nearly 8.5 million ETH flowed into Binance over the month, marking the highest net inflows since 2023, with daily net inflows peaking above 162,000 ETH. Such volumes suggest the involvement of large players and point to a potential transition into a more volatile market phase. With Binance commanding a dominant share of Ethereum derivatives trading, this concentration of ETH on the exchange raises the probability of sharp price moves. Whether driven by spot selling or leveraged positioning, elevated exchange liquidity increases the market’s sensitivity to shifts in sentiment, making the current consolidation phase increasingly fragile. Related Reading: XRP Slides To $1.80 While Binance Reserves Continue To Decline Ethereum Price Compresses As Momentum Fades Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart reflects a market stuck in compression just below the $3,000 psychological level. After a sharp decline earlier in the month, ETH attempted several rebounds but consistently failed to reclaim higher ground, resulting in a tight range between roughly $2,900 and $3,100. This structure signals indecision rather than accumulation, with both buyers and sellers lacking conviction. Technically, Ethereum remains capped below its short- and medium-term moving averages. The 50-period and 100-period averages are acting as dynamic resistance, repeatedly rejecting upside attempts. Meanwhile, the 200-period moving average continues to slope downward, reinforcing the broader bearish trend. As long as ETH trades below these levels, rallies are likely to remain corrective rather than trend-changing. Related Reading: Chainlink Shows Strong Accumulation Signal: LINK Exchange Liquidity Dries Up Trading activity has steadily declined during the consolidation phase, indicating reduced participation and growing apathy. The absence of strong volume expansion on upside moves suggests that buyers are not aggressively stepping in, even near key support. Structurally, the $2,900–$2,950 zone is acting as short-term support, preventing deeper drawdowns for now. However, the longer ETH remains compressed below $3,000, the greater the risk of a volatility expansion. A decisive break above $3,100 would be required to shift momentum to the bullish side. Until then, Ethereum remains vulnerable to renewed downside pressure if broader market sentiment deteriorates. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP At Risk Of A Drop To $0.80? Analyst Makes The Case",
    "body": "A cryptocurrency analyst has explained how XRP could be at risk of a drop toward $0.80 based on the data of some on-chain indicators. XRP Has Seen Bearish Developments In On-Chain Data In a new thread on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about why XRP may be at risk of seeing a decline to the $0.80 level. “First, network activity has cooled sharply,” noted Martinez. There are many ways to gauge network activity, but the analyst has used the Active Addresses on-chain indicator. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium At Rare Discount As US Demand Weakens This metric keeps track of the total number of addresses that are taking part in some kind of transaction activity on the blockchain every day. A chart shared by the analyst earlier showed a drawdown in this metric for XRP. Generally, a decline in the metric is a sign of a drop in interest around the asset. “Daily active addresses have fallen to roughly 38,500, pointing to fading participation and interest,” said Martinez. Another on-chain indicator has also shown a development recently: the supply held by the whales. Whales refer to the big-money investors of the market who carry significant amounts in their wallets. As the below chart shows, these investors participated in selling of about 40 million tokens recently. Due to the massive size of their holdings, whales are considered to be influential entities on the network, so their behavior could be relevant for the cryptocurrency. As these massive hands have been selling on the XRP blockchain recently, it’s possible that the coin could feel a bearish effect. If nothing else, the trend reflects that the asset’s key investors are showing weaker confidence. Finally, the analyst has shared a chart for the cryptocurrency’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). This indicator basically tells us about the amount of supply that investors last purchased at the various price levels that the coin has visited in its history. From the chart, it’s visible that a notable amount of supply has its cost basis at the $1.77 level, which isn’t too far below the current XRP spot price. It’s possible that if the asset retests this level, these investors who purchased there could show some kind of reaction. When the market mood is bullish, this reaction tends to be dominated by buying. Given the current sentiment in the digital asset sector, however, the support may not be sufficient. “If selling pressure continues, XRP risks losing the $1.77 support,” explained Martinez. “A breakdown there opens the door to the next major support zone near $0.80.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Optimism Returns To End 2025—What Usually Follows? This support zone near $0.80 is currently the largest demand zone beyond the $1.77 level. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $1.86, unchanged from one week ago.

    "title": "Ethereum Optimism For 2026: Analysts Share Bullish Forecast Despite Disappointing End-Of-Year",
    "body": "As Ethereum (ETH) is set to end the year on a disappointing note, some market observers have shared an optimistic outlook for the altcoin’s start-of-year performance, suggesting that an early 2026 breakout remains possible. Related Reading: Crypto Hacks Swipe Nearly $3 Billion In 2025 Despite Fewer Attacks – Report Ethereum Holds ‘Equilibrium Level’ Ethereum is attempting to end the year above a crucial area following its recent sideways action. Notably, the cryptocurrency has been in a downtrend for the past three months, currently recording a 27.8% decline from its Q4 opening of $4,145. ETH has been trading sideways over the past several weeks, hovering within the $2,800-$3,000 price range. During this period, the King of Altcoins has failed to hold above the upper boundary on the weekly timeframe despite multiple attempts to break out. Amid this performance, market watcher Crypto Batman recently noted Ethereum is trading around the mid-zone of a multi-year bullish channel, which he named “the equilibrium level.” This zone has historically acted as both a strong support and resistance point for Ethereum, he explained, making it the crucial area to hold as we approach the monthly and yearly closes. Despite the recent price action, Crypto Batman suggested that “given how ETH rallied from $1,500 to $4,600, this current move looks like nothing more than a bullish retest to that equilibrium, likely forming the next higher low.” Similarly, analyst Cas Abbé affirmed that the leading altcoin’s structure remains “incredibly bullish” even with the recent volatility, highlighting ETH’s uptrend line on the higher timeframes. According to the post, the cryptocurrency has not only held its ascending trendline over the past eight months but also bounced after each retest, suggesting that a rebound could be possible if this level continues to hold on the higher timeframes. ETH Breakout In Early 2026? Crypto Jelle also shared a bullish outlook for Ethereum, affirming that the altcoin looks strong on the macro chart. “If price can push towards $4k from here, I doubt bears can hold it down again,” the analyst wrote on X, adding that “It might finally be time for ETH to shine again next year.” Market observer Trader Tardigrade underscored a giant Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern on ETH’s weekly chart. Per the post, the cryptocurrency has been forming this bullish pattern for the past two years, with the neckline currently located around the $4,950-$5,000 mark. Notably, the left shoulder and head developed during the Q3-Q4 2024 and Q2-Q3 2025 rallies. Meanwhile, the Q4 2025 correction has started to form the pattern’s right shoulder, which signals that the altcoin could rise to the neckline area in the next few months, and potentially aim for higher levels if the pattern continues to develop. In the shorter timeframe, Man of Bitcoin noted that Ethereum could see a breakout in the first week of 2026. The analyst pointed out a one-month symmetrical triangle formation on ETH’s chart, where the price has been “getting squeezed between both trendlines.” Related Reading: Solana Bearish Formation Hints At Major Correction Until Mid-2026 – Here’s The Target While the altcoin continues to compress between these levels, a break from the pattern becomes more likely, leading the market watcher to suggest a 15%-20% breakout toward the $3,400 resistance. As of this writing, ETH is trading at $2,977, a 1.2% increase in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",
