    "title": "Are XRP ETFs About To Act Like Banks? Expert Thinks So",
    "body": "US Senate debate over a bill called the Clarity Act has reignited discussion about XRP and other crypto products, and how they might be treated under US rules. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record Levels As Buterin Urges Builders To Deliver Real Apps Reports have disclosed that the bill could give clearer status to tokens that back US-listed ETFs, moving them closer to commodity-style treatment. XRP spot ETFs have also drawn large capital, with inflows reaching about $1.37 billion since their November 2025 launch — a figure that underlines why lawmakers and market watchers are paying attention. How It Works Creation and redemption in ETFs can happen “in kind,” which means the fund can accept the actual asset instead of cash. That mechanism is real, but it does not let ordinary buyers load tokens directly into a fund. Authorized participants — big broker-dealers and market makers — are the ones that hand tokens to ETFs and receive shares back. Everyday investors buy or sell ETF shares on exchanges. That gap is central to the debate about whether an ETF could ever function like a bank. The XRP ETF’s are also In-Kind Funds, so you can deposit XRP directly into the fund in exchange for the exact value in shares. Most in general will choose this option post law. There are many advantages to this, you will be able to use the ETF like a “bank”. https://t.co/2G49kxUpGc pic.twitter.com/4fyeOkEYTC — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) January 13, 2026 What Community Voices Are Saying According to posts from XRP community figures, some see a future where ETFs act like a regulated parking spot for token holders. Chad Steingraber has been vocal about in-kind mechanics, arguing that investors could swap XRP for matching ETF shares and treat the funds as a safer place to hold value until they need to move tokens again. Those comments have helped popularize the idea that ETFs could be used in a bank-like way. What Taxes Might Look Like Reports and investor guides show that ETF structure matters for taxes. ETFs often use in-kind creation and redemption to avoid routine capital gains distributions at the fund level, which helps make ETFs tax-efficient in many cases. But tax consequences for token holders depend on how transactions are carried out and on the product’s legal structure. Under current US rules, transfers that change the form of an asset can create taxable events for the person handing over the asset, and fund-level distributions can still produce tax bills for investors. Related Reading: Ethereum On Fire: User Growth Sparks Massive Activity Spike According to Chad Steingraber, the in-kind structure gives XRP holders a regulated place to park their tokens when they want safety and oversight. Investors, Steingraber believes, may favor ETFs once the Clarity Act clarifies rules. The appeal is not the technical steps but the confidence of holding XRP in a regulated, organized product. For him, ETFs offer a safer way to manage tokens while still keeping access to them when needed. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Finally Flips Positive — Why This Shift Matters",
    "body": "The price of Bitcoin began the new week on an exciting move to the upside. The premier cryptocurrency recorded a price ascent of about 9%, reaching a high of over $97,000 and falling just short of its past six-figure valuation. Interestingly, a recent on-chain revelation shows that an underlying change was simultaneously taking place as the price of Bitcoin soared on the charts. Are The BTC Bulls Back In Control? In a January 16 post on social media platform X, crypto analyst Darkfost revealed a notable shift in the on-chain power dynamics, saying that the bulls are seemingly back in control. The relevant indicator here is the BTC Net Taker Volume, which tracks which of the buyers or sellers is more aggressive in the market. The metric does so by measuring the net difference between buy and sell market orders executed on derivatives exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Free From The Current Range — $107,000 Now The Level To Watch Before this recent shift, the net taker volume had fallen into deep negative territory, reaching a bottom of about –$489 million. Due to the lack of demand in the market over that period, the price of BTC continued to fall as selling pressure grew. However, this market scenario has shifted, as of Friday, January 16th. The Bitcoin Net Taker Volume now records a positive reading, with more than $39 million in buy-side volume from the futures market. This means BTC traders are becoming increasingly interested in opening long positions — and aggressively at that. Historically, an increasing buying interest among participants of the futures market typically signals rising bullish sentiment. In turn, upward price pressure increases through leverage, leading to amplified short-term price moves if sustained. Bitcoin Market Outlook Darkfost further explained that, although there are signs that Bitcoin ETF inflows might be picking up slightly, it remains that spot buying is yet to gain enough strength to sponsor a decisive bullish move. As a result, all eyes fall on derivatives activity, as it currently serves as support for the Bitcoin price. Ultimately, the present scenario is best interpreted as the end of bearish pressure, rather than a blatant structure shift. However, in the event that net taker volume continues to grow positively, the narrative could shift from dwindling bearish pressure to mounting bullish momentum. Till then, market participants are advised to deal cautiously until it is confirmed that the derivatives-sponsored momentum is sustainable for the flagship cryptocurrency’s growth. As of press time, the price of Bitcoin stands at about $95,357, with insignificant movement over the past day.

    "title": "AVAX Pushes Toward $18 As Key Resistance Looms: Analyst",
    "body": "AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche protocol, is ready for a potential price breakout following another week of significant mixed price action. In line with the widespread crypto market uplift, the altcoin had initially surged as high as $14.85 before retracing below the $13.50 price. According to analyst Ali Martinez, AVAX now lies at another critical price juncture, with the next price move likely to determine its short-term trend. Related Reading: SUI Reclaims Smart Money Zone, While Weekly Structure Signals Big Move Ahead Here’s Why AVAX Must Clear $14.83 Resistance In an X post on January 16, Martinez shares an insightful analysis of the AVAX 12-hour trading chart, identifying a key price zone and an important chart formation. According to the presented technical review, AVAX’s recent rejection around $14.85 can be attributed to heavy resistance in this region. Most notably, the altcoin has struggled to break past this $14.83 price barrier thrice in the last month, indicating a significant willingness among investors to sell when the price approaches this zone. This could be driven by a general view of such a price point as a good profit-taking zone or expectation of a price decline based on historical data. It’s worth noting that Martinez’s analysis also shows that AVAX price movement has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, thereby favoring an imminent upside breakout. For context, the inverse H&S formation is a bullish pattern that signals a potential trend reversal. As seen above, it consists of three troughs: the left shoulder, where price declines, then rebounds; the head, a deeper decline to around $11.26 followed by a recovery, and the right shoulder, a higher low ($13.75) that fails to reach the depth of the head. All rebound highs are connected by a resistance line ($14.83) known as the neckline. And a bullish breakout indicates strengthening buying pressure. Therefore, Martinez explains that AVAX must push past this barrier in a decisive manner to trigger a bullish breakout towards $17.59 as an initial price target. With sustained buying pressure, the analyst predicts a further rise to $18.41, representing a potential 35% gain on present market prices.

    "title": "Ethereum Maintains Structural Strength Despite Resistance Near $3,400",
    "body": "Ethereum continues to show resilience, holding its ground above key support levels even as price faces firm resistance near the $3,400 zone. The ability to sustain strength after recent gains highlights improving market structure, suggesting that buyers remain in control. As long as ETH stays supported above its critical trend levels, the broader upside narrative remains intact despite near-term hesitation. Daily Bull Market Support Band Holds As Key Reversal Zone Luca, in a recent ETH update shared on X, pointed out that Ethereum’s market structure has strengthened considerably over the past several days. The price has been able to hold above the 1D Bull Market Support Band, a level that has acted as a reliable reversal zone multiple times over the last couple of months. This sustained hold suggests improving market confidence and a reduction in immediate downside risk. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Pushes Toward Breakout Levels, Bulls Smell Opportunity Alongside this structural improvement, ETH successfully reclaimed the 0.618 Fibonacci point of interest around the $3,100 region. This level is often viewed as a critical threshold in corrective phases, and holding above it typically signals that buyers are gaining the upper hand. Despite the positive developments, Ethereum has not moved higher without hesitation. ETH’s price recently faced rejection near the 0.5 Fibonacci level around $3,400, an outcome Luca noted was largely expected. Historically, this area has acted as a significant decision point, often attracting selling pressure and temporary pullbacks before the market decides on its next direction. Looking forward, Luca believes the overall outlook remains constructive as long as ETH continues to trade above the 1D Bull Market Support Band and the 0.618 Fibonacci level. Maintaining these supports would keep the path open for renewed upside attempts, even if short-term consolidations occur, and the analyst’s positioning remains unchanged. ETH Above Daily 200MA, Structure Remains Constructive According to a recent post by Daan Crypto Trades, Ethereum is still advancing gradually while respecting the Daily 200-day moving average against Bitcoin. This type of slow, methodical grind often signals strength beneath the surface, suggesting that buyers remain in control even without aggressive momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Q1 Outlook: Analyst Shares Historical Setup As Price Nears Key Resistance The analyst explained that prolonged consolidations and steady climbs like this typically resolve with an acceleration phase. Should ETH break out with stronger upside momentum, it could serve as a trigger for renewed interest across the altcoin market, helping lift sentiment and price action. However, the structure remains conditional. Holding the Daily 200MA, highlighted in purple, is critical to maintaining this constructive setup. In parallel, Bitcoin must stay above the $94,000 level to maintain the broader low-timeframe bullish structure. As long as these conditions are met, the path of least resistance continues to favor further upside. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Analyst Reveals How Far Bitcoin Price Will Crash If The Uptrend Doesn’t Continue",
    "body": "A warning signal is flashing on the charts, with market analysts predicting that the Bitcoin price could collapse again soon. According to technical analysis, if BTC fails to continue its uptrend, it could repeat the bear-market crash from past cycles, potentially dragging its price down by double-digit percentages. Bitcoin Price To Repeat 2022 Bear Market Crash? Crypto analyst Tyrex believes that Bitcoin may be approaching a critical turning point if the current uptrend fails to hold. In his latest BTC price outlook on X, he compares the current market structure to the April 2022 cycle, when Bitcoin made an ATH and then crashed hard for weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum On Fire: User Growth Sparks Massive Activity Spike Tyrex disclosed that Bitcoin dropped roughly 45% from its all-time high in 2022 before entering an extended consolidation phase that lasted nearly four months. The accompanying chart shows that during that period, prices respected clear horizontal boundaries, creating a false sense of strength and stability, all while underlying weakness continued to build. That consolidation eventually led to an upside fakeout, with the Bitcoin price briefly breaking resistance before reversing sharply. Unfortunately, the rejection triggered a continuation of the broader downtrend that year, resulting in another aggressive price crash that wiped out remaining bullish confidence. According to Tyrex, BTC’s current chart structure closely mirrors the same historical setup from 2022. Bitcoin has once again pulled back sharply after reaching an all-time high of over $126,000. Additionally, the cryptocurrency has spent roughly two months consolidating within a defined range, repeatedly stalling at resistance levels. Tyrex warns that Bitcoin is barely holding above $95,000, which aligns with the resistance zone shown on the chart. If price fails to recover and continues to stall near this level, the move higher could turn out to be a fakeout, potentially leading to another sharp dump— just as it did in 2022. The red-shaded area on the chart shows how far BTC could crash if the uptrend breaks, with the analyst projecting an 11.04% drop to the $86,000-$84,000 range. Bitcoin Set For March ATH And May Flash Crash Another forecast from market expert CryptoXLarge outlines where Bitcoin could be headed over the next four months. The analyst bases the outlook on historical market behavior, suggesting the current cycle may be replicating past cycle peaks. CryptoXLarge points to January 2026 as a phase of quiet accumulation with controlled price action and muted volatility. February is expected to bring a powerful rally as momentum builds rapidly and buyers push the BTC price higher. This surge could set the stage for Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high around $240,000 in March.

    "title": "Bitcoin Records Large Exchange Inflows As Price Climbs — What Next For BTC?",
    "body": "Bitcoin recently failed to overcome the $97,000 resistance following its price surge seen in mid-January. At the moment, the leading cryptocurrency has taken on a state of inertia, with no significant movement in either direction seen. However, an investigation of on-chain dynamics has recently revealed that trouble might be looming for the flagship cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Key Support As Weekend Liquidity Sets In — $98,200 And $107,500 In Focus Sudden Inflows: Caution Or Opportunity? In a QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, key opinion leader CryptoZeno shares a potentially foreboding observation on Bitcoin’s market dynamics, saying the premier cryptocurrency could be facing a risk of distribution in the near-term. This conjecture is based on the Bitcoin: Exchange Inflow (Total) – All Exchanges metric, which serves the basic function of tracking the total amount of BTC transferred into centralized exchanges over a certain period. CryptoZeno highlights in the post that exchange inflows have seen sharp surges through Bitcoin’s most-recent trading sessions, which represent one of the most significant spikes seen in the month of January. Typically, large inflows of BTC into exchanges act as a telltale sign that investors are preparing to distribute their holdings. This is contrary to any inclination towards long-term holding. Interestingly, the sign of distribution-readiness is more typical if the event were to occur just after a strong advance of the BTC price. Also citing historical occurrences, CryptoZeno explains that such behavior, where BTC holders increasingly send their tokens to exchanges, suggests that investors are venturing out of Bitcoin and to more “liquid venues.” Expectedly, such a massive dispersal of their holdings would translate into price as increased sell-side pressure, especially in the short-term. Notably, the analyst makes it clear that inflows alone do not tell a sure story of an immediate reversal. More accurately, spikes in exchange inflows often come before heightened volatility periods or corrective price action. Related Reading: Are XRP ETFs About To Act Like Banks? Expert Thinks So Analyst Highlights Mid- To Large-Size Bands As Main BTC ‘Movers’ CryptoZeno provides more context by merging the Spent Output Value Bands with the Exchange Inflow metric. This shows which investor cohort was more involved in creating the distribution signal seen. On inspection of the blended metric, it becomes apparent that the spike in exchange inflows was largely induced by mid-to-large size bands (10-100 BTC, and 100-1,000BTC). These size bands, according to the crypto expert, are associated with whales, long-term investors who are repositioning, or even ETFs. These investor classes do not merely act without strategic reasons. As a result, their activity is usually more important compared to retail activity. A simultaneous increment to exchange inflows, alongside large investor distribution, is another sign that the Bitcoin market is on the brink of a fragile phase. In the event that inflows remain high as price struggles to reclaim past highs, the world’s leading cryptocurrency could be entering a phase of trouble, as it would suggest the predominance of supply over demand. As of this writing, Bitcoin is worth $95,250, recording almost no growth since the past day. Featured image from Flickr, chart from Tradingview",

    "title": "SUI Price Breakout Next? Analyst Sets $2.3 Short-Term Target",
    "body": "The SUI price struggled to replicate its early-year momentum over the past week despite the general market seeing renewed optimism. The altcoin’s price mostly moved sideways, oscillating between the $1.70 – $1.90 levels. According to a popular analyst on the social media platform X, this slight inactivity might be a bullish signal of what is to come over the next few weeks. Is SUI On The Verge Of A 30% Surge? In a January 18 post on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared an interesting chart setup for the SUI price. According to the market pundit, a break out of the current chart setup could see the altcoin reach the $2.29 level over the coming weeks. Related Reading: Dogecoin RSI Just Entered Historical Oversold Levels Again, Will It Repeat 2021? The rationale behind this positive prediction is the formation of a bull flag pattern on the 4-hour timeframe of the Bitcoin price chart. The bull flag is a technical analysis pattern characterized by a period of steep upward movement (the flagpole) typically followed by sideways or slightly downward price action. Typically, the bull flag functions as a prevailing continuation pattern for an existing upward trend, suggesting a potential move to a higher price point. While this chart is often a bullish signal, it is crucial to wait for a successful breach of the upper boundary of the consolidation range; this increases the odds that the price will continue in its upward trajectory. As shown in the chart above, the price level that needs to be broken to confirm the uptrend continuation lies around the $1.84 mark. Meanwhile, the target for this chart pattern is usually calculated by adding the vertical height of the flagpole to the potential breakout point from the flag. According to Martinez, a sustained break above this level could see the SUI price run up to as $2.29, representing an almost 30% surge from the current price point. SUI Price Overview As of this writing, the price of SUI stands at around $1.78, reflecting a mere 0.9% dip in the past 24 hours. This tame daily action highlights the indecisiveness currently affecting this altcoin market, as the SUI bulls and bears battled for dominance over the past week. According to CoinGecko data, the altcoin’s value is down by 1.7% in the last seven days. However, this past week’s struggles have not been enough to wipe out SUI’s recent success, especially on broader timeframes. For instance, the altcoin’s value has increased by more than 28% on the monthly timeframe. With this positive performance, the token has maintained a position within the top 30 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap.
