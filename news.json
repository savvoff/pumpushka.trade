    "title": "Why The Bitcoin Price Could Crash Another 20% To $76,000 Soon",
    "body": "The Bitcoin price could be in for more pain as a crypto analyst has just released a gloomy short-term outlook, warning that another crash may be on the way. The analyst believes that Bitcoin’s overall market structure remains bearish. As a result, he expects the price to fall to about $76,000, representing a 20% decline from current levels. Bitcoin Price At Risk Of 20% Crash Crypto market analyst Roman has issued a warning that Bitcoin could be heading for another sharp decline, with his primary target set near $76,000. In his post on X, he emphasized that the current market structure shows no evidence of a sustainable price bottom and that downside risk remains dominant. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To Crash Another 50% As Analyst Marks $40,000 Bottom Target Roman explained that his bearish outlook is based on the daily timeframe, where Bitcoin has struggled to regain strong bullish momentum after a significant correction. He also noted that the price is still trading within a broader bearish trend, suggesting the market may simply be taking a pause before the next move lower. The accompanying chart shows BTC trading above $90,000 while still well below the previous resistance area near $96,000. Each attempt to push higher has been rejected, suggesting sellers remain firmly in control of the market. Notably, Roman’s chart has revealed that the expected move lower could start with a drop back to the mid $80,000s, followed by a deeper slide between $78,500 and $75,000. The hand-drawn projection on the chart also illustrates a sharp fall after a brief relief rally, suggesting that BTC’s decline could speed up once support breaks. Volume behavior also plays a key role in Roman’s bearish outlook. The chart shows noticeably weak trading volume during Bitcoin’s recent rebound, which the analyst previously said is typical of holiday-driven pumps. Additional Signals That Support Analyst’s Bearish Forecast Roman’s $76,000 Bitcoin crash forecast is a follow-up to previous posts in which he explained several reasons why the leading cryptocurrency is in a bear market and could correct again soon. He referenced historical indicator behavior to justify his latest prediction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $25,000: Why The Bottom Is Much Lower The analyst explained that Bitcoin’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) were extremely oversold after its price dropped roughly 40% from its all-time high. As a result, the current consolidation has given these indicators a chance to reset. Roman sees the lack of strong buying pressure during this reset as a warning sign. He stressed that a true bullish reversal would need rising volume and clear higher highs, which are not showing on the daily chart. The analyst also noted that Bitcoin’s longer-term trend remains bearish, with the market continuing to form lower highs within a declining range. He has concluded that until clear reversal signals appear, traders should treat any upside moves as corrective, not the start of a fresh bull run.

    "title": "Cathie Wood: Trump May Buy Bitcoin For US Reserve Ahead Of Midterms",
    "body": "Cathie Wood, ARK Invest’s founder and CEO, said she expects the Trump administration could move beyond simply holding seized bitcoin and begin purchasing BTC to build a US strategic reserve, a shift she argued could become a catalytic signal for markets and other governments. Speaking on ARK’s “Bitcoin Brainstorm” podcast in an episode dated Jan. 08, Wood framed government buying as a potential inflection point at a time when she believes institutional participation remains “just beginning” and bitcoin’s supply dynamics are getting harder to ignore. “We have seen very little institutional buy-in, it is just beginning,” Wood said. “And I think if we get the US, for example, not adding just confiscated bitcoin to a strategic reserve but, you know, out there buying, and we don’t know if that’s going to be the case. But if they were to do so, I have a feeling that would set off what we’re all waiting for, which is, you know, the scarcity value to reassert itself again now that we’re near 20 million bitcoin outstanding and we only have one more million to go.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Emerges As A Hedge Amid Rising Global Geopolitical Tensions In the discussion, Wood suggested the administration’s posture so far has effectively been limited to confiscated holdings. She contrasted that with what she described as an earlier ambition for scale, noting “the original intent was to own a million bitcoin,” before adding her view that a pivot toward purchases is plausible. Midterms Could Drive US Bitcoin Reserve Buys Wood linked that possibility to political incentives heading into the 2026 US midterm elections, describing Trump as motivated to keep momentum and avoid being politically sidelined. “President Trump does not want to be a lame duck,” she said. “So I have a feeling that he is going to work with his crypto and AI czar to do a few things… [and] it seems as though there’s been reticence about actually buying bitcoin for the strategic reserve. So far, so far it’s confiscated… So I actually think they will start buying.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator With 84% Hit Rate Flashes Again: Is A Price Rally Next? Wood also pointed to what she sees as aligned constituencies around the president, arguing he has “all kinds of reasons” to lean into crypto while emphasizing that the political calculus matters because of the midterm timeline. When the conversation turned to how such purchases could be executed, Wood echoed the idea that any reserve strategy would need to be budget-neutral. She didn’t outline a mechanism, but treated the constraint as a key gating factor for feasibility. Wood argued that explicit US buying would not just be a domestic market event. Iit could force other capitals to revisit reserve policy. “Something that’s really important… we thought that countries would adopt it much earlier than they have,” she said. “I think if the US actually says, ‘Okay, now we’re going to buy,’ that’s going to spur a lot of other governments to think this thing through. Do they want to be hostage to the dollar…? And you know, no, they don’t. So put some bitcoin in your reserves.” If that dynamic accelerates, Wood warned emerging-market currencies could face renewed pressure, describing a scenario where reserve diversification toward bitcoin reshapes volatility across weaker fiat regimes, a downstream effect, she suggested, of Washington making the first overt move from holding seized BTC to competing in the open market. At press time, BTC traded at $90,578. Featured image from YouTube, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Wall Street Analyst Is Still Bullish On Bitcoin, Predicts Price Recovery",
    "body": "As the market remains divided on Bitcoin’s (BTC) near-term direction, one Wall Street analyst is standing firm in his bullish outlook. He predicts that Bitcoin could soon enter a price discovery, underscoring its value beyond being a payment currency to a market leader and one of the best-performing assets that could eventually reach gold’s market capitalization. Analyst Stays Bullish On Bitcoin Despite Price Instability In a recent interview with CNBC, William Blair’s fintech equity analyst Andrew Jeffrey said recent price swings do not change his long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s recovery and future value. CNBC opened the discussion by pointing out that crypto started the year on a stronger note than Q4 2025, rising about 5% before giving back more than 2% after a sharp rally. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Strongest XRP Price Rally In History Is Coming, Here’s Why When asked what was happening beneath the surface of Bitcoin’s latest moves, Jeffrey said its behavior reflects the nature of an immature asset. He explained that BTC has a market capitalization of more than $1.9 trillion. Yet, roughly one-third of the total supply is controlled by a small group of wallets, roughly estimated at 2 million. The Wall Street analyst stated that this supply concentration creates instability, especially during periods of market stress. He added that recent buyers, particularly retail investors entering through ETFs, tend to have weaker conviction and are more likely to sell during downturns. According to Jeffrey, these sell-offs can feed on themselves, leading to sharper declines. He said the current environment is broadly risk off, but emphasized that he sees this phase as temporary. The Wall Street analyst also highlighted his belief that Bitcoin will increasingly be viewed as a store of value. He stated that BTC could eventually challenge gold’s role in that category and move closer to the precious metal’s market cap, which is currently about 15x larger than Bitcoin’s today. While optimistic about Bitcoin’s outlook, Jeffrey made it clear that he does not see it becoming a dominant payment tool. Instead, he stated that stablecoins like Circle’s USDC are more suited for transactions. The analyst emphasized that price discovery is still underway and that BTC’s long-term potential remains intact despite recent market turbulence. Bitcoin Still Needs To Lead For Crypto To Rise In the interview, Jeffrey spoke with CNBC about fading excitement around Bitcoin as newer crypto stories attract attention. CNBC raised concerns that BTC feels like old news as prices hover and interest shifts towards more interesting news surrounding companies like Ripple. Related Reading: XRP Mirrors Gold’s Trajectory: What A Similar ATH Rally Would Mean Jeffrey replied that Bitcoin’s short-term price action is driven by investor psychology, while its long-term performance tells a different story. He highlighted that Bitcoin has been the best-performing asset in the world over the past decade and said investors need to maintain that perspective. CNBC also questioned whether crypto growth could now occur without Bitcoin leading the way. The Wall Street analyst responded that it would be very hard for the crypto market to see sustained gains without BTC at the forefront.

    "title": "Analyst Breaks Down Why Investors will Make More Money With XRP Than Bitcoin",
    "body": "A crypto market participant has outlined a numerical comparison showing how the same investment amount could generate significantly different returns depending on whether it is placed into Bitcoin or XRP. The projection, which was shared on X and focuses on price levels and capital growth, shows how XRP has a better upside on a percentage basis compared to Bitcoin at its current valuations. How The Numbers Favor XRP Over Bitcoin The comparison starts with a $5,000 investment. At current prices, Bitcoin would need to rise to around $180,000 for that initial $5,000 investment to double to $10,000. Interestingly, multiple bullish predictions put Bitcoin reaching a price target of at least $180,000 in the next few months, so this is most likely a guarantee. However, Bitcoin’s position as the largest cryptocurrency works as both an advantage and a constraint. Related Reading: XRP Retrace Is Only Temporary, What Happens Once the Uptrend Resumes At the time of writing, Bitcoin has a large market cap of $1.8 trillion. Given Bitcoin’s already large market cap, any move of notable magnitude requires huge capital inflows over an extended period of time. Its recent adoption among institutional traders and role as the largest cryptocurrency provide stability, but its size limits how quickly it can multiply in value. Each incremental gain requires increasingly larger amounts of new capital entering the market. On the other hand, XRP has a much smaller market cap of $128 billion. Using the same $5,000 investment in XRP produces a much different outcome under the analyst’s assumptions. If XRP reaches a $10 price level, the value of that position would rise to $25,000. Therefore, this means that, as it stands, XRP has a much better profit potential than Bitcoin. The argument presented is not that Bitcoin lacks upside, but that the capital efficiency of XRP is higher if both assets move to commonly cited bullish targets. Risk Profiles And Return Expectations The difference in projection also shows different risk tolerances of both cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is more appealing to investors who prioritize long-term exposure and relative stability. Predictions for Bitcoin range from $150,000 all the way to above $1 million. Related Reading: XRP Price Mirrors 2017 Sideways Accumulation Trend – Here’s What Happened Last Time XRP, on the other hand, will attract traders who are willing to accept higher volatility in exchange for the possibility of larger returns. The cryptocurrency has been the subject of numerous bullish projections from analysts due to the growing optimism around its role in financial institutions and the recent exposure through Spot XRP ETFs. The bullish sentiment is so strong that a few analysts are already projecting how XRP has the potential to trade at $100 in the next few years. One analyst, for example, noted that XRP has the potential to reach $100 before Bitcoin reaches $1 million and that it can even hit $1,000 before Bitcoin hits $19 million.

    "body": "Solana is undergoing a major shift as big institutional players are increasingly positioning in the network. What was once viewed primarily as a high-performance Layer-1 driven by retail and developer enthusiasm is now attracting serious capital allocations from professional funds, asset managers, and institutional allocators. This trend bolsters the SOL accumulation thesis as an emerging institutional liquidity and infrastructure story. Why Big Capital Begins Positioning Into Solana In an X post, Rex reported that the latest wave of institutional interest in Solana confirms what analyst Solana Sensei pointed out, that big firms are actively accumulating SOL right now. Forward Industry alone is holding close to $1 billion worth of SOL, while firms like Defidevcorp and others are sitting on hundreds of millions. Related Reading: Solana’s Network Performance Reaches Historic Peaks As Transaction Activity Climbs Rex views this move as just the start, and SOL stands out when it comes to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Its insane transaction speed, combined with dirt-cheap fees and real scalability, finally makes moving real assets on-chain viable and sustainable. These projects choosing SOL isn’t accidental; they know where the future is heading. The expert also reflects on the journey. SOL has been addressed as fast but too centralized. Currently, the same institutions that once stayed on the sidelines are quietly stacking billions in SOL, while the real run hasn’t even started yet. SOL is positioning itself to reach levels that may look unimaginable in the next few years. “Supper proud to be part of this,” Rex noted. While the crowd stayed focused on the 2025 volatility, an analyst known as Senior highlighted that Solana entered 2026 by finally delivering on its biggest technical promise. The Firedancer validator client officially went live on mainnet as of January 2026, pushing the network’s finality to 150 milliseconds and finally ending years of beta resilience and performance concerns. At the same time, Western Union officially integrated the SOL network. Meanwhile, the Spot SOL ETF surpassed $1 billion in total net assets this week, indicating that the infrastructure has also reached true institutional-grade standards. In the past, the moment SOL transitions from a retail playground to a permanent global financial rail, becoming unshakeable will feel obvious. On-Chain Activity Reflects Real Usage Growth The Solana metrics are growing. Investor and founder of the Inner Circle, Lark Davis, has revealed that the SOL application revenue surged to $2.39 billion, a 46% year-over-year increase and a new all-time high in 2025. SOL network revenue also reached $1.48 billion, representing a 48 times increase over the past two years. Meanwhile, daily active wallets have climbed to 3.2 million, showing that SOL growth is improving. Related Reading: Why Has The Solana Price Been In A Steady Downtrend Since January? On January 6th, nearly $900 million in stablecoin supply entered the SOL ecosystem in a single day. Currently, SOL leads all chains in both 24-hour and 30-day DEX volumes, and has emerged as the top blockchain by market capitalization for tokenized stocks.

    "title": "Bitcoin Risks Drop To $69,000 If Pennant Support Breaks, Analyst Warns",
    "body": "A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how Bitcoin could risk a crash to $69,230 if the support level of this Bear Pennant doesn’t hold up. Bitcoin Might Need To Hold Above $87,200 In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a support level that BTC might have to hold in order to avoid a steep drop. The level in question is the lower line of a Bear Pennant. A Pennant is a pattern from technical analysis (TA) that’s similar to a Flag. Both of these patterns are characterized by an initial sharp move (commonly known as the “pole”) and a subsequent phase of consolidation. But unlike Flags, which involve a parallel consolidation channel, Pennants involve a triangular channel instead. Related Reading: $460M Crypto Longs Squeezed As Bitcoin Slips Below $90,000 When the price is trading inside the consolidation portion of the Pennant, it encounters resistance at the upper line and support at the lower one. A breakout of either of these levels may signal a sustained move in that direction. Pennants are generally considered to be continuation patterns, so a move may be more likely to take place in the same direction as the pole. In a Bear Pennant, the pole is represented by a downward move, implying that a bearish continuation could succeed the pattern. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Bear Pennant that Bitcoin has been trading inside on the daily timeframe over the last couple of months: As displayed in the above graph, Bitcoin retested the upper line of the Pennant’s consolidation region when its price surged above $94,000. This retest ended up in rejection, and the coin has since retraced to lower levels. If the current trajectory in the cryptocurrency continues, it’s possible that a retest of the support level could take place, which is situated around $87,200. Since the pattern involved here is a Bear Pennant, BTC failing a retest of this line could signal a bearish breakout. Pennant breakouts are usually considered to lead to a move that’s similar to the pole in length. Based on this, BTC’s breakout target from the current pattern could lie near $69,000. “Bitcoin $BTC must hold above $87,200 to avoid a drop toward $69,230,” explained the analyst. Bitcoin is currently also trading near an important on-chain level: the Active Realized Price. This indicator keeps track of the average cost basis of the active network participants. According to data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the Active Realized Price is located at $87,700 right now, meaning that the active investors are in a slight amount of net profit.

    "body": "The notorious crypto crash on October 10 of last year sent shockwaves through the market, resulting in the largest liquidation event in history with nearly $20 billion in losses. This catastrophic event ignited significant criticisms and fears among investors regarding the stability of the cryptocurrency market. However, the upcoming crypto market structure bill, known as the CLARITY Act, is being touted as a potential safeguard against future crashes. Market Manipulation In Crypto Could Plummet Market expert Crypto Rover recently took to social media to express optimism about the CLARITY Act as the Senate prepares for a markup on January 15. According to Rover, this crypto bill could reduce market manipulation in the crypto space by an impressive 70% to 80%. Related Reading: 3 Vital Factors Needed For A Lasting 2026 Crypto Surge, Bitwise CIO Unveils He noted the devastating effects of the October 10 event, describing it as a “massacre” for crypto holders, many of whom lost their life savings without clear answers about who was ultimately responsible for the chaos. Rover is confident that with the implementation of the CLARITY Act, the cryptocurrency market could begin operating more like traditional financial markets (TradFi). Institutional Investment Set To Surge Once the CLARITY Act passes in the Senate, Rover asserts that it will move to the floor for a full vote before returning to the House for final approval and eventually reaching President Trump’s desk. He further suggested that this entire process could take one to two months, potentially allowing the CLARITY Act to be signed into law by March 2026.

This comes amid a positive increase in net flows, indicating that more coins are flowing into exchanges, likely to offload them. SHIB Price At Risk With 82 Trillion Shiba Inu On Exchanges CryptoQuant data shows that the Shiba Inu exchange reserve is at 82 trillion coins. This indicates higher selling pressure, especially as the value has risen from around 81 trillion at the start of the year. Amid this development, the SHIB price has trimmed some of its year-to-date gains, with the meme coin dropping from a high above $0.000009 just as the exchange reserve rose. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Shiba Inu Price Jumped Over 13% Another bearish indicator for Shiba Inu at the moment is the exchange netflow. Further data from CryptoQuant show that the exchange netflow has turned positive, indicating that more coins are being deposited into exchanges than removed. As such, the meme coin is likely currently facing more selling pressure than buying pressure, putting the SHIB price at risk of a decline. Notably, the Shiba Inu exchange netflow turned positive just as the SHIB price reached its yearly high above $$0.000009. The recent bearish sentiment in the broader crypto market has likely contributed to these sell-offs for SHIB, with the Bitcoin price dropping back to $90,000 after rising above $94,000 at the start of the year. Activity in the Shiba Inu derivatives market also paints a bearish picture for the SHIB price. CoinGlass data shows that trading volume has dropped by just over 5%, to $203 million. SHIB’s open interest is also down over 7%, dropping to $108 million. However, a positive is that most traders are still bullish on the meme coin, with the long/short ratio above 1. An Increase In SHIB Whale Transactions A positive for the SHIB price is that whales still appear to be bullish on the meme coin. On-chain analytics platform Santiment recently pointed out a 111% spike in Shiba Inu’s whale transactions. Thanks to this development, SHIB ranks among the tokens with a market cap of at least $500 that have seen an increase in whale transactions above $100,000. Related Reading: Shiba Inu End Of Year Predictions Remain Bearish, High Volatility Expected Meanwhile, CryptoQuant data show that the number of daily Shiba Inu active addresses has climbed since the start of the year and has remained above the 3,000 threshold. This is a positive as it indicates that attention is now returning to the SHIB ecosystem, which could positively impact the SHIB price once the crypto market rebounds again. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.000008752, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "body": "Ripple’s 2025 acquisition spree is starting to look, in the eyes of Digital Ascension Group CEO Jake Claver, less like opportunistic dealmaking and more like an attempt to build the “Amazon of financial infrastructure,” a vertically integrated stack where XRP and Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD sit at the settlement layer. In a video, Claver said Ripple spent roughly $2.45 billion on acquisitions in the last seven months of 2025, arguing the purchases form “pillars for a master plan” that mirrors how Amazon built dominance by owning infrastructure rather than just selling products. Why Ripple Could Be The ‘Next Amazon’ The core analogy was explicit. “Amazon’s success came from building infrastructure, not just from self products,” Claver said. “You got AWS. It became the most profitable piece of their business. That was infrastructure. They own all of the warehouses and logistics and the cloud and the marketplace.” Related Reading: How XRP Ledger Becomes The Leading Blockchain In 2026: Fintech CEO His contention is that infrastructure plays create structural advantages: lower marginal costs, faster iteration, and higher switching costs once institutions integrate. “This vertical integration is rare in financial services,” he said, arguing that most firms “specialize in one layer or partner for the rest,” which introduces friction, delays, and blame-shifting when systems fail. He also claimed the endgame resembles “winner take all dynamics,” where “network effects make the large networks exponentially more valuable than small ones” and “switching becomes cost prohibitive” once workflows are embedded. To explain the Amazon comparison, Claver mapped Ripple’s 2025 deals to what he sees as the minimum viable infrastructure bundle for an institutional “platform.” “You need custody and clearing for assets. You need treasury management for corporate operations. You need payment rails that work globally 24/7, 365,” he said. “You need a stable coin infrastructure for efficient settlements. And you need settlement assets to be able to move between all of those.” He argued Ripple has assembled those layers through a mix of older buys and 2025 mega-deals, culminating in what he called an end-to-end institutional product branded “Ripple 1.” The most prominent 2025 move, Claver said, was the $1.25 billion purchase of Hidden Road in April, now rebranded “Ripple Prime.” His framing: prime brokerage is the institutional “plumbing” that makes large-scale trading and settlement possible. “Prime brokers provide the behind-the-scenes services that make institutional trading possible,” he said. “They handle clearing. They make sure trade actually settles between counterparties. They provide custody and hold assets securely.” He added that Hidden Road served “over 300 institutional clients” and cleared “more than $3 trillion” in 2024, and claimed the business has grown “3x” since the acquisition announcement. Related Reading: XRP Retrace Is Only Temporary, What Happens Once the Uptrend Resumes He also pointed to an integration hook meant to create internal demand for Ripple’s stablecoin: “Hidden Road will use RLUSD as collateral across prime brokerage products. And this creates organic demand for Ripple stablecoin with institutional adoption.” The second pillar, he said, was Rail, acquired for about $200 million in August 2025, described as a stablecoin payments platform that operates 24/7 and reduces the need for enterprises to hold crypto directly. He claimed Rail was forecast to process “over 10%” of a $36 billion global B2B stablecoin payments market in 2025. Third came GTreasury, acquired for $1 billion after being announced in October 2025 and closing in December, which Claver described as treasury software used by large corporations and processing $12.5 trillion in annual payment volume. The strategic value, he argued, is distribution: access to CFOs and treasurers via trusted software already embedded in corporate finance workflows. The fourth, Palisade, announced in November 2025 with undisclosed terms, was framed as the “hot wallet” layer: operational wallet-as-a-service infrastructure for high-velocity transaction use cases, complementing deeper custody solutions. At press time, XRP traded at $2.10. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Ethereum’s Long Accumulation Nears Completion While ETH/BTC Holds The Line",
    "body": "Ethereum continues to trade within a prolonged accumulation phase, signaling that the market may be approaching a pivotal transition. As ETH/BTC firmly defends long-term cycle support, the structure points to quiet strength building beneath the surface, often a precursor to rotation and a decisive next move. Ethereum’s Inverted Monthly Chart Signals Late-Stage Accumulation EGRAG CRYPTO made a post, showing that Ethereum’s inverted monthly chart continues to reflect a familiar cyclical pattern, though with notable evolution. Each market cycle follows a similar rhythm, but as the asset matures, volatility compresses, and price behavior becomes more controlled. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Q1 Outlook: Analyst Shares Historical Setup As Price Nears Key Resistance In the first cycle, Ethereum experienced a brief accumulation phase followed by a sharp and violent drop. The second cycle extended the accumulation period, resulting in a more gradual decline. Meanwhile, in the third and current cycle, accumulation has lasted significantly longer, suggesting that any corrective phase should be comparatively shallow. It is important to note that the chart is inverted, meaning what appears as a drop on this view actually represents a breakout on the standard price chart. In this context, the current structure suggests that accumulation is nearing completion, and the market may be approaching its next decisive move. This setup points to a less explosive move compared to earlier cycles, but more controlled. From a price roadmap perspective, initial resistance is projected between $3,800 and $4,500. A successful flip of that zone into support could open the door toward the $6,000 to $7,500 region. The primary risk scenario remains a deeper retest toward the $1,800 to $2,200 range before a broader upside continuation. Why ETH/BTC Is A Key Market Barometer Right Now In a recent post on ETH/BTC, CyrilXBT emphasized that this remains one of the most important charts to monitor. Ethereum continues to defend the 2018 cycle support, consistently printing higher lows while price action tightens just below key resistance levels. This kind of compression often signals that the market is preparing for a larger move rather than breaking down. Related Reading: Here’s The Ethereum Descending Triangle Structure That Threatens A Crash Below $2,800 Importantly, there is no sign of panic or structural damage. Sellers have failed to force a decisive breakdown, while buyers continue to step in at higher levels, reinforcing the strength of the underlying support. The longer this base holds, the more meaningful the eventual breakout or rotation becomes. At this stage of the cycle, Ethereum does not need to outperform aggressively. Simply holding its relative value is usually enough to signal the early stages of capital rotation. Historically, sustained stability on the ETH/BTC pair tends to precede periods where Ethereum begins to take the lead once momentum fully returns.
