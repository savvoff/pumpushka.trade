    "title": "Ethereum Price Is Not Going To Keep Falling Forever, Analyst Says",
    "body": "Ethereum’s recent sell-off has weighed heavily on sentiment after the price fell below the $2,000 level and pulled much of the altcoin market lower alongside it. The move has caused sweeping fear and caution among Ethereum traders. However, some analysts are of the notion that a bullish upside will roll in soon. In a post shared on X, crypto analyst ChainHub said the current conditions point more toward exhaustion, and after massive downside comes massive upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Edges Past Gold In Appeal, JPMorgan Says ETHBTC Structure Holds ChainHub emphasized that the ETH/BTC pair is still technically valid and has not seen any structural invalidation despite the recent price crash. Although Ethereum’s price fell much lower than many expected during the crash, it is not going to keep falling forever. He also pointed to fear levels that are now climbing to extremes rarely seen, noting that such environments always tend to appear near major turning points. “After massive fear and massive downside comes massive upside,” the analyst said. On Ethereum itself, ChainHub acknowledged that losing the $2,000 handle was important, but he highlighted the next major area of interest near $1,700. This zone is technically consistent with a broader corrective structure, and it is possible that Ethereum might not even fall that far before it rebounds. However, even if Ethereum does fall to $1,700, price action reaching this area means Ethereum is finally at a region where buyers may begin to reassert control. He linked this outlook to Bitcoin’s recent behavior. Bitcoin’s rejection at $72,000 opened the door to a retest of the upper portion of its summer 2024 demand range, which stretches from around $59,000 down to $49,000. ChainHub pointed out that this is the first significant interaction with that demand area since 2025, with Fibonacci alignment clustering around $57,000 to $58,000. This increases the odds that Bitcoin is in the process of forming a base, and that is where it establishes a bottom. Altcoins Touching Meaningful Demand Levels ChainHub also noted that Ethereum is not alone in testing critical levels. Several major altcoins, including Solana and XRP, have moved into important demand zones. Many of these altcoins have revisited August 2024 lows or filled prior wicks, areas that have not yet been broken on an initial attempt. Solana, for instance, has broken below $100 for the first time since January 2024 and recently traded at a low of $75. As noted by ChainHub, this move saw Solana finally touch meaningful demand for the first time in 2 years.

Although there is still the possibility for limited downside, the expectation is that the market begins forming a range and then starts building bullish momentum in the coming weeks.

    "title": "XRP Price Has Just Reached Most Oversold Level In History And This Analyst Is Predicting A Bounce",
    "body": "The XRP price has hit oversold levels, marking its lowest readings in history. A crypto analyst has reported that each time XRP has reached these levels, a price bounce has followed. Based on this, he believes that XRP could be on the verge of another major rebound, projecting a potential rally above $2. XRP Price Sinks To Oversold Levels Ahead Of Rebound A crypto market analyst known as ‘Ripple Bull Winkle’ on X has outlined a short-term bullish outlook for XRP. Despite consistently breaking key support levels and now trading around $1.4, the analyst argues that XRP may be positioning itself for a substantial recovery that could ultimately push its price back above $2. Related Reading: Pundit Says XRP Price Is Not A ‘Crypto’ Question, But A Systemically Important Liquidity Asset The basis for Ripple Bull Winkle’s optimism stems from a recurring historical pattern that, in his view, has never failed to produce a bounce in the XRP price. Specifically, the analyst highlights a repeating Relative Strength Index (RSI) pattern. He announced that XRP recently reached an RSI of 20 on the daily chart, marking the most oversold reading in its history. According to the analyst, every time XRP has entered similarly extreme oversold territory, a price bounce of approximately 15-40% has always followed. He said such rebounds typically occur within two weeks of reaching these levels. He also emphasized that this recovery has not happened occasionally but consistently, reinforcing his confidence that XRP is likely to follow the same pattern and bounce again. If everything plays out as expected, Ripple Bull Winkle projects that XRP could see a relief bounce to $2.20-$2.50 before the end of February 2026. He noted that a rally to this bullish target is the highest-probability event the market has had this year. Analyst Shares Multiple Resistance Targets For XRP Looking at Ripple Bull Winkle’s accompanying price chart, he has marked several key resistance zones using red horizontal lines, indicating areas where XRP may encounter selling pressure or struggle to advance. These levels range from approximately $1.8-$1.91 to $2.06-$2.19, followed by $2.29-$2.41, $2.67-$2.78, and a higher resistance band near $3.10-$3.18.

The upward-pointing blue arrows in the chart also signal the analyst’s expectation of a bullish breakout or a sustained rally toward the stacked resistance levels if XRP builds enough momentum. As of writing, XRP appears to be recovering from its recent downtrend. Its price has rebounded by more than 10% over the past 24 hours and is currently trading above $1.4 after briefly dipping below $1.3, according to CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "Ethereum’s Funding Rates Signal Sentiment Flip Across Major Exchanges",
    "body": "Ethereum (ETH) has declined noticeably over the past week, with price data from CoinMarketCap reporting a net 14% decline within this period. At the time of the most recent data, ETH is trading around $2,000, significantly lower than the past week’s level near $2,500. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Is Not Going To Keep Falling Forever, Analyst Says ETH Funding Rates Signal A Bullish Turn In a QuickTake post on the CryptoQuant platform, analyst Amr Taha draws attention to recent developments in ETH funding rates, a key sentiment indicator in perpetual futures. The funding rate shows the market sentiment, whether it’s optimistic/greedy (positive) or fearful/cautious (negative). Typically, when funding is highly positive or negative, it means that too many traders are on one side, positions are overleveraged, and then the market becomes unstable. At that point, even a small price move in the opposite direction can trigger liquidations, causing sharp and fast price moves. Although Ethereum’s funding rate was deeply negative over the week, analyst Amr Taha noted there has been a flip as ETH derivatives data shows a clear shift toward bullish positioning. Notably, Funding rates have turned strongly positive on BitMEX (Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange), reaching 0.049%, their highest level since October and well above the previous peak near 0.03. This signals aggressive leverage on the long side. Related Reading: XRP Price Has Just Reached Most Oversold Level In History And This Analyst Is Predicting A Bounce Extreme Optimism In ETH Could Spark Sharp Moves At the same time, ETH funding on Binance has moved from deeply negative levels at -0.025% on February 5 back towards neutral, indicating that short positions are being replaced by new long exposure. In essence, the market has moved from fear to optimism. While this shift reflects a rise in bullish sentiments, history shows that periods of extreme positive funding driven by leverage often increase the risk of liquidations and sharp corrective moves, rather than supporting sustained upside. In short, when everyone is bullish at the same time, the market becomes easier to knock over. In all, Ethereum Derivatives traders have become aggressively bullish, and while that can push price higher in the short term, history shows it often increases the risk of sudden corrective moves rather than a sustained uptrend. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,089 after a 14.9% decline in the past seven days. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is down by 32.39% and valued at $37.39 billion.

    "title": "Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio Sinks To Historical Lows — Accumulation Next?",
    "body": "Since reaching its current all-time-high price of $126,000 in October last year, the Bitcoin market has been on a sell-off, translating into surmounting bear pressure. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency has maintained a steady decline, falling until it recently reached $60,000 — a deviation of more than 52% from its all-time high. Bitcoin currently seems to be seeing a rebound, but price action alone reflects that it could as well be one of its short-term recoveries. Interestingly, a recent on-chain evaluation suggests that the current upward movement may be driven by a significant underlying metric. Related Reading: Bitcoin Taker Buy Ratio Signals Peak Bearish Sentiment — Relief Soon? What The Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio Is Saying In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, Darkfost reveals that the Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio is now at a zone historically relevant to the ends of bear markets. The Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted performance metric that measures how much return an asset (Bitcoin, in this case) generates for risk taken. A high ratio signals that returns are strong in relation to risks taken; a declining ratio, on the other hand, reflects weakening returns, while risk remains elevated. On the severe end of the metric, a very low or negative Sharpe Ratio is a sign that market participants are taking very high risks for poor or negative returns. It is worth noting that very low Sharpe ratios are frequently seen during deep bear markets or even capitulation phases. According to historical data, Darkfost explains that the Sharpe Ratio is currently at a level so low as to be reminiscent of the final phases of past bear markets. This means that the Bitcoin price holds a higher practical risk, compared to returns, for current investors. Notably, the Sharpe ratio is not just at a low point, but continues in a steady state of decline. This, according to the market quant, is a sign that Bitcoin’s performance is yet to be attractive to any willing risk-taker. However, it is this specific dynamic that sets the pace for a turnaround in Bitcoin’s price. This is because sustained poor returns typically force capitulation events, where weaker hands are flushed out; this eventually sets the stage for renewed accumulation among stronger hands. Related Reading: Forget A Bitcoin Yearly Top, BTC Price Might Have Hit A 16-Year Cyclical Peak Two Main Approaches To Consider In This Scenario: Analyst Seeing as the current market condition is still mostly uncertain, Darkfost offers two ways to engage the current scenario. First, the analyst states that investors could begin increasing exposure gradually, and in line with the ratio’s movement towards lower risk zones. Second, Darkfost explains that a market participant could decide to wait for clear improvements in the Sharpe Ratio before entering the market at all. This is to serve as a confirmation strategy for the purpose of investor safety. However, Darkfost notes that the present bear phase could last a couple more months before any true reversal is seen, regardless of the signal being flashed by the Sharpe Ratio. As of this writing, Bitcoin stands at a $69,064 valuation. CoinMarketCap data reflects a 1.71% loss over the past day. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview",

    "title": "XRP Funding Rate Drops To Lowest Level Since April 2025 — What This Means",
    "body": "The price of XRP has shown a sheer amount of resilience after a couple of red days for the general crypto market. The altcoin has managed to return to around $1.5 over the weekend, reflecting a nearly 25% jump since reaching its latest local low. However, this fresh burst of momentum seems to be just that, a short-lived moment of positivity that might not translate to the long-term trajectory. According to the latest on-chain data, the XRP price might still be tilting more towards the bearish side of the market. Low Funding Rate Signals Reduced Appetite In Derivatives Market In a recent Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, Arab Chain revealed that belief might be increasingly exiting the XRP derivatives market. This on-chain observation is based on changes in the funding rates on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Related Reading: Forget A Bitcoin Yearly Top, BTC Price Might Have Hit A 16-Year Cyclical Peak For context, the “funding rate” metric estimates the periodic fee exchanged between traders in the derivatives market of a particular cryptocurrency. A positive funding rate often signals that the long traders (investors with buy positions) are paying a fee to short traders (investors with sell positions) in the derivatives market, while a low funding rate metric implies that the payment is the other way round. As shown in the chart above, the XRP funding rate on Binance has been in a notable decline over the past few days, recently dropping to around -0.028, reflecting its lowest level since April 2025. According to Arab Chain, this shift signals a clear move toward defensive positioning and hedging against further downside. The on-chain analyst revealed that a deeply negative funding rate shows the level of pessimism in the market, as traders are more willing to pay a premium to hold short positions. This trend is even more damaging, considering the decline seen by the XRP price in the past few weeks. Arab Chain wrote in the Quicktake post: Historically, funding rates reaching extreme negative levels often coincide with advanced stages of downtrends, when a large portion of traders are already positioned short. While low funding rates have sometimes set the stage for temporary rebounds triggered by a return of speculative demand, they often reflect heightened caution and reduced risk appetite in the market. Nevertheless, this funding rate level also suggests that any uptick in sentiment could catalyse “faster-than-expected” price moves. XRP Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of XRP stands at around $1.44, reflecting an over 1% decline in the past 24 hours.
