    "title": "$2,500 Solana? Scaramucci Says The Setup Is Already In Motion",
    "body": "SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci said he still sees a path to Solana reaching $2,500 over a five-to-ten-year horizon, arguing that tokenization plus clearer US regulation could turn Solana into a core financial “rail system.” Scaramucci made the remarks in an interview with SolanaFloor filmed during last week’s Solana Breakpoint conference and released on Dec. 18. Why Solana Is Still Poised For $2,500 Scaramucci framed the $2,500 thesis as a long-duration bet that won’t play out cleanly. “It’s not going to come without… volatility,” he said, pointing to what he called a messy US regulatory year and sticky inflation as headwinds that “probably slowed down our trajectory.” “If you had asked me at the beginning of the year” whether Washington would pass stablecoin legislation and “the market structure, the CLARITY bill,” he said he would have expected both. “That did not happen.” Still, he argued “the timing is still right,” with the caveat that price will likely remain jumpy until those macro and regulatory variables resolve. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Support Shattered, Potential $100 Test Looms, Says Analyst To explain the patience required, Scaramucci leaned on a tech-investing analogy, recalling Amazon’s drawdowns by 90% before mass adoption. The lesson, in his words: stay with “great technology” through uncertain stretches because durable infrastructure eventually gets adopted. Asked what surprised him most this cycle, Scaramucci singled out the Trump and Melania memecoins. He described their Solana launch as “a compliment to Solana” because it was selected for “ability to handle large scale large volume transactions with great certainty and finality.” But he also argued the episode backfired on policy. “I think those coins slowed down the regulatory process in the US,” he said, suggesting that the optics of a US president entering the memecoin business created a political “foil” that opponents could use to resist crypto bills. “I think we would have gotten everything that we wanted this year had the president sort of stayed out of the meme coin business,” he added, calling it “short-term regulatory” damage. He also claimed the memecoin surge “sucked out all the liquidity from a lot of the altcoins,” which he said “hurt the industry,” even as it showcased Solana’s throughput. Tokenization Is The Endgame Scaramucci’s core argument was simple: tokenization is coming, and Solana is positioned to host a meaningful share of it. He said Paul Atkins, whom he described as a longtime personal friend, delivered what Scaramucci considers an underappreciated prediction: “In 5 years all of our assets are going to be tokenized.” Scaramucci then pushed his own conclusion: “What’s going to be the number one rail system to tokenize on? It’s going to be Solana.” He argued superior systems tend to win through adoption, not ideology. “If you have something that works better than something else, it gets adopted,” he said, comparing Solana’s trajectory to the internet’s jump from dial-up to today’s high-bandwidth reality. He also flagged operational progress on the network. “I don’t want to jinx us,” he said, but suggested Solana had gone “two years now without any” downtime. Related Reading: Solana Value Proposition Extends Beyond Tech Into Economic Infrastructure SolanaFloor challenged Scaramucci on why SkyBridge tokenized a $300 million fund on another chain. Scaramucci said it was “a very small fund,” and that a larger fund “will likely get tokenized on Solana.” He also rejected maximalism: “I don’t believe in chain monogamy,” he said. His view is that “three or four chains” will win, naming Solana and Avalanche. He argued Avalanche can be attractive for certain compliance-driven deployments, while Solana is where “stocks and bonds are going to be tokenized” and where “the larger funds are going to be tokenized.” Scaramucci also disclosed his personal positioning: “My largest personal position even greater than Bitcoin is my position in Solana and I have it all staked,” he said, adding he owns Avalanche and Bitcoin and holds a “very small position” in Ethereum. Scaramucci tied the next leg of the cycle to US policy and liquidity. If the US passes market-structure rules next year, he said, prices should respond. If inflation cools and the Fed can cut more aggressively under a new chair, he argued that would add liquidity and reinforce a “positive flywheel.” At press time, SOL traded at $125.

    "title": "Bitcoin Price Lags Network Utility: A Valuation Reset Is Underway",
    "body": "Bitcoin continues to struggle below the $90,000 level as volatility remains elevated and market conviction weakens. Short-term price swings have failed to establish a clear directional bias, reinforcing a broader sense of uncertainty among traders and investors. While price remains historically high, internal market conditions suggest that underlying stress is building beneath the surface, particularly within the mining sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Elevated Downside Risk: Loss Selling Takes Hold As STH SOPR Falls Below 1 A recent analysis by Axel Adler highlights growing pressure on Bitcoin miners using the Miner Financial Health Index, a composite metric that assesses mining profitability relative to price. Readings above 80% historically signal excessive profitability and late-cycle conditions, while levels below 20% indicate financial strain and elevated risk for miners. Currently, the index sits near 22%, once again approaching the Alert zone. This places miner profitability near one of its weakest levels since 2022, despite Bitcoin trading well above its summer 2022 price range. Similar conditions have typically appeared during post-correction phases or shortly after halving events, when revenue compression collides with high network difficulty. This divergence between elevated price levels and deteriorating miner fundamentals raises important questions about the sustainability of Bitcoin’s current structure as the market searches for its next equilibrium. Miner Economics Signal Growing Stress Beneath Bitcoin’s Price Adler’s analysis further examines the demand–supply balance within Bitcoin’s mining economics, offering deeper insight into why miner profitability continues to deteriorate. This index tracks the ratio of transaction fee revenue relative to new coin issuance, effectively measuring how much users are willing to pay for blockspace compared to the rate of supply expansion. Historically, readings above 70% indicate strong demand and a risk-on environment, while levels below 30% reflect structural weakness. Currently, the demand–supply balance sits near 38% on a 30-day average. While not yet in outright stress territory, the metric has declined steadily from local highs above 60%, placing it firmly in a neutral-weak zone. This trend suggests that organic demand for blockspace remains subdued, with users showing little urgency to outbid one another through higher fees. For a clear improvement in conditions, Adler notes that the index would need to reclaim levels above 50%, likely requiring a surge in transaction activity or a meaningful on-chain catalyst. This weakness is mirrored in absolute miner revenue. Bitcoin miner revenue, measured in US dollars and smoothed over seven days, has fallen to roughly $40 million after a recent peak. Although consistent with 2025 averages, this level remains well below revenue spikes seen during periods of heightened network activity. With difficulty remaining elevated, declining revenues amplify pressure on less efficient miners, reinforcing the stress signaled by both profitability and demand metrics. Related Reading: Legendary Bitcoin OG Deepens Ethereum Bet Despite Losses Exceeding $70 Million Bitcoin Price Struggles to Reclaim Key Trend Levels Bitcoin’s price action on the daily chart reflects a market struggling to regain structural strength after a sharp corrective phase. BTC is currently trading around the $88,000 area following a rebound from recent lows, but the broader trend remains fragile. The selloff from the $120,000–$125,000 region marked a clear break in momentum, with price slicing below the short-term moving averages and triggering accelerated downside pressure. Notably, Bitcoin lost the daily 50-day and 100-day moving averages during the decline, confirming a shift toward a bearish short-term structure. While the 200-day moving average continues to trend higher and remains intact, price is now consolidating just below it, turning this level into a critical zone of resistance. As long as BTC fails to reclaim and hold above this long-term trend line, upside attempts are likely to face selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Structure Turns Bearish As Structural Indicators Flip Negative The sharp increase in sell volume during the breakdown contrasts with relatively muted buying volume on the rebound, suggesting that recent upside moves are corrective rather than impulsive. Structurally, Bitcoin is forming a lower-high pattern, which keeps downside risk elevated if support near $85,000–$86,000 fails. For bulls to regain control, BTC must reclaim the 200-day moving average and establish higher highs. Until then, the chart favors consolidation or further volatility rather than a sustained recovery.

    "title": "Ethereum Exchange Supply Just Crashed To New Lows, Why This Is Bullish For Price",
    "body": "CryptoQuant has released a new report, highlighting a significant shift in Ethereum’s exchange supply dynamics and institutional behavior. According to the data, the amount of ETH held on crypto exchanges has crashed to unexpected lows. The decline coincides with growing institutional accumulation, a trend often viewed as an early signal of a bullish price outlook. Ethereum Exchange Balances Fall To 2016 Lows Arab Chain, a crypto analyst on CryptoQuant, revealed that Ethereum’s exchange supply ratio across all tracked platforms has declined to approximately 0.137. According to the data referenced in the report, this represents one of the lowest readings observed since 2016. Related Reading: Ethereum 2-Year Trend Maps Out This Unique Crash Path To Bottom At $2,187 The analyst emphasized that this metric reflects the proportion of total ETH supply currently held on exchanges relative to the overall circulating supply. Lower levels of this metric reflect a smaller fraction of ETH ready for liquidation on exchanges, which the analyst identifies as an important factor in understanding market liquidity conditions. Arab Chain also noted that the sustained decline in this ratio indicates a continued outflow of ETH from centralized exchanges to external wallets. This movement suggests that a smaller portion of Ethereum’s supply is readily available for trading. It also signals growing confidence among holders who prefer long-term positioning over short-term speculation. From a broader market perspective, a shrinking exchange supply is often seen as bullish for prices due to basic supply-and-demand dynamics. When fewer coins are available to sell, even a slight increase in demand can push prices up, as buyers compete for a smaller pool of liquid ETH. Reduced liquidity can also limit the intensity of declines, as large sell orders become harder to execute without moving the market. In his report, Arab Chain references historical behaviour, illustrated by a chart showing the Ethereum supply ratio for all exchanges. The analyst noted that similar declines in exchange supply have occurred during periods of reaccumulation or in the lead-up to stable price movements following significant market volatility. Ethereum Supply On Binance Crashes Arab Chain has also shared insights on Ethereum’s supply on Binance. The analyst disclosed that ETH balances on the exchange have been steadily declining over the past few months. As one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, Binance’s reserve changes often reflect broader market sentiment. Related Reading: Why Did The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP Prices Crash, And Will It Continue? The CryptoQuant report highlights that the Exchange Supply Ratio on Binance has crashed to 0.0325, a relatively low level compared to previous months. This indicates a steady withdrawal of ETH from the crypto exchange, reducing the amount of tokens available for immediate spot market selling. Arab Chain suggested that the drop in Ethereum supply on Binance shows that traders are becoming more cautious. Rather than engaging in short-term trades, many appear to be holding ETH off exchanges due to ongoing market volatility and uncertainty. The analyst added that the falling supply, combined with ETH’s price stability, indicates lower selling pressure. It also signals that the market may be entering a new phase of liquidity absorption and repositioning. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "The Bitcoin price has experienced a significant correction after reaching all-time highs above $126,000 in October, currently trading just above $87,900. This marks a notable 30% decline over the past few months. Despite this setback, analysts at Citi express optimism for the cryptocurrency’s future, forecasting that its value will continue to rise through 2026. Optimistic Bitcoin Price Predictions According to Citi’s analysts, the base case for the Bitcoin price is set at $143,000, reflecting a potential 62% increase from current levels. In a more bullish scenario, the cryptocurrency could surge to over $189,000, indicating a substantial 114% increase. Conversely, the analysts also present a bear case for the leading crypto, with an estimated price around $78,500, which would represent an additional 10.6% decline from current trading levels. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Support Shattered, Potential $100 Test Looms, Says Analyst The forecast from Citi relies on the assumption that investor adoption will persist, particularly with an influx of funds into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) projected to reach $15 billion. This influx is seen as a catalyst that could significantly boost the Bitcoin price. Furthermore, ongoing negotiations in the US Senate regarding their version of the crypto market structure bill, namely the CLARITY Act, which aims to regulate Bitcoin under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is anticipated to enhance market adoption. In contrast to Bitcoin, analysts express concerns regarding Ethereum’s (ETH) potential for growth. They argue that Ethereum, being viewed more as “programmable money,” has seen decreased activity, which has resulted in its current trading price of just below $3,000—40% below its all-time high of $4,964. Additional Catalyst For Price Growth Chris Neiger, an analyst at The Motley Fool, also attaches bullish predictions to the Bitcoin price future, highlighting that recent US job data reflects an unemployment rate increase to 4.6%, the highest since 2021. He asserted that if the Federal Reserve (Fed) chose to lower interest rates by 2026, the Bitcoin price could benefit since lower rates typically enhance the cryptocurrency’s value by making borrowing more affordable. In November, JPMorgan provided a more conservative estimate, suggesting that Bitcoin could reach $170,000 by 2026, with potential upside expected over the next six to twelve months. Related Reading: Crypto Payments Firm MoonPay Set For $5 Billion Valuation With NYSE Owner’s Backing Meanwhile, even more aggressive predictions from market researcher Fundstrat forecast the Bitcoin price could soar between $200,000 and $250,000 by the end of 2026, largely driven by the mainstream adoption of ETFs. Additionally, the establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the federal government has encouraged states to consider similar initiatives. Neiger concludes that just as ETFs have contributed to the credibility of cryptocurrencies and facilitated price increases, the formation of state-level Bitcoin reserves could serve as another critical driver propelling Bitcoin’s value higher in 2026.

    "title": "Peter Brandt Highlights Bearish XRP Price Chart, ‘You Need To Deal With It’",
    "body": "Veteran chartist Peter Brandt has once again turned his focus to the XRP community after sharing a technical breakdown that points to a bearish market structure on the weekly timeframe for the cryptocurrency. Brandt’s technical analysis focused squarely on chart behavior rather than sentiment, warning that the current setup carries downside implications that traders cannot ignore and must deal with. Peter Brandt Calls Out A Potential Double Top Taking to the social media platform X, Brandt highlighted what he described as a potential double top forming on XRP’s weekly chart. He acknowledged upfront that the pattern could still fail but stressed that, as things stand, the structure leans bearish. Related Reading: Analyst Says This XRP Level Is Keeping Downside Pressure In Check The analysis is based on XRP’s recent price action, which has lost the $2 price level after days of consistent bearish price action in December. Brandt framed the setup as a matter of accepting what the chart is showing rather than arguing against it, bluntly stating that market participants need to deal with the implications instead of dismissing them. His remarks were also directed at persistent XRP optimists, making it clear that his stance is not driven by bias against the asset but by adherence to classical chart principles. Until price action invalidates the pattern, the risk profile is tilted to the downside, and XRP might continue pushing downwards in the near term. “Love it or not — you need to deal with it,” Brandt said. The chart accompanying Brandt’s post shows XRP falling below the support of a flag pattern a few months ago. This breakdown has continued to the lower boundary around $1.80 to $2.00, which has acted as an important support pair against a resistance around $3.5. This support level has acted as a critical support region two times already this year. However, XRP looks like it might be losing this level now at the third time of asking. The weekly moving averages on the chart also appear to be flattening, a sign that upside strength has weakened compared to earlier phases of the cycle. What Would Change The Bearish Outlook A double top pattern is a bearish reversal signal, meaning an uptrend is likely ending and a downtrend is beginning. However, despite his firm tone, Brandt was careful to note that the pattern is conditional, not absolute. “This is a potential double top. Sure, it may fail, and I will deal with this if it does,” he said. Related Reading: XRP Price Falls To Critical Support Level, Is It Time To Panic? A sustained move back above the support at $2 would delay any breakdown into the $1 range. A further sustained reclaim of highs around $2.2, $2.5, $2.7, and $3 would invalidate the double top and force a reassessment of the broader trend. However, until such happens, Brandt’s technical structure continues to favor caution that many XRP proponents might not agree with. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Ethereum Exchange Outflows Soar To $978M: Sign Of Dip Buying?",
    "body": "On-chain data shows the Ethereum exchange netflow has witnessed a negative spike during the past week, a potential sign that investors have been accumulating. Ethereum Exchange Netflow Has Been Red For The Past Week As pointed out by institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora in a new post on X, Ethereum has seen net outflows from exchanges in the past week. The indicator of relevance here is the “Exchange Netflow,” which measures the net amount of ETH that’s moving into or out of wallets connected with centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the investors are depositing a net number of tokens to these platforms. As one of the main reasons why holders deposit their coins to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can be bearish for the asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge: Longs Dominate BTC, While ETH Shorts Rise On the other hand, the indicator being below zero suggests outflows are dominating the inflows on exchanges. Such a trend can be a sign that investors are in a phase of accumulation, which can naturally be bullish for the cryptocurrency. As the data shared by Sentora shows, Ethereum has seen a weekly Exchange Netflow value of -$978.45 million, indicating that traders have made a massive amount of net withdrawals. The significant outflows have come as Ethereum has witnessed a decline during the past week. As Sentora explains: This signals aggressive accumulation where investors are likely “buying the dip” and withdrawing assets to cold storage or on-chain environments, tightening the liquid supply despite the negative price momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Slide To $2,000 If December Closes Below This Level: Analyst The price drawdown in the past week has also accompanied a drop in the total transaction fees on the network, meaning that transfer activity has gone down. The blockchain saw about $2.64 million in fees over the last week, which is more than 15% down week-over-week. ETH Saw A Brief Visit Under $2,800 Before Rebounding Ethereum observed a decline to $2,780 on Thursday, but the asset was able to bounce back as it’s now floating just under $3,000. Interestingly, ETH’s bottom was around the same level as a major on-chain supply cluster, as a chart shared by analyst Ali Martinez in an X post shows. In the graph, Martinez has attached the data of the Ethereum UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode. This metric basically tells us how much ETH supply was last transacted at the various price levels that the coin has visited in its history. There is a huge supply zone located at $2,772 on the URPD, suggesting a large amount of investors have their cost basis at it. Generally, such levels act as a support boundary during downtrends, as traders who purchased there buy the dip to defend it. Featured image from Dall-E, Sentora.com, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Analysts Warn Strategy Could Be Dropped From Multiple Indexes, Potential $9 Billion Loss Predicted",
    "body": "Over the past few months, Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy), the largest publicly traded Bitcoin (BTC) treasury company, has found itself at the center of a pressing issue that could lead to its exclusion from the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) index. This potential move not only poses significant financial risks for the firm but could also have broader implications for the cryptocurrency sector, with analysts estimating that it could result in losses up to $9 billion in demand for its shares. Industry-Wide Consequences The MSCI proposed in October that companies holding digital assets comprising 50% or more of their total assets should be removed from its global benchmarks, arguing that such companies resemble investment funds, which are excluded from its indexes. However, many firms, including Strategy, assert that they are operational companies creating innovative products and argue that MSCI’s proposal is biased against the cryptocurrency industry. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Support Shattered, Potential $100 Test Looms, Says Analyst MSCI is currently conducting a public consultation, and analysts warn that if it decides to exclude Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies, it could prompt other index providers to follow suit. “The conversation already extends beyond just MSCI… to the eligibility of DATs in equity indexes in general,” said Kaasha Saini, head of index strategy at Jefferies, who anticipates that most equity indexes will align with MSCI’s decisions. Asset managers are believed to hold as much as 30% of a large-cap company’s free float, leading to potentially significant outflows if these companies are dropped from major indexes. This situation is particularly precarious for the DAT sector, which often finances its token purchases by selling stock. The company’s CEO, Phong Le, and co-founder Michael Saylor addressed the potential MSCI exclusion in a public letter. They estimated that such a move could lead to $2.8 billion worth of the company’s stock being liquidated and may “chill” the entire industry. In their letter, they explained that excluding DATs could shut them out from the roughly $15 trillion passive investment market, drastically undermining their competitive standing. Major Outflows Predicted For Strategy Analysts at TD Cowen estimated in November that around $2.5 billion of Strategy’s market value is linked to MSCI, with an additional $5.5 billion reliant on other indexes. JPMorgan’s analysis suggested that if MSCI were to exclude Strategy, the company could see $2.8 billion in outflows, a figure that could rise to $8.8 billion if it faced exclusion from other indexes, such as the Nasdaq 100, the CRSP US Total Market Index, and various Russell indexes owned by LSEG. In addition to Strategy, MSCI’s preliminary list identifies 38 companies at risk of exclusion, with a combined issuer market cap of $46.7 billion as of September 30, including French firm Capital B, which is also investing in Bitcoin. Related Reading: Crypto Payments Firm MoonPay Set For $5 Billion Valuation With NYSE Owner’s Backing Alexandre Laizet, Capital B’s director of Bitcoin strategy, remarked that while the current holdings of passive funds in their shares are limited, having access to passive flows is crucial for future adoption. Matt Cole, CEO of US-based Bitcoin buyer Strive—which is not at risk of exclusion—notes that the proposals have largely been factored into market valuations. He added, “On a longer-term basis, I think it raises the cost of capital for all Bitcoin treasury companies.” At the time of writing, the firm’s stock, which trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol MSTR, was trading at $165, marking gains of almost 4% ahead of the close of trading this week.

    "title": "Here’s Why The XRP Price Keeps Crashing",
    "body": "On-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant has revealed why the XRP price keeps crashing, recently dropping below the psychological $2 level. The platform noted that the XRP ETF approval has failed to stop the selling pressure but instead looks to have escalated it. Why The XRP Price Is Crashing Despite ETF Success In a CryptoQuant report, analyst PelinayPA revealed that the XRP price is facing significant selling pressure from whales holding between $100,000 and 1m XRP and those holding above 1m. These XRP whales are said to account for the majority of inflows into the crypto exchange Binance. Related Reading: Peter Brandt Highlights Bearish XRP Price Chart, ‘You Need To Deal With It’ These transfers indicate that these whales are typically looking to offload these coins, which is putting selling pressure on the XRP price. PelinayPA noted that after each major inflow spike on the chart, the XRP price forms a lower high and lower low structure, suggesting that supply is overwhelming demand at the moment. The CryptoQuant report noted that this happens because there is no strong new spot buyer in the market. The continuous increase in available supply is also said to keep pushing the XRP lower, even though the whales are not aggressively dumping. Meanwhile, PelinayPA highlighted key price levels to watch out for as the price continues to crash. The analyst stated that, based on the inflow intensity and price reactions, the first major support zone stands between $1.82 and $1.87. She noted that this range marked where the price briefly stabilized and where small buyers appeared. However, XRP still risks crashing to the $1.50 and $1.66 range if the large outflows continue. The chart does not indicate that the altcoin could rally anytime soon with this selling pressure. Whales Took Advantage Of The ETF Narrative The CryptoQuant report stated that, in theory, the XRP ETF process was expected to create institutional demand and push the price higher through spot buying. However, that hasn’t been the case, as there have instead been high-volume XRP inflows to Binance. PelinayPA explained that whales were the first to act as ETF approval expectations increased. Related Reading: XRP Hasn’t Entered A Bear Market Yet; Analyst Shares Why The analyst further revealed that XRP accumulated in advance for the ETF narrative was transferred to exchanges and used as sell-side liquidity. Basically, whales sold the ETF approval story to retail investors. As a result, the XRP price faces significant selling pressure every time it approaches the $1.95 level. PelinayPA reiterated that expecting a bullish move before exchange inflows decline would be an unrealistic assumption. However, it is worth noting that the XRP ETFs have been successful so far, accumulating over $1 billion in net assets in just over a month since their launch. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.90, up almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "Why XRP Price Is Playing Catch-Up Despite Successful ETF Launch: Analyst",
    "body": "After a strong start to the year, the XRP price has struggled to build a sustained bullish momentum throughout 2025. These struggles are highlighted in the altcoin’s downward spiral since hitting the all-time high of $3.65 in July 2025. The launch of the spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States was expected to offer some relief through increased demand for the underlying asset’s price. However, the latest on-chain analysis shows that the ETFs have failed to reduce the bearish pressure on the XRP price. XRP Price Could Fall To $1.5 If Exchange Inflows Persist In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, pseudonymous analyst PelinayPA revealed that the activity of a specific group of XRP whales has been the major driving force behind the steady price decline. The market pundit provided an ETF angle to this whale activity over the past few weeks. Related Reading: Peter Brandt Highlights Bearish XRP Price Chart, ‘You Need To Deal With It’ PelinayPA drew insights from the Exchange Inflow – Value Bands chart, which tracks and sorts the amount of a specific cryptocurrency flowing into centralized exchanges by different investor cohorts within a given period. Recent data shows that the majority of inflows are coming from the 100K-1M XRP and 1M+ XRP bands. PelinayPA wrote in the Quicktake post: After each major inflow spike on the chart, price forms a lower high and lower low structure, clearly showing that supply is overwhelming demand. This happens because there is no strong new spot buyer in the market. Even though whales are not aggressively dumping, the continuous increase in available supply keeps pushing the price lower. Using the inflow intensity and price reactions, the crypto analyst posited that the first major support zone stands at around $1.82 – $1.87. According to PelinayPA, this region represents an area with substantial historical buying activity that has offered stability in the past. However, the XRP price could fall to as low as the $1.50 – $1.60 range if the exchange inflows from whales continue to climb. As earlier inferred by the analyst, large transfers to centralized exchanges are often viewed as a signal of impending selling pressure. XRP Whales Offloaded Their Holdings When Spot ETFs Went Live As seen with its predecessors — Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the similar XRP exchange-traded products were expected to create institutional demand, leading to higher prices for the altcoin. However, the story has been the exact opposite for the XRP price, which is nearly 50% down from its all-time high. Market data shows that the US-based spot XRP ETFs have not registered a negative outflow day since their trading debut in mid-November. According to SoSoValue, the exchange-traded funds have a total net asset of over $1.14 billion. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Supply Just Crashed To New Lows, Why This Is Bullish For Price Interestingly, PelinayPA hypothesized that the reason behind XRP’s steady decline is that whales started offloading their holdings on exchanges as the ETF expectations heightened. This provided the sell-side liquidity for the retail investors who were looking to buy the ETF launch news. PelinayPA said that this occurrence explains why the XRP price faces selling pressure each time it approaches the $1.95 level. The market analyst noted that the exchange inflows would first need to dry up if the altcoin is to see a bullish run anytime soon. As of this writing, the price of XRP stands at around $1.90, reflecting an over 3% jump in the past 24 hours. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin’s Cost Base Resets As New Whales Take The Lead",
    "body": "According to onchain data, Bitcoin may be moving into a different phase of market participation rather than simply hitting a classic cycle top or bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin Feels The Weight Of Quantum Risk Concerns, Industry Leaders Warn New, large entrants are paying higher prices and holding on, and that change is reshaping where the network’s cost base sits. This is not just a short blip; the pattern has several clear data points behind it. New Whales Rewrite The Network Cost Base According to CryptoQuant figures, addresses classified as new whales now account for almost 50% of Bitcoin’s realized cap. Before 2025, that share rarely rose above 22%. Realized cap tracks the value of BTC at the price each coin last moved, so this shift shows where capital entered the system, not just who currently holds the most coins. Reports say the realized cap share from new whales continued to climb even during pullbacks, which suggests the network’s aggregate cost basis is being re-anchored at higher levels. Short-Term Demand Surges As Larger Players Buy Dips Short-term holder supply expanded by roughly 100,000 BTC over a 30-day span, reaching an all-time high, according to analysts. That jump in STH supply points to intense demand at the near-term level. Based on exchange flows, about 37% of BTC sent to Binance came from whale-size wallets, defined in the data set as holdings between 1,000–10,000 BTC. Reports from Hyblock show the cumulative volume delta for whale wallets — those in the $100,000–$10 million range — posted a positive $135 million delta this week. In contrast, retail wallets ($0–$10,000) and mid-size traders ($10,000–$100,000) logged negative deltas of $84 million and $172 million, respectively. In short: larger players absorbed selling pressure while smaller holders reduced their exposure.

Bitcoin rose to $88,000 from $85,100 in about five hours after the Bank of Japan raised rates, a move that many investors had tracked as a potential macro trigger. Open interest climbed faster than the price, and funding rates turned positive, which indicates fresh margin-driven long positions were being added rather than a simple cover of shorts. That kind of flows pattern raises the chance of volatile reversals if sentiment shifts, even when spot demand looks healthy. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",
