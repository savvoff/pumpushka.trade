    "body": "XRP price failed to gain pace above $2.320 and trimmed gains. The price is now struggling and faces resistance near the $2.20 level. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.250 zone. The price is now trading below $2.250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2.245 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below $2.150. XRP Price Trims Gains XRP price failed to continue higher above $2.35 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below $2.320 and $2.250 to enter a short-term bearish zone. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2.245 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair even spiked below $2.150. A low was formed at $2.141, and the price is now showing bearish signs below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.416 swing high to the $2.141 low. The price is now trading below $2.250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.20 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.250 level. A close above $2.250 could send the price to $2.30. The next hurdle sits at $2.320 and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.416 swing high to the $2.141 low. A clear move above the $2.320 resistance might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.40 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.450. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.250 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.150 level. The next major support is near the $2.120 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.120 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.050. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.880.

    "title": "Did Morgan Stanley Orchestrate Bitcoin October Crash? Analysts Draw Correlations",
    "body": "Morgan Stanley’s filing for a Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF), coupled with MSCI’s decision to retain digital asset companies in its index, has ignited a wave of speculation among analysts. Notably, analysts from Bull Theory have alleged that these events could be indicative of a larger-scale market manipulation. Bitcoin Market Manipulation? In a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the Bull Theory analysts drew attention to the timeline of events involving Bitcoin, arguing that the trajectory from its October crash to its subsequent recovery in January resembles an orchestrated setup supported by data. The first significant trigger occurred on 10 October, when MSCI — previously a division of Morgan Stanley — proposed removing Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs) from its global indexes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Accumulation Continues: Strategy Purchases 1,287 BTC Amid Rising Prices This decision would affect firms like Strategy and Metaplanet, which hold substantial Bitcoin assets on their balance sheets. The implications were profound, given that MSCI’s indexes guide trillions of dollars in passive investments. If these companies were removed, institutional investors, including pension funds and ETFs, would be compelled to divest, leading to a substantial contraction in institutional exposure to Bitcoin and an immediate tightening of liquidity. Following that announcement, Bitcoin’s price plummeted by nearly $18,000, wiping out over $900 billion from the total crypto market cap. Morgan Stanley And The MSCI Shift The uncertainty continued with a consultation period that remained open until December 31. This three-month window of prolonged anxiety effectively froze investor demand for Bitcoin. Passive investors became wary, index-linked funds faced potential forced selling, and as a result, prices saw a stark decline—with Bitcoin dropping about 31% and altcoins suffering even more, marking the worst quarter for crypto markets since 2018. However, the tide began to shift on January 1, 2026, as Bitcoin experienced an unexpected surge, rising 8% in just five days. This $7,300 increase, from $87,500 to $94,800, left many analysts puzzled, especially since the relentless selling had seemingly halted abruptly. The analysts noted that this sudden upturn could imply that insiders might have had prior knowledge of forthcoming developments. Then, the narrative shifted dramatically on January 5 and 6. In a matter of 24 hours, Morgan Stanley unveiled its plans for spot Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and Solana ETFs. This was followed by MSCI announcing its decision not to proceed with the previously proposed exclusion of crypto-heavy companies from its indexes. A Calculated Move? The sequence of these events has led the analysts to present a narrative: MSCI initiated pressure by threatening index removals in October, leading to an extended period of uncertainty and suppressed prices. Related Reading: Solana Shatters Records: 2025 Annual Review Reveals New All-Time Highs In Key Metrics Once institutions had accumulated at lower prices, Morgan Stanley introduced its ETF, and MSCI subsequently removed the threat of exclusion, raising serious concerns about the possibility of coordinated efforts to manipulate market conditions. Bull Theory analysts assert that as the market now transitions back towards liquidity, the same entities that potentially orchestrated the prior downturn may be strategically positioned to profit from the rebound. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $91,550, having retraced 2% from the $95,000 2-month high reached at the beginning of the week. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Why Morgan Stanley’s Bitcoin ETF Is The ‘Most Bullish Thing Ever’: Jeff Park",
    "body": "Morgan Stanley’s decision to file for spot Bitcoin and Solana ETFs caught even seasoned ETF watchers off guard and in Jeff Park’s telling, it’s a stronger signal about crypto’s next leg of adoption than another round of flows into the existing market leaders. The surprise wasn’t merely that a major wirehouse wants in. It was the branding and the timing. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said he “didn’t see this coming,” amplifying Eric Balchunas’ “SHOCKER” reaction to the filings. Seyffart then pointed to Matt Hougan’s framing of what made it unusual: “Morgan Stanley manages 20 ETFs, but mostly under the Calvert/Parametric/Eaton Vance brands. These will be the 3rd and 4th ETFs to bear the ‘Morgan Stanley’ brand. Pretty remarkable.” Park, the head of alpha strategies at Bitwise and ProCap CIO, argues the late-cycle entry is precisely why the filing matters. “It is unheard of for a vanilla ETF product to launch two years after the first to market has already secured the liquidity throne,” he wrote. “IAU famously tried a year later, and never caught up.” Park’s point was that Morgan Stanley wouldn’t make that bet unless internal channels were flashing something the broader market still underestimates. Why This Is ‘The Most Bullish Thing’ For Bitcoin Park framed the filing as a total addressable market story, not a product story. “It means the market is MUCH bigger than even crypto professionals anticipated, especially to reach NEW customers,” he said. “This signals that despite IBIT being the fastest ETF in history to reach $80Bn in AUM (roughly 1/5th the time it took for second place VOO), there is enough untapped interest as viably researched and ascertained through MS’ proprietary wealth channels that they are willing to bet that a branded product has commercial viability.” He finished that thought with the kind of line that reads like a thesis statement for 2026: “It means we are still so early.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Wins As Trump Pumps GDP, Suppresses Oil: Arthur Hayes The “why now” also fits with Seyffart’s longer-running view that institutional platforms would eventually shift. “I’ve been saying for literal years that most of these firms will change their tune on crypto,” he wrote. “But it really was just a couple months ago that Morgan Stanley advisors were barred from buying crypto ETFs for their clients.” In other words: the timeline is compressing, and the posture is moving from cautious access to product ownership. Park’s second argument is that Morgan Stanley is treating Bitcoin as an identity product as much as an allocation sleeve. “It means that Bitcoin is ‘socially’ important just as much as it is ‘financially’ important as a product to offer to customers,” he wrote. “Consider the fact that for being ‘digital gold’ there are virtually no branded gold ETFs in existence, yet for Bitcoin there is.” In his view, that difference is the tell: a house-branded Bitcoin ETF isn’t only about exposure, it’s about what the firm signals to clients and recruits by having it at all. Park argued the branding functions as a credibility marker with a specific audience in mind. “This is because every asset manager knows that having a Bitcoin ETF communicates that they are forward thinking, young, and a little edgy that allows targeting the most challenging investor cohort that everyone wants to reach: UHNW Independent Investors,” he said.“ Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates Improve, But Signal Still Not Decisive: Glassnode Morgan Stanley is making the bet that even if their ETF doesn’t scale to blockbuster success, there’s an intangible benefit that will help build their clout.” The third pillar is defensive: platform economics. “It is at the core a defensive move against platform disintermediation and fee leakage,” Park wrote. “By launching their own BTC ETF after IBIT already consolidated liquidity, Morgan Stanley is implicitly acknowledging a hard truth: DISTRIBUTION owns the customer, not product superiority.” He added why that matters strategically: “They are not going to let advisors default to third parties by outsourcing the economic rent. That’s why at first glance while this launch looks irrational through a pure AUM lens, also totally inevitable through a PLATFORM ECONOMICS lens.” That logic also surfaced in Seyffart’s exchange with James Van Straten, who asked why anyone would be surprised if a firm has “own distribution” and “huge demand from clients.” Seyffart’s answer didn’t dispute demand; it underscored that Morgan Stanley historically “doesn’t do a ton of ETF launches,” and that the decision to do so here is itself informative, even if, as he put it, “there’s plenty of demand” for many products that platforms never bother to manufacture. On timing, Seyffart said approval is “at least 75 days from now,” emphasizing that 75 days can be the fastest possible path under current processes, but also that “there’s plenty of products that don’t launch right at 75 days.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,256.

    "title": "XRP Named The ‘New Cryptocurrency Darling’ After Strong Start Of The Year",
    "body": "Following a remarkable performance in the first trading days of the year, CNBC anchors have named XRP the breakout trade of 2026, arguing that it has been the silent outperformer during the recent crypto market volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin At A Crossroads: $93,500 Reclaim Holds The Key For Next Move XRP Becomes The Hottest Trade Of The Year CNBC’s Brian Sullivan highlighted XRP’s strong start to the year, calling the cryptocurrency the “new cryptocurrency darling” of 2026 and placing it ahead of the market’s leading assets. During the Power Lunch segment, the network’s anchor affirmed that “the hottest crypto trade of the year is not Bitcoin, it is not Ether, it is XRP,” arguing that there’s “big money behind this trade.” In his initial remarks, he pointed out the altcoin’s remarkable seven-day rally toward the recent highs. XRP has seen a notable performance since the start of the year, climbing over 30% from its yearly opening to its two-month high of $2.41 on Tuesday morning. Amid this recent performance, the altcoin recently flipped BNB again to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a place it had lost during the December market volatility. Moreover, it has outperformed most of the largest cryptocurrencies in the weekly timeframe, including BTC’s and ETH’s 4.3% and 6.2% respective rallies. CNBC’s MacKenzie Sigalos weighed in on XRP’s performance on various segments, affirming that “XRP has been the quiet outperformer for months now.” She addressed whether XRP is taking its place as “the next cool thing to know about” or whether it has a different and more relevant use case that sets it apart from the leading cryptocurrencies, emphasizing its role in cross-border payments as one of its key appeals. What’s Driving The Rally? Sigalos cited three main reasons for the strong star-of-the-year performance. First, she stated that “the regulatory overhang has finally cleared as Ripple has fully wrapped up its SEC fight as of August 2nd.” Second, she asserted that people consider the cryptocurrency “a less crowded trade than Bitcoin or Ether,” which “proved out to be true” just in the first trading days of January. For the third reason, she pointed out that “the flows have held up even during the Q4 dip,” arguing that investors continued to add to XRP-based funds, while the largest crypto ETFs’ flows fell with the price. Well, it’s actually been interesting is that during the doldrums of Q4, you actually saw a lot of people piling into those XRP ETFs, which is the exact opposite of what happens with the spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, where people really move in tandem with the price of the coin. But it was the fact that it is a way to have a higher percentage jump. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Q1 Outlook: Analyst Shares Historical Setup As Price Nears Key Resistance Notably, XRP funds had a remarkable performance since their launch in Q4 2025. The investment products, which first debuted in November, have recorded cumulative net inflows of $1.25 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. The ETF category has not recorded a single day of negative net flows in nearly two months, with consistent inflows since going live. During the first three trading days of the year, XRP funds have seen a total inflow of $78.81 million. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $2.19, a 20% increase in the weekly timeframe.

    "title": "GENIUS Act Key Provisions In Spotlight: XRP Attorney Deaton Alerts To Bankers’ Role",
    "body": "In the lead-up to the potential passage of the crypto market structure bill, known as the CLARITY Act, Faryar Shirzad, Chief Policy Officer at Coinbase, shed light on the ongoing discussions surrounding key provisions of the already enacted GENIUS Act. GENIUS Act Under Fire Shirzad noted that the stablecoin rewards provisions of the GENIUS Act are currently a central topic of debate among lawmakers. Shiraz remarked, “reopening it now only creates uncertainty and risks the future of the US Dollar as commerce moves onchain.” Shirzad emphasized the importance of protecting the GENIUS Act, arguing that rewards benefit consumers without adversely affecting community banks. Related Reading: Solana Shatters Records: 2025 Annual Review Reveals New All-Time Highs In Key Metrics He alleged that the motivation behind banks’ opposition to stablecoin rewards is evident. He claimed that US banks currently generate approximately $176 billion annually from the $3 trillion they hold at the Federal Reserve (Fed) and another $187 billion from card swipe fees, which averages to nearly $1,440 for each household. This results in over $360 billion yearly from payments and deposits, in addition to substantial unused lending capacity, as the Federal Reserve incentivizes banks to maintain reserves rather than deploy them. According to Shirzad, stablecoin rewards pose a challenge to these financial margins—not by impeding banks’ ability to lend, but by introducing real competition in payment systems. Shirzad further expressed alarm at how, during these Senate discussions, China has recognized the opportunity presented by the bank lobby. The country has recently announced interest payments to users of its Digital Yuan, aiming to undermine the supremacy of the US dollar. He warned that banning rewards in the Senate would inadvertently aid China’s efforts to challenge the dollar’s dominance. Concluding his remarks, Shirzad asserted that the opposition from banks toward stablecoin rewards is not based on prudential concerns but stems from a desire to protect lucrative revenue streams threatened by competition. Deaton Critiques ABA’s Threat To Stablecoin Rewards John E. Deaton — attorney for XRP holders in the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple Labs and a former Senate candidate — also reacted to these developments. He emphasized the importance of the situation as China officially began offering interest on the digital yuan. He highlighted that the American Bankers Association (ABA) is exerting pressure on the Senate to close a “third-party loophole” in the GENIUS Act, which would restrict companies like Coinbase (COIN) and Kraken from offering rewards to consumers. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Queue Grows: What Does This Mean For ETH Prices Moving Forward? Deaton argued that banning American firms from providing yield to everyday citizens does not protect banks, as claimed by the ABA; rather, it risks forcing global reliance on China’s currency over the US dollar. He emphasized that major banks are threatened by the concept of digital dollars because they are unable to “rent” that money back to consumers if individuals are earning yield themselves. The criticism also extended to banking officials, with Deaton asserting that the Banking Policy Institute, led by figures like Jamie Dimon, has crafted an anti-crypto bill last year that undermines the interests of average Americans. He contended that if the Senate capitulates to the bank lobby, it effectively imposes a hidden tax on retail investors and customers nationwide to safeguard Wall Street’s profits.

    "title": "Bitcoin Bounce A Bull Trap? Analyst Sees 2022-Style Bear Flag",
    "body": "A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how the recent Bitcoin price action could echo the bear flag formation from the 2021-22 period. Bitcoin May Be Inside A Bear Flag Right Now In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a similarity that has been emerging between the Bitcoin price trend from 2021-22 and that from 2025-26. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Nears Neutral As Price Recovers Below is the chart shared by Martinez that puts the two periods side-by-side. As is visible in the graph, Bitcoin saw a 54% drawdown during the first half of 2021, before witnessing another leg of the bull run to a new all-time high (ATH) above $69,000 later in the year. This high was followed by a bearish shift, with the price quickly sliding off as 2022 arrived. In 2022, the cryptocurrency observed consolidation inside a technical analysis (TA) pattern known as a Bear Flag. As the name suggests, Flag patterns look like a flag on a pole. In the case of a Bear Flag, the setup is oriented in the reverse direction; an initial sharp downward move represents the “pole,” while a parallel consolidation channel makes up for the “flag.” When the asset is trading inside the flag, it finds support at the lower level of the channel and resistance at the upper one. A break out of either of these bounds can signal a sustained move in that direction. Flags are considered to be continuation patterns, meaning that breakouts from them are likely to lead into the same direction as the preceding price trend. That is, a breakout could occur in the same direction as the pole. From the chart, it’s apparent that this appears to be what happened with Bitcoin back in 2022, with the price escaping downward from the Bear Flag with a sharp crash. Jumping to the recent Bitcoin price action, the cryptocurrency saw a similar trajectory in 2025 as in 2021, with an initial leg of the bull run leading to a second one that resulted in a new ATH (this time above $126,000). One difference, however, was that the legs of this bull market were separated by a price decline of just 30%. Since the latest record, BTC has once again faced a bearish transition, with its price plummeting to a low in November and beginning a period of consolidation. The analyst thinks that the latest phase of sideways movement could be occurring inside a Bear Flag, similar to the one from 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates Improve, But Signal Still Not Decisive: Glassnode It now remains to be seen whether the cryptocurrency’s trajectory is indeed similar this time around as well or if the two cycles will diverge.

    "title": "XRP Whales Wake Up: $100,000+ Transfers Hit 3-Month High",
    "body": "XRP Ledger whale activity spiked sharply at the start of the week, with on-chain data provider Santiment flagging a surge in large-value transfers that pushed the network to its highest $100,000+ transaction count in roughly three months, a setup the firm says typically coincides with elevated volatility. XRP Whales Are Waking Up Again “XRP Ledger has seen a major increase in whale transactions (moved valued at $100K or more on the network),” Santiment wrote in a post on Wednesday via X alongside a Sanbase chart. “Monday saw 2,170 of them, and yesterday shot all the way up to 2,802 (a 3-month high). Volatility should be higher than usual.” The chart, labeled “XRP $1M+ & $100K+ Whale Transactions Per Day,” highlights two specific data points for the $100K+ threshold: 2,170 transactions on Jan. 5, 2026 and 2,802 transactions on Jan. 6, 2026. The Jan. 6 print is marked as the local peak and, per Santiment’s commentary, the strongest reading in approximately three months, the highest shown since the infamous October 10 liquidation event. Related Reading: XRP Rally Reopens The $8–$12 Zone Debate, Says Will Taylor While Santiment’s post spotlights $100K+ transfers, the chart also tracks $1 million-plus whale transactions. That series suggests large-holder activity picked up across multiple size bands into the early-January move, with $1 million transactions pushing to a one-month high, the strongest reading since early December. The jump stands out because $1 million-plus activity appears to have been comparatively muted through most of December, especially when set against the mid-October to November stretch, when the chart shows more frequent days with higher counts. Related Reading: XRP Sees Back-to-Back Liquidation Waves: Binance Absorbs Majority Of Liquidations In practical market terms, traders tend to watch bursts in large on-chain transfers for what they might represent rather than treating the raw counts as a directional signal. Spikes can reflect accumulation or distribution, internal treasury movements by large entities, exchange-related transfers, or positioning around liquidity events. What they often share is mechanical impact: when large holders move size, the probability of sharper intraday swings tends to increase, particularly if that activity persists over multiple sessions. XRP Also Re-Enters The Social ‘Trending’ Set The whale-transaction alert landed alongside a separate Santiment update that placed XRP among the assets seeing the biggest jumps in discussion across social channels. In that post, Santiment grouped XRP with Solana, Ethereum, Bitcoin, MicroStrategy, and Litecoin as the day’s top “trending” tickers by changes in conversation volume for Wednesday. For XRP specifically, Santiment said the discussion mix leaned heavily institutional in tone: ETF flows, “record-breaking net assets,” and the idea of XRP as a high-beta trade into 2025–2026 narratives while also referencing perceived regulatory clarity after the SEC case resolution and use cases such as bridge activity for stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets. Those claims were presented as themes circulating in social chatter rather than as independently verified developments in the post itself. At press time, XRP traded at $2.127.

    "title": "Bitcoin Absorbs The Flush: Quantum Structure Signals Wave (3) Toward $104,000",
    "body": "Bitcoin has absorbed a sharp sell-off and stabilized at key support, signaling that buyers are firmly in control. With the market holding its structure, insights from Quantum Models suggest that Wave (3) is underway, pointing toward a near-term target around $104,000. Q-Structure Confluence Holds Firm, Keeping The Bullish Bias Alive Elliott Chart, in a recent update, highlighted that Bitcoin remains firmly supported around the Q-Structure λ₅ confluence zone, a level that continues to underpin the broader bullish outlook. This support area has absorbed selling pressure, suggesting that larger participants are still defending key levels despite recent volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dips Further, Setting Up a High-Stakes Support Moment Upon closer examination of market structure, the recent pullback is now being classified as a complex corrective phase rather than the beginning of a larger downtrend. Specifically, the correction is interpreted as Intermediate Wave (2), unfolding through a Zigzag W | Zigzag X | Triangle Y setup. With this corrective pattern largely resolved, Elliott Chart highlights that Intermediate Wave (3) is now in progress, with Minor Waves 1 and 2 already taking shape. This suggests the market is building the foundation for a more decisive move higher. The critical piece still developing is an impulsive Minor Wave 3. Historically, this wave tends to be the strongest and most aggressive part of an advance. If it unfolds as expected, the model points to a near-term Q-Target around $104,444, generated using the Q-Structure λᵣ projection. This bullish scenario is derived from insights within the Quantum Models framework and is not based on short-term noise. Notably, this potential trend reversal was first projected back on November 15, during Bitcoin’s decline. Sharp Flush Finds Strong Demand At Key Levels Delving into current price actions, CyrilXBT disclosed that Bitcoin experienced a sharp flush but found buyers precisely at a critical support level, allowing the price to stabilize and gradually grind higher. This reaction indicates that the recent sell-off was absorbed by strong demand rather than driven by panic selling, reflecting healthy market participation from buyers at key zones.

What stands out most is the higher-low structure that has emerged following the drop. This formation is important because it signals that downside pressure is weakening. As long as Bitcoin continues to hold within this reclaimed range, the risk of a deeper sell-off diminishes, and the market maintains the potential for further upward moves. Sideways or consolidating price action at these levels is constructive for the overall crypto market. Maintaining this structure sets the stage for a healthier, more sustainable advance for Bitcoin rather than a rushed or volatile rebound. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Ethereum Validators Face Multi-Week Wait As Staking Participation Rises",
    "body": "The Ethereum staking ecosystem is showing clear signs of tightening as demand for validators continues to rise. Participants now face a multi-week wait to enter the network. This growing staking queue reflects a structural shift in how ETH is being held and deployed less as a liquid supply and more as long-term productive capital. As more ETH becomes locked in validation, the dynamics of supply, yield, and network security are quietly being reshaped. Why Validator Delays Add Friction To Supply Re-Entry The current state of Ethereum staking highlights a growing problem with predictability. Crypto expert Dave has pointed out on X that the ETH staking entry queue is now showing an estimated wait of 25 days and 4 hours to enter. Previously, the wait time was around 7.55 days, which is a more than threefold increase in wait time over a relatively short period. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Deposits Just Surpassed Withdrawals, Why This Could Send ETH Price Above $4,000 At the same time, the exit queue is reporting a wait time of 14 minutes, which previously sat for 44.25 days, representing a reduction of well over 4,000 times, from weeks to minutes. According to Dave, staking on a blockchain with this level of variance between entry and exit requirements is uncertain. Waiting weeks to enter while exit clears almost instantly makes staking behavior highly state-dependent and unpredictable. This contract is exactly why the expert prefers staking on Cardano, because there is no entry queue. Also, delegation is reflected on-chain immediately, and stake changes are transparent and deterministic. The only delay is a fixed active stake period of two epochs, which is 10 days before delegation changes take effect. This consistency is the difference because there are no dynamic queues, no sudden shifts, and no surprises driven by changing network states. If demand to stake on Cardano increases rapidly, it will make absolutely no difference, because predictability matters especially with monetary investments. Why Throughput Without Context Is Meaningless The headline claim of $8 trillion in stablecoin transfers on Ethereum sounds impressive, but it’s a completely meaningless metric. Crypto analyst DBCrypto noted that a single entity can move $1 billion back and forth between two wallets ten times, creating a sudden $10 billion in volume, but generating zero economic activity. Related Reading: Big Bet On Ethereum: CEO Sees 10X TVL Growth In 2026 This is why banks don’t advertise transfer volume as a growth metric, as volume without context tells nothing about utility or growth. However, crypto continues to elevate these numbers as milestones because big figures pump bags. What’s being measured here is motion and activity, not progress or value. DBCrypto concluded that until the industry stops celebrating vanity metrics, it will continue to confuse noise for signal. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin Rapid Accumulation Suggests Sharp Upward Sweep Is Coming",
    "body": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is rebounding strongly alongside the broader meme coin market, which has experienced a notable uptick in Q1 2026. As sentiment surrounding meme coins continues to improve, a crypto analyst suggests that Dogecoin could be positioning for more gains. The analyst notes that Dogecoin’s rapid accumulation signals the potential for a sharp upward sweep in the near term. Dogecoin Accumulation Signals Upward Sweep Crypto market expert Bitguru recently shared a fresh technical outlook on Dogecoin, highlighting how its price structure has consistently changed after months of corrective movement. According to him, a completed liquidity sweep followed by an extended consolidation phase suggests that the market has reset and may be setting up for a bullish continuation. Related Reading: Catalysts That Suggests The Dogecoin Price Rally Could Continue Bitguru explained that Dogecoin’s chart shows price stability after clearing sell-side liquidity between November and December 2025, which pushed out weak holders and created a base for accumulation. The consolidation that continued into 2026 shows lower volatility and steady base building, two conditions the analyst believes are needed before Dogecoin’s next major price move. The chart also illustrates bullish patterns, such as a rounded H cup formation and a continuation phase in the middle of 2025, which helped establish higher price levels before the broader market pullback. Bitguru added that Dogecoin’s recent move back above the key support near $0.14 suggests accumulation is likely completed, as price now starts to tighten and move upward from its base level. He noted that as long as Dogecoin stays above this reclaimed support, the chances of an upward sweep toward higher supply zones increase. The chart also points to potential gains reaching the highlighted green target area between $0.188 and $0.194, which lines up with past resistance levels that have previously limited price movement during the decline. Area That Could Invalidate Upward Sweep Bitguru’s chart also shows the possibility of a price decline despite the rapid increase in accumulation. The red zone on the chart represents a stop-loss or risk area. If Dogecoin falls below the support area around $0.148, it could initiate a drop toward new lows within this risk zone. Related Reading: The Dogecoin Cycle Fractal That Shows Where The Price Is Headed Next If the meme coin’s price dips below the consolidation zone between $0.146 and $0.148, then the analyst’s bullish setup and potential upward sweep could be invalidated. The chart projects a potential decline to the $0.13-$0.11 range, reflecting a decrease of more than 9% from current levels. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at $0.143, up more than 18% this week, according to CoinMarketCap data. Although the meme coin is showing clear signs of a recovery from former downtrends, its trading volume is still down by more than 30%. Moreover, DOGE’s price has been unexpectedly volatile recently, dropping by 5% over the past 24 hours. Featured image from Pngtree, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "According to an ambitious research study published by asset manager and cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer VanEck, Bitcoin (BTC) could potentially reach a staggering price of $2.9 million per coin by 2050. The insights come from Matthew Sigel, the firm’s Head of Digital Assets Research, and Senior Investment Analyst Patrick Bush, who have employed a valuation framework based on Bitcoin’s role in two primary total addressable markets: as a medium of exchange (MoE) and as a reserve asset for central banks. VanEck Projects 15% CAGR For Bitcoin In their analysis, Sigel and Bush project a 15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from Bitcoin’s current levels, which would position the cryptocurrency as a significant player in the global economy. Related Reading: Did Morgan Stanley Orchestrate Bitcoin October Crash? Analysts Draw Correlations The report outlines two structural shifts that they believe will be pivotal for Bitcoin’s appreciation. The first, dubbed the Settlement Pivot, predicts that by 2050, Bitcoin will be responsible for settling between 5% and 10% of global international trade, as well as 5% of domestic trade transactions. The second crucial aspect, referred to as the Reserve Pivot, connects Bitcoin’s potential growth to waning trust in G7 sovereign debt. As confidence in these currencies diminishes, the authors anticipate that central banks might allocate resources toward Bitcoin as a hedge against fiscal instability. Yet, the VanEck report does not stop at a mere base case; it also explores a more optimistic scenario termed the Bull Case. ‘Hyper-Bitcoinization’ In this scenario, known as “hyper-bitcoinization,” if Bitcoin captures 20% of international trade and 10% of domestic GDP, its value could skyrocket to $53.4 million per coin, representing a major 29% CAGR. Achieving this would require Bitcoin to either equal or surpass gold’s status as a primary global reserve asset, making up nearly 30% of financial assets worldwide. Related Reading: GENIUS Act Key Provisions In Spotlight: XRP Attorney Deaton Alerts To Bankers’ Role For context, the report uses a baseline current price of approximately $88,000 when projecting these values. Interestingly, it incorporates a Bear Case target of $130,000, reflecting a modest 2% CAGR. In terms of correlation, VanEck anticipates that Bitcoin will exhibit low to moderate correlation with global equities, bonds, and gold over various market cycles. Notably, they emphasize a persistent negative correlation with the US Dollar (DXY), reinforcing Bitcoin’s potential role as a hedge against monetary debasement.

    "title": "Bearish Signal Emerges For Ethereum As US Spot Demand Fades",
    "body": "Ethereum has once again failed to hold above a critical resistance zone, retracing from the $3,300 level back toward the $3,100 area. The pullback highlights the market’s ongoing struggle to establish a sustainable recovery, as bullish momentum continues to fade near key technical thresholds. While buyers have managed to prevent a deeper correction for now, the inability to reclaim higher levels has reinforced a cautious tone across the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tests Key Resistance While $4.7B In Sell-Side Liquidity Builds Beyond price action, on-chain data adds an important layer to this weakness. According to data from CryptoQuant, Ethereum’s Coinbase Premium Gap has dropped sharply into negative territory. This metric, often used as a proxy for US institutional demand, reflects the price difference between Coinbase and offshore exchanges. A negative reading suggests that buying interest from US-based investors is lagging behind global activity, reducing the probability of a strong upside continuation. Historically, sustained Ethereum rallies have coincided with a positive Coinbase Premium, signaling consistent institutional accumulation. The current divergence between price attempts to stabilize and weakening US demand creates a structural headwind for bulls. As long as this premium remains negative, reclaiming the $3,300 level becomes increasingly difficult. For now, Ethereum appears trapped in a fragile range, where price stability depends less on aggressive buying and more on the absence of renewed selling pressure. The coming sessions will be decisive in determining whether this consolidation evolves into a recovery or resolves to the downside. Coinbase Premium Weakness Undermines Recovery Attempt A new on-chain signal is reinforcing the cautious outlook for Ethereum as it trades below key resistance. Analysis shared by CryptoQuant and highlighted by CryptoOnchain shows that the Coinbase Premium Gap has deteriorated sharply, reaching its most negative level in nearly a year. The 14-day moving average of the metric has fallen to around -2.3, indicating that ETH prices on Coinbase are trading at a notable discount compared to Binance. This divergence matters because Coinbase activity is often used as a proxy for US institutional demand. When the premium turns deeply negative, it typically signals that buyers in the US spot market are either stepping aside or actively distributing rather than accumulating. That dynamic is unfolding as Ethereum remains capped below the $3,300 resistance zone, following its sharp correction from the October peak near $4,700. The combination of weak price follow-through and declining Coinbase demand creates a bearish divergence. While ETH attempts to stabilize, the lack of institutional participation reduces the probability of a sustained breakout. Historically, strong Ethereum rallies have required a positive Coinbase Premium, reflecting consistent inflows from US-based investors. Until this gap narrows and flips back into positive territory, Ethereum’s upside appears constrained. For now, the data suggests caution is warranted, as the persistence of weak US demand increases the risk that recent consolidation resolves into another leg lower rather than a confirmed recovery. Related Reading: XRP Sees Back-to-Back Liquidation Waves: Binance Absorbs Majority Of Liquidations Ethereum Struggles As Recovery Lacks Confirmation Ethereum’s price action remains fragile after failing to reclaim the $3,300 resistance zone. On the daily chart, ETH is trading near the $3,100–$3,150 area, a level that has acted as a short-term pivot but has not yet attracted strong follow-through from buyers. The broader structure still reflects a corrective phase rather than a confirmed trend reversal. From a technical perspective, ETH remains below its key moving averages. The 50-day moving average is sloping downward and continues to cap upside attempts, while the 100-day and 200-day moving averages sit higher, reinforcing a heavy overhead supply zone between roughly $3,300 and $3,600. Each rally into this region over recent weeks has been met with renewed selling pressure, highlighting persistent distribution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters Accumulation Regime: Market Supported By Seller Exhaustion, Not Buying Surge The sequence of lower highs since the October peak near $4,700 remains intact. Although price has stabilized compared to the sharp November sell-off, the rebound so far resembles consolidation within a bearish structure rather than a new impulsive move. Volume has also moderated during recent advances, suggesting limited conviction behind the bounce. On the downside, the $2,900–$3,000 range stands out as a critical support area. A sustained break below this zone would expose Ethereum to a deeper retracement toward the mid-$2,600s. For bullish momentum to regain credibility, ETH must reclaim $3,300 with strength and hold above the declining moving averages. Until then, the chart argues for caution, with downside risks still present despite short-term stabilization. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Here’s How High The Dogecoin Price Would If It Repeats Previous Parabolic Runs",
    "body": "Dogecoin’s price action has a habit of compressing quietly before going on a massive rally, and the late-2024 rally is one of the clearest examples of that behavior. After spending weeks grinding sideways around $0.10, the meme coin transitioned into a parabolic phase that carried the price to about $0.45 in a matter of two to three months. Now, how high would the Dogecoin price go if it were to repeat that same parabolic structure? How Dogecoin’s Late-2024 Parabolic Run Played Out The 2024 rally began from a base that had formed just above $0.10, right where Dogecoin spent a long time absorbing sell pressure. Once buyers regained control, Dogecoin cleared intermediate resistance around $0.15 and $0.20 with minimal pullbacks, then entered a vertical phase that pushed it through $0.30 and to $0.45. Related Reading: Dogecoin 50% Crash: Q4 Set To End In Red As All Supports Fail The key takeaway from that period is not just the magnitude of the move, but its speed, as Dogecoin delivered a roughly 4.5x increase in a very short time window of less than four weeks. That move unfolded rapidly, with little warning, and was characterized by expanding volume, strong bullish candles on the 4-hour candlestick timeframe, and momentum indicators pressing into overheated territory. As shown in the chart below, this period was characterized by high RSI readings that pushed into the 70 to 80 range. Applying The Same Parabolic Structure Parabolic rallies often catch many investors off guard. Particularly, one of the defining features of Dogecoin’s strongest rallies is that they rarely announce themselves clearly. Since Dogecoin has performed like that before, then it is not out of proportion to expect similar performance, especially considering that it is now back to trading close to the lows that it rebounded from in late 2024. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Price Reach $1 In 2026? Analysts Reveal What To Expect If Dogecoin were to produce a similar percentage expansion from a higher base, the arithmetic would also be straightforward. Using $0.15 as a reference level, a move equivalent to the late-2024 rally would project the price to around $0.60 to $0.67. That scenario assumes the same kind of rally seen previously, where the consolidation finally gives way to a parabolic rally, not a gradual grind higher. In practical terms, a trader holding 1,000 DOGE at $0.15 would have a position valued near $150 at entry, while a move to anywhere between $0.60 and $0.67 would lift that same holding into the $600 to $675 range. These figures do not come with any suggested timeline. Instead, they serve to show how Dogecoin’s past parabolic moves would translate if the same price behavior were applied to current levels. Even under that framework, the projected move is below Dogecoin’s existing all-time high of $0.76. At the same time, separate outlooks are already pointing to a push beyond that peak, with one notable prediction expecting a move to $0.80 very soon.

    "title": "Analyst Predicts Strongest XRP Price Rally In History Is Coming, Here’s Why",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Bird has indicated that the XRP price may be on course to record its greatest rally ever. The analyst alluded to the falling Bitcoin dominance as the reason why the altcoin could surge soon enough, noting how this development has preceded previous XRP rallies. Analyst Predicts Huge XRP Price Rally On The Horizon In an X post, Bird predicted that the XRP price is set to record its strongest rally yet based on the breakdown in Bitcoin’s dominance. This came as he noted that BTC.D dropped hard the last three times when XRP went truly parabolic, in 2018, 2021, and 2024. The 2018 run was when XRP rallied to its previous all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Why XRP Is About To Experience A Legendary Next 3 Months Bird stated that after that first XRP price ATH between 2018 and 2021, the Bitcoin dominance began to trend back up. The BTC.D then backtested the trend and rebuilt strength before eventually rolling over. Once that rollover occurred, XRP went parabolic again in 2021. A similar scenario is said to have played out in 2024, as Bitcoin’s dominance dropped sharply through the trendline, briefly breaking down and triggering the surge. The analyst noted that the move in 2024 didn’t fully commit as Bitcoin’s dominance recovered and the breakdown failed. However, the attempt was enough to send the XRP price flying, reaching all-time highs. Bird reiterated that XRP is sensitive to a breakdown in Bitcoin’s dominance, even temporarily. Now, a similar move could be playing out again, which could send the XRP price to new highs. Bird stated that between 2023 and 2025, the Bitcoin dominance has trended up once more, broke down through the trend, backtested it from underneath, and is now chopping and rolling over. The analyst added that this is the same historical area where XRP has gone parabolic before, but that this time the setup is even bigger. The Altcoin Could Rally To Double Digits The analyst again alluded to the 2024 run. He stated that if a brief uncommitted breakdown in Bitcoin’s dominance was enough to send the XRP price surging, then a confirmed breakdown would be exponentially stronger. In line with this, Bird remarked that the next move is the one that sends XRP into double digits and beyond. Related Reading: Analyst Updates XRP Price Prediction: Why $16 Is Still On The Table Bird stated that the key difference is what comes next, as this next move isn’t just a fake-out or a shallow drop. Instead, it is the one where the Bitcoin dominance finally loses the trend for good and breaks down hard toward the lower boundary, around the 44 to 40% region. He added that when that happens officially, the XRP price doesn’t just run but enters true price discovery. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.14, down almost 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "Bitcoin Remains In A High-Risk Zone As Short-Term Holders Stay Underwater",
    "body": "Bitcoin is struggling to maintain the $90,000 level after a sharp rejection from the $94,000 resistance zone, keeping market sentiment sharply divided. While some analysts argue that BTC is entering a deeper corrective phase, others believe the pullback is a necessary reset before a renewed upside attempt. The current price action reflects this uncertainty, with volatility rising as buyers and sellers battle for short-term control. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tests Key Resistance While $4.7B In Sell-Side Liquidity Builds According to an analysis shared by Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s short-term risk structure remains fragile. His short-term risk chart places BTC below the Short-Term Holder (STH) Cost Basis, currently estimated near $100,200. Price is also trading beneath all major moving averages, including the 128-day, 200-day, and 365-day SMAs, reinforcing the view that the broader structure is still bearish. At current levels around $91,000, Bitcoin sits in a moderate risk zone, positioned between the STH Cost Basis and the -15% downside boundary. This positioning suggests that recent rebounds should be treated cautiously. Until BTC reclaims the STH Cost Basis, upside moves are more likely to represent technical bounces within a downward trend rather than a confirmed reversal. Conversely, a breakdown below the moderate risk boundary would signal rising downside risk and could accelerate selling pressure. As a result, the $90K–$100K range remains a critical battleground for Bitcoin’s next directional move. STH Losses Continue To Cap Bitcoin’s Upside Adler’s analysis also highlights a second critical framework: the chart tracking Bitcoin’s all-time highs alongside euphoria zones and the Short-Term Holder Market Value to Realized Value (STH MVRV) indicator. This metric measures the ratio between Bitcoin’s current market price and the average realized price of coins held by short-term investors, offering a direct view into the profitability—and behavior—of this highly reactive cohort. At present, STH MVRV sits near 0.92, well below its historical mean of roughly 1.09 and decisively under the neutral level of 1.0. In practical terms, this implies that the average short-term holder is holding an unrealized loss of about 8%. Historically, periods where STH MVRV remains below 1.0 have tended to coincide with either capitulation phases or extended consolidation ranges, rather than sustained bullish expansions. The last clear euphoria zone on this chart appeared during the all-time high update in October 2025, underscoring how far current conditions are from a speculative extreme. As long as STH MVRV remains below breakeven, short-term holders are incentivized to sell into rallies as the price approaches their cost basis. This behavior creates persistent overhead supply and reinforces structural resistance near the STH Cost Basis, close to the $100,000 level. Consequently, reclaiming that zone is not just a psychological milestone but a necessary condition for any meaningful regime shift back to a bullish market structure. Related Reading: XRP Sees Back-to-Back Liquidation Waves: Binance Absorbs Majority Of Liquidations Bitcoin Price Recovery Lacks Confirmation Bitcoin’s price action on the daily chart reflects a market still trapped in a fragile recovery attempt after a sharp rejection from higher levels. Following the failed breakout above the $94,000–$95,000 area, BTC experienced a decisive sell-off that pushed the price back toward the $85,000 zone, where buyers stepped in aggressively. This reaction marked a short-term bottom, but the subsequent rebound has so far lacked structural strength. At present, Bitcoin is trading near the $90,000–$91,000 region, a former support that has now turned into a key pivot. Price remains below the 200-day and 365-day moving averages, both of which are sloping downward and acting as dynamic resistance. The 128-day moving average has also capped recent upside attempts, reinforcing the idea that the broader trend remains corrective rather than impulsively bullish. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters Accumulation Regime: Market Supported By Seller Exhaustion, Not Buying Surge From a structure standpoint, the chart shows a sequence of lower highs since the October peak, suggesting that sellers continue to control the macro trend. Volume expanded notably during the November–December sell-off, while the current bounce is unfolding on comparatively lighter participation. This divergence implies that the move higher may be more short-covering driven than supported by strong spot demand. Unless Bitcoin can reclaim and hold above the $94,000–$95,000 resistance zone with increasing volume, the risk of another rejection remains elevated. Failure to do so could reopen the path toward the $85,000 support, where the market would once again be forced to prove its underlying strength.

    "title": "Cardano Nears End Of 2020-Style Correction: Is $5 To $10 Next?",
    "body": "Cardano (ADA) may be nearing the end of a multi-month corrective phase that closely resembles its 2020 setup, according to a new technical analysis video posted Wednesday by crypto analyst Quantum Ascend. The analyst argues that a similar “lower trendline reset” preceded ADA’s prior breakout cycle, and that several weekly indicators are now starting to turn. Cardano’s 2020 Fractal Is Back In a Jan. 7 video shared on X, Quantum Ascend said he is looking at ADA’s weekly chart through a macro, multi-leg corrective framework. “On a macro count for ADA, you’re looking at an A, B, C, D, and right now waiting on an E,” he said, framing the current market structure as the late stage of a broader consolidation rather than a fresh downtrend. That “E” leg matters in their model because it effectively marks the final phase of a wedge-like compression. Quantum Ascend pointed to an upper trendline, Fibonacci levels, and prior work published in a mid-December video to justify upside targets once the structure completes. “Essentially you have upper trendline, you have some Fib stuff in play, I have a conservative of five bucks, primary up there at $10,” he said. “And then after that, I think it gets ugly for crypto for a little while, so still a believer that alt season is ahead of us.” Related Reading: Is Cardano Entering a New Phase? Technical Strength, ETF Watch, and Ecosystem Direction Align The core of the argument, however, wasn’t the targets themselves, it was the claimed resemblance to an earlier Cardano correction. Quantum Ascend overlaid a historical “fractal” to highlight comparable price behavior: a move up to a similar level, a pullback, another push into resistance, and then a wick that tagged roughly the same area on the overlay. “This correction right here that I just took this from, look at how similar it is to that correction that we just had,” he said. “Obviously it’s not perfect, but if you tried to get it close from a price structure standpoint… look where that wick on 10.10 went, exactly right there.” In the analyst’s telling, that prior pattern was the market’s way of forcing ADA down to establish a lower trendline before the next expansion. “So this is the same exact move that Cardano had to come down to set the lower trendline,” he said. “So right now setting the lower trendline, before it went on a blast off.” He then referenced the scale of Cardano’s last major run as a reminder of what altcoin cycles have historically looked like when momentum turns. “And how far did it end up running? Well, it ended up going 170X from that point in time, from a penny all the way up to $3,” Quantum Ascend said, using that move as context for why double-digit targets don’t automatically fall into the “impossible” bucket during late-cycle expansions. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Addresses ADA Dump Rumors, Is He Behind The 80% Price Crash? The more immediate claim is that the upside implied by a $10 target is not unprecedented in percentage terms compared with prior alt cycles. “When you’re looking at how far that $10 mark is from where we’re at right now, I mean 22X, right? 25X,” he said. “What was this alt season back here? This alt season was just 2021… That was a 21X… So it’s not unreasonable to be looking for 24X there. And then even on the conservative side, more of a 12X.” On indicators, Quantum Ascend highlighted early signs of a weekly momentum shift rather than a confirmed breakout. “You have a completed ABC. This thing’s ready to turn back around,” he said, adding that broader market conditions looked supportive of a bounce. The analyst also pointed to the weekly RSI beginning to lift after an extended period near lows. “Look at the RSI here on the weekly, finally starting to curl up off the floor. We’ve been down on the floor since October 27th that week, finally getting a little juice.” The analyst described negative momentum as “been decreasing,” and referenced an “ABC” structure on MACD as another piece of the same turning narrative. “A lot of these major moves happen when the weekly RSI goes from low to high,” Quantum Ascend said, arguing that higher timeframes can be slower but more reliable when they finally rotate. Quantum Ascend closed by saying he remains constructive on the project even without a current position. “I am a big believer in this project. I don’t hold any right now. It’s just the way that my portfolio has worked out,” he said. “But I do believe that there’s going to be some massive upside coming to Cardano.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.3925.
