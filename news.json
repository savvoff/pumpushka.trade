    "body": "Bitcoin suffered a sudden and deep drop in November, losing nearly a quarter of its value and wiping out over $1 trillion across the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sudden Volatility Jump Signals Options Could Be Calling The Shots—Analyst Whales Trim Positions Before Crash According to on-chain data from CryptoQuant, large holders played a central role. Wallets holding between 1,000–10,000 BTC pared back their stakes in the weeks leading up to the fall. Those big sellers took profits after the October rally, and in many cases selling was steady rather than panicked. When large players step back like that, market depth can vanish quickly. A quick overview of Bitcoin’s price decline shows prices slid from record highs above $126,000 in October to roughly $81,000 at the lowest point, before a partial bounce to $87k was recorded. Traders and funds were caught off guard by the speed of the move. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $87,086, up 1.5% in the last 24 hours. Retail Selling Added To Pressure Based on reports, small wallets also leaned toward safety. Holders under 10 BTC and groups up to 1,000 BTC reduced positions, removing another layer of potential buyers. Has Bitcoin Found Its Bottom? Cohorts Tell the Whole Story “BTC may have formed a local bottom, supported by a strong rebound and accumulation from: 100–1k BTC holders. >10k BTC holders. However, the crucial 1k–10k BTC cohort is still distributing, preventing a full… pic.twitter.com/dGU4CBD1Bw — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 25, 2025 Buying interest from casual investors was weaker than expected. Mid-sized holders — those with 10–100 and 100–1,000 BTC — did buy during the correction, and their activity helped slow the slide. Still, their buying power was not enough to match the large outflows. Futures Liquidations Intensified The Drop Reports show that futures market dynamics turned a correction into a crash. Over a 13-day stretch, long positions were forcefully closed out. That cascade removed bids and created a chain reaction of selling that pushed Bitcoin from around $105K down to $81K. Liquidations were heavy, and the selling pressure was compounded as each forced sale fed into the next. A Tentative Rebound Shows Life After the lows were hit, Bitcoin climbed back to about $87,500. This rebound has been taken by some as a sign that a local bottom might be forming. According to CryptoQuant, however, the recovery cannot be considered secure while the 1,000–10,000 BTC group keeps reducing holdings. The market’s health was being tested by who chose to sell and who chose to buy. Bottom Status Hinges On Whale Activity Market watchers say a true reversal needs selling from large wallets to stop. If those whales pause, mid-sized buyers might build a firmer floor and confidence could return. If selling continues, lower levels may be explored once again. The coming sessions will be watched closely by traders who want to see whether large holders change course or keep cashing out. Related Reading: Bitcoin Creator Somehow Becomes ‘Poor’ By Losing $41 Billion Without Saying A Word For now, the situation is simple and tense at the same time: prices have recovered slightly, but the structural weakness that allowed a 25% fall was exposed. Bitcoin could face further losses after its recent crash, if CryptoQuant’s data is anything to go by. Large holders have been taking profits, while retail investors have also been selling, leaving fewer buyers to support the market. Analysts say the next move will depend on whether these big holders continue selling or if mid-sized buyers step in to stabilize prices. Featured image from Vecteezy, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Best Crypto Presales to Buy as Metaplanet Ignores Losses, Takes $130M Loan for Bitcoin Dip",
    "body": "What to Know: Best Wallet Presale marries Fireblocks MPC-CMP security with a mobile-first UX, Upcoming Tokens portal, and fee discounts for $BEST holders. With over $17.5 million raised and dynamic staking rewards, Best Wallet positions itself as a serious contender in the multi-chain wallet race. Maxi Doge blends meme culture with structured trading competitions, a dynamic APY model, and a funded treasury to support long-term community growth. Remittix targets real-world remittances, combining CertiK-audited smart contracts, CEX listings, and broad fiat coverage to streamline cross-border payments. Bitcoin just printed one of its sharpest retracements of the year, shedding around 30% since notching fresh highs in early October. Instead of de‑risking, Tokyo-listed Metaplanet is doubling down, taking a $130M loan to buy even more $BTC and effectively leveraging its existing holdings. That kind of aggressive treasury strategy is bullish for Bitcoin’s long-term narrative but brutal for balance sheets tied too tightly to spot prices. A number of digital asset treasuries are now sitting on sizeable drawdowns and seeing the impact in equity volatility and governance pressure across the sector. For many investors, the message is simple: holding only $BTC on the corporate or personal balance sheet is a concentration risk. In corrections like this, capital often rotates toward high-conviction presales that can outrun Bitcoin on a percentage basis if the next leg higher plays out as expected. That’s where this current cycle looks interesting. Some of the best crypto presales in the market are not just meme-driven liquidity grabs; they’re building actual infrastructure in wallets, trading communities, and cross-border payments. Below are three presales and early-stage tokens that are catching this rotation, led by Best Wallet Presale ($BEST) , which is a direct play on the wallet layer of Web3. 1. Best Wallet Presale ($BEST) — The Next Gen Crypto Wallet If Metaplanet is the poster child for balance-sheet Bitcoin, Best Wallet Presale ($BEST) is a bet on the rails that everyday users actually touch. The project wants to capture 40% of the crypto wallet market by the end of 2026 by becoming the easiest, safest, most feature‑dense wallet on mobile. Instead of choosing between custodial convenience and clunky non-custodial UX, Best Wallet integrates Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP infrastructure for institutional-grade key management into a consumer-friendly, mobile-first app. Users can build custom multi-wallet portfolios across multiple chains, with a Rubic-powered DEX aggregator for best execution. Where it really differentiates itself in a risk-on presale cycle is discovery. The Upcoming Tokens portal curates early-stage launches and streamlines the presale participation flow, allowing you to access vetted early token opportunities directly from your wallet. That matters when investors are hunting the ‘next one’ without wanting to chase every Telegram link and sketchy landing page. You can dive deeper into the token’s fundamentals in this recent analysis. On the token side, $BEST holders get reduced transaction fees across the ecosystem and access to higher-yield options via a built-in staking aggregator. There’s an 8% allocation (800M tokens) reserved for staking rewards, with a dynamic APY based on a user’s share of the pool, and immediate staking is already live for presale buyers. Learn how to buy $BEST to start staking today. That mix is clearly resonating. The presale has already raised $17.5M with tokens at $0.026005, positioning Best Wallet among the cycle’s largest wallet-focused raises. For a longer-term view on where the token could trade post-launch, see this Best Wallet price prediction . If you’re comparing wallet plays in this drawdown, it’s worth digging deeper into how Best Wallet’s Fireblocks MPC-CMP stack and presale access machine could reprice the category. Learn more about Best Wallet Token. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) — High-Octane Meme Trading Community If Bitcoin leverage is moving off-chain into corporate treasuries, meme culture is still where retail tests its risk tolerance. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) leans directly into that with a ‘never skip leg-day, never skip a pump’ brand that wraps 1000x energy into a community-first meme ecosystem. Rather than just vibing on memes, Maxi Doge emphasizes trader identity. The project bills itself as a 240‑lb canine juggernaut representing the leveraged degen mindset, then backs it with holder-only trading competitions, leaderboards, and rewards designed to gamify high-conviction trading behavior without needing actual 1000x perpetuals. The tokenomics are tuned for engagement and runway. A Maxi Fund treasury supports liquidity and partnership deals, while a dynamic APY staking mode (currently sitting at 73%) rewards longer-term conviction in the community. That gives $MAXI more structural depth than the average meme coin that dominated earlier cycles. Money is noticeable here, too. The presale has raised $4.2M with tokens priced at $0.00027, a level that still leaves psychological room for the ‘many zeros’ meme crowd while funding real ecosystem development. To learn more, check out our guide on how to buy $MAXI. If you think culture remains the leading indicator for liquidity, Maxi Doge is an obvious candidate on the meme side of this rotation. For traders who want meme exposure that is explicitly built around trading competitions and treasury-backed expansion, Maxi Doge offers a differentiated angle versus yet another dog with no roadmap. Check out the Maxi Doge presale. 3. Remittix (RTX) — DeFi Rails for Global Crypto Remittances While Metaplanet borrows against BTC to stack more, another big use case for crypto remains unsolved at scale: making cross-border money transfers cheaper and faster without forcing users to care about gas fees or bridges. Remittix ($RTX) is an Ethereum-based DeFi project built specifically for crypto‑to‑fiat remittances. The protocol focuses on crypto-to-bank transfers with real-time FX conversion, allowing users to send from supported cryptocurrencies and have receivers receive fiat in their local bank accounts. Its mobile wallet reportedly supports 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies across more than 30 countries, positioning Remittix as a specialist remittance rail rather than a general-purpose DeFi wallet. Security and listings are already part of the story. CertiK has audited Remittix smart contracts , and the token has confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank, which can help with post-presale liquidity. The team has also lined up a $250K giveaway campaign around its Q3 2025 wallet beta launch, using incentives to bootstrap user adoption. In terms of capital raised, Remittix is one of 2025’s standout presales, reportedly pulling in over $24.5M and ranking as a top pre-launch token by volume. For investors looking beyond price action into real-world payment rails, Remittix offers a complementary thesis to wallet and meme plays: turning volatile crypto into local fiat with minimal friction. Learn more on the official Remittix site. Recap : As Metaplanet levers up on Bitcoin after a 30% drawdown, capital is rotating into high-conviction presales with clear narratives. Best Wallet Token , Maxi Doge , and Remittix each target different parts of the stack, with Best Wallet’s Fireblocks-powered, presale-focused app standing out as the most infrastructure-driven bet.

    "title": "Best Crypto to Buy After Bitcoin Whale Bets $2 Billion on Market Rebound",
    "body": "What to Know: Bitcoin Hyper uses a modular Bitcoin L1 + SVM L2 design to deliver high-speed, low-fee smart contracts secured by Bitcoin settlement. Presale-stage projects like Bitcoin Hyper and PEPENODE offer high-beta upside if whale-led Bitcoin accumulation evolves into a full risk-on altcoin cycle. PEPENODE’s mine-to-earn concept and tiered virtual node rewards add a game layer to the memecoin thesis ahead of the next meme rotation. Shiba Inu’s Shibarium, ecosystem tokens, and ETF inclusion show how meme-origin assets can evolve into institutional-facing Web3 platforms. Bitcoin whales just injected more than $2B into fresh BTC exposure, a bold move at a time when retail traders are still de-risking after months of chop, liquidations, and sideways boredom. For deep-pocketed players, this combination of capitulation and discounted pricing is exactly when the risk-reward flips back toward accumulation. We’re witnessing a notable divergence: smaller wallets are continuing to step back from spot and derivatives markets, while large addresses are quietly scaling in, and ETF flows are showing early signs of stabilizing. Historically, that rotation has preceded some of Bitcoin’s sharpest recovery phases, driven by a tightening of supply and a resumption of liquidity-hunting momentum once it returns. If that script repeats, it won’t just be BTC moving higher. When Bitcoin finds a base and pivots, it tends to pull high-conviction altcoins, early-stage infrastructure projects, and high-beta meme ecosystems up with it. The window before sentiment officially flips is usually when asymmetric bets hit hardest. Against that backdrop, three very different plays are emerging as early beneficiaries of a potential rebound, a mix that fits neatly into the current search for the best crypto to buy now : Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) with its high-speed Bitcoin Layer-2 narrative, PEPENODE as a mine-to-earn meme-infrastructure hybrid gaining traction, and Shiba Inu, which continues evolving into a more mature ecosystem with growing institutional recognition. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) — First Bitcoin Layer 2 With SVM Speed Bitcoin Hyper is pitching itself as the first true Bitcoin Layer 2, engineered to tackle three of Bitcoin’s biggest structural limitations in one shot: slow confirmations, high L1 fees during congestion, and the lack of native smart contracts. The solution is a modular architecture that keeps Bitcoin L1 for settlement while shifting execution to a high-speed SVM-powered Layer 2. Rather than forcing Bitcoin to behave like an all-purpose chain, $HYPER bolts Solana-grade performance onto Bitcoin’s security base. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine , developers can deploy fast, parallelized smart contracts that rival, and in some cases surpass, Solana on raw execution throughput, while still anchoring finality to Bitcoin. SPL-compatible tokens port natively to the L2, lowering the friction for projects migrating from the Solana ecosystem. For users, this opens the door to instant, low-fee payments in wrapped BTC, plus a full DeFi stack, swaps, lending markets, and staking protocols that Bitcoin has never supported natively. NFT platforms, gaming projects, and high-throughput dApps can be built using a Rust-based SDK designed for teams already familiar with Solana tooling but who want Bitcoin’s monetary premium and credibility. On the market side, demand has been unmistakable. The Bitcoin Hyper presale has crossed $28.5M raised, with tokens priced around $0.013335, putting it firmly on the radar of early infrastructure investors, especially those now searching for how to buy $HYPER before the next stage unlocks. Two high-net-worth wallets accumulated roughly $396K in recent weeks, including a single $53K buy , the kind of early whale activity that typically signals conviction, not speculation. Staking activates from TGE with high-APY rewards (41% currently), instant access for presale participants, and a short 7-day vesting window. And for anyone still asking what Bitcoin Hyper is , the reward model is designed to scale with both capital staked and ecosystem participation, nudging holders toward long-term alignment rather than short-term flipping. You can join the $HYPER presale here. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) — A Mine-to-Earn Memecoin Built on Node Economics For investors who want meme exposure without relying purely on virality, PEPENODE takes a different route. It blends meme culture with mine-to-earn mechanics, giving holders an actual system to participate in rather than a passive buy-and-pray model. Users operate virtual nodes, level them up, and earn tiered rewards based on engagement, creating a structure that feels closer to early Bitcoin mining culture, just gamified for the modern meme cycle. The setup is simple but effective: a dashboard tracks your virtual mining activity, while a tiered node system determines how much of the emissions or rewards you capture. Higher-tier nodes earn more, meaning early entry and consistent participation can potentially unlock larger upside. It’s a memecoin, but with a built-in engine that rewards activity instead of pure hype. On the fundraising front, the presale has already pulled in over $2.2M, with tokens priced at $0.0011638, modest compared with major infrastructure plays but strong for a narrative-driven meme project still in distribution. Our $PEPENODE price prediction suggests it could reach $0.0077 by the end of 2026 if the mine-to-earn narrative gains traction. And with whales positioning for a broader market rebound, even small capital inflows into meme-adjacent experiments can trigger big percentage moves. There’s no formal staking program yet, which makes PEPENODE a pure speculation and gamified-yield play rather than a yield-maximization platform. But that’s also the appeal: if mine-to-earn catches fire with retail during the next meme rotation, token prices don’t need to move far to generate outsized returns. Explore the PEPENODE presale here. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB) — A Meme Brand Turning Into a Full Web3 Stack Shiba Inu (SHIB) may have launched as a pure meme, but it has steadily transformed into a broad Web3 ecosystem spanning DeFi, payments, and infrastructure. The backbone of that evolution is Shibarium, the project’s EVM-compatible Layer 2 designed for low-cost, high-throughput transactions. By offloading activity from the Ethereum mainnet, Shibarium gives the Shiba ecosystem room to scale while preserving its connection to the wider EVM universe. The ecosystem now stretches well beyond SHIB. Tokens like BONE, LEASH, and TREAT support governance, liquidity incentives, and additional utility layers, while ShibaSwap provides the DeFi foundation for swapping, liquidity pools, and yield tools. A pipeline of privacy-enhanced smart contracts and broader Web3 modules adds to the long-term ambition: converting one of crypto’s largest communities into a functioning, self-sustaining platform. Institutional validation has also started to crystallize. On October 22, 2025, Shiba Inu appeared in T. Rowe Price’s proposed US SEC–filed Active Crypto ETF, marking one of the clearest signals yet that major asset managers view SHIB as more than a meme; they see it as a liquid, brand-strong asset suitable for traditional investment products. For investors, that combination, a sticky global community, a working Layer 2, a growing dApp stack, and early ETF exposure, positions SHIB as a more conservative meme-side allocation compared with presale-stage tokens. It may not move like a microcap, but it can serve as a solid satellite position if a broader altcoin rotation follows the whales’ $2B Bitcoin bet. Learn more on the official Shiba Inu site. Recap: Bitcoin whales are leaning into a rebound with more than $2B in fresh exposure, and that kind of conviction has historically spilled into high-upside altcoins. In this setup, Bitcoin Hyper , PEPENODE , and Shiba Inu each tap a different angle of the opportunity, Bitcoin Hyper as the pure infrastructure play bringing Solana-level speed to Bitcoin, PEPENODE as a high-beta mine-to-earn meme experiment, and SHIB as the established ecosystem now earning institutional attention. For those positioning early, the $HYPER and PEPENODE presales offer the most asymmetric setups while SHIB serves as the steadier ecosystem anchor.

    "title": "Kevin Hasset Takes Pole Position for Future Fed Chair, Best Wallet to Benefit?",
    "body": "What to Know: A Hassett-led Fed under a Trump administration could mean earlier rate cuts and a more tolerant crypto stance, boosting risk-asset demand globally. Wallets sit at the front line of any new adoption wave, but many incumbents remain either highly centralized or overly complex for retail users. Best Wallet targets these gaps with MPC-secured, mobile-first UX plus tokenized perks, aiming for 40% global crypto wallet market share by end-2026. If US policy genuinely softens, infrastructure tokens tied to wallets, on-ramps and aggregators may see renewed interest alongside large-cap Layer-1 assets. Kevin Hassett stepping into pole position as President Donald Trump’s preferred candidate for the next Fed Chair is more than a personnel story; it’s a regime shift signal. That’s because Kevin Hassett isn’t a neutral party. He’s strongly pro-crypto, a stakeholder in Coinbase, and has gone on record as wanting to cut rates now. Analysts are excited, and markets are already gaming out a tilt toward earlier rate cuts, looser dollar liquidity, and a friendlier stance toward digital assets and financial innovation. For crypto, that combination typically acts as rocket fuel. Lower real yields reduce the opportunity cost of holding volatile assets like Bitcoin and Ether, while a less hostile regulatory tone lowers headline risk for exchanges, stablecoins and token issuers. If you’re already positioned in crypto, you’re effectively front‑running a potential pivot in US monetary and regulatory policy. But cheaper liquidity alone doesn’t onboard the next 100M users. What actually determines whether new capital sticks is infrastructure: wallets, ramps and applications that feel safe, intuitive and rewarding for everyday users, not just DeFi natives. That’s where the next competitive cycle is likely to play out if a Hassett-led Fed normalizes the macro backdrop. In that context, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is positioned as a bet on the wallet layer rather than just another speculative token. The Best Wallet app aims to pair institutional‑grade security with mobile‑first UX and presale access, pitching itself as a gateway product for the next wave of mainstream adoption if regulatory clouds clear. As the macro narrative evolves, you’re likely to see more attention on which wallet ecosystems can actually capture and retain this inflow. That shift from trading coins to owning rails puts projects like Best Wallet in a very different category than short‑cycle meme coins or one‑off DeFi farms. How A Hassett Fed Could Reshape Crypto Wallet Demand If Hassett does take the chair, markets would likely price in a faster path to policy easing and a softer line on digital assets. That combination historically correlates with higher trading volumes, exchange sign‑ups, and first‑time wallet downloads as retail traders re‑enter the market looking for beta. Most of those newcomers won’t start on hardcore DeFi. They’ll land in retail‑friendly wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet or Coinbase Wallet, which act as default gateways. Yet these incumbents either lean heavily centralized, with KYC and recovery tied to a single provider, or remain clunky for mobile‑first users who expect a Web2‑grade experience. This is the opening innovative wallet ecosystems like Best Wallet are chasing. The Best Wallet Token presale enters this crowded field trying to solve for security, UX and upside participation in one stack, rather than forcing you to choose. Why Best Wallet Token Is Leaning into the Next Cycle Where many wallets simply custody assets and route swaps, Best Wallet Token is trying to build an integrated environment for what a more permissive US policy regime might unleash. The project’s core claim is ambitious: capture up to 40% of global crypto wallet market share by the end of 2026 by offering the easiest, safest and most feature‑rich mobile experience. On the security side, Best Wallet plans to be the first fully integrated Fireblocks MPC‑CMP wallet in the retail segment, bringing institutional‑grade multi‑party computation to everyday users. In practice, that means key material is split across multiple parties and devices, removing the single private‑key failure point that has plagued traditional non‑custodial wallets for a decade. Beyond security, the wallet leans into discovery and execution. A built‑in Upcoming Tokens portal is designed to simplify presale participation by curating and vetting early‑stage opportunities, while a Best DEX aggregator – powered by Rubic – routes trades across 200+ DEXs and 20 cross‑chain bridges. That’s aimed squarely at the cross‑chain fragmentation you probably feel every time you move between ecosystems. The $BEST token underpins this ecosystem with real utility: reduced fees inside the Best Wallet stack, boosted yields via a staking aggregator, governance rights, and preferential access to curated presales. The presale has already raised $17.5M, with tokens currently priced at $0.026005 and staking at 75%, suggesting growing demand for exposure to the wallet layer of the stack. To join in, discover how to buy $BEST. On‑chain data shows significant whale transactions (as verified on-chain), including one of $70.2K. This hints at the fact that some smart money is positioning early around the thesis that wallets, not just Layer-1s and Layer-2s, could be prime beneficiaries of a friendlier US policy environment. If you share that view, this cycle may be less about chasing every new token and more about choosing the right rails. That cycle could benefit $BEST incredibly – our $BEST price prediction sees the token potentially reaching $0.05106175 by the end of 2026. Research, then decide whether $BEST fits your risk profile. But hurry – the Best Wallet Token presale closes in less than two days. 🚀 Join the $BEST presale while you still can.

    "title": "Next Crypto to Explode? 2 Days Left of Best Wallet Token’s $17.5M Presale",
    "body": "What to Know: Today’s crypto wallets often force a choice between custodial risk or clunky non-custodial UX, with limited benefits beyond basic storage and transfers. Best Wallet offers access to 330 DEXs across 30 bridges in a non-custodial ecosystem and plans several future features, including the Best Card. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) raised over $17.5M in presale and only has two days left on the clock before $BEST hits exchanges. $BEST could deliver a 95% ROI by 2026 if you invest today, possibly more if investors rally behind Best Wallet. Crypto wallets are quietly becoming one of the most important battlegrounds in Web3. As on-chain activity spreads across dozens of networks and use cases, users aren’t just asking for a place to park coins anymore – they want secure, mobile-first hubs that unlock trading, yield, and payments in a single experience. At the same time, the current wallet landscape is stuck in a trade-off. Centralized wallets introduce counterparty and KYC risk, while many non-custodial options feel clunky on mobile, offer little beyond send/receive, and make presales or cross-chain swaps painful for everyday users. That gap is where Best Wallet is positioning itself. The project is pitching $BEST as the utility token behind a next-gen, all-in-one wallet that blends institutional-grade security with real user perks. Instead of just storing assets, Best Wallet is designed to help you discover new presales, move across 330 DEXs and 30 bridges via an integrated DEX aggregator, and earn yield through staking and fee discounts inside its ecosystem. With the presale entering its final stretch and only two days left of early pricing, attention is turning to whether this could be one of the next crypto to explode . Best Wallet Targets the All-In-One Crypto Super App Best Wallet aims to become the easiest and safest way for any crypto user to manage their portfolio, not just hold a handful of tokens. The mobile-first wallet wraps non-custodial, no-KYC access around a clean UX, custom multi-wallet portfolios, and targets 40% of the crypto wallet market by the end of 2026. Under the hood, the project leans on Fireblocks MPC-CMP key management while adding a DEX aggregator powered by Rubic, routing trades across 330 DEXs and 30 cross-chain bridges to help users source better pricing and lower slippage. Unlike legacy wallets that stop at basic swaps, Best Wallet layers in real perks like reduced fees for $BEST holders and higher APY rewards via its staking aggregator. Holds also get benefits like governance rights and early access to trusted presales before they catch steam. In terms of raw numbers, the presale is riding the highest waves. Buy $BEST today before the presale ends. $BEST Presale Numbers, Prediction, and Market Potential $BEST has raised over $17.5M in presale so far with a price of $0.026005, which already places it among the best presales of 2025. If the project captures just 5% of the global crypto wallet market, $BEST could peak fast. A realistic price prediction for $BEST , based on the wallet’s scope and utility, puts the token at $0.05106175 by the end of 2026. A sustained bull market could bring it to $0.07 by 2030, possibly higher if Best Wallet sees mainstream adoption. That translates to ROIs of 96.4% and 169% respectively, if you invest today. These are just estimates, of course, because $BEST has no theoretical upper limit; mainstream adoption and successful implementation could catapult the token beyond the highest expectations. If this sounds like something you’d like to back, read our guide on how to buy $BEST today. With just two days until the final presale phase closes, the window for early pricing is rapidly narrowing. Best Wallet’s pitch is simple: a single app where you can store, trade, stake, and access vetted presales, backed by a token that powers fee discounts and ecosystem rewards. Snag your $BEST for less while you still can. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR and manage risks wisely before investing.

    "title": "Texas Drops $10 Million On Bitcoin, Officially Buying The Dip First",
    "body": "Texas has moved public money into Bitcoin exposure, buying $5 million worth of shares in a regulated Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Related Reading: Bitcoin Creator Somehow Becomes ‘Poor’ By Losing $41 Billion Without Saying A Word According to reports, the state’s purchase was made on November 20, 2025, and it used the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to gain price exposure without immediately holding the cryptocurrency itself. The state set aside a total allocation of $10 million for its new Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Lee Bratcher, who leads the Texas Blockchain Council, confirmed the state’s crypto purchase on X. State Uses ETF As Interim Step Reports have disclosed that officials chose the ETF route as a temporary measure while the state puts custody plans in place. The IBIT shares give Texas a stake that tracks Bitcoin’s market moves. Based on reports, the entry price equated to roughly $87,000 per BTC at the time of the buy. The buy represents half of the total allocation, leaving $5 million still available for future moves. TEXAS BOUGHT THE DIP! Texas becomes the FIRST state to purchase Bitcoin with a $10M investment on Nov. 20th at an approximately $87k basis! Congratulations to Comptroller @KHancock4TX and the dedicated investments team at Texas Treasury who have been watching this market… pic.twitter.com/wsMqI9HrPD — Lee ₿ratcher (@lee_bratcher) November 25, 2025 The move follows legislation passed earlier in the year. According to public records, the reserve program was created by Senate Bill 21, signed in June 2025. The law authorizes a capped budget for the reserve and sets conditions for what assets qualify. Reports have disclosed that Bitcoin met the criteria laid out in the measure, prompting the initial allocation. What Officials Say And What Comes Next According to state officials, the purchase is meant as a hedge and a way to diversify long-term holdings. An RFP process is expected to pick a custodian, with officials planning to transfer from ETF positions to direct custody once systems are ready. The request for proposals is slated for early 2026, based on public statements. Analysts noted the distinction between ETF shares and direct ownership. ETF holdings provide price exposure; they do not give the state direct control over on-chain Bitcoin wallets. That control would come only after the state completes its custody procurement and shifts assets into cold storage or similar solutions. Possible Broader Effects Market observers say the purchase is notable because it marks one of the first instances of a US state formally placing public funds into Bitcoin exposure. The amount is small relative to broader markets, yet symbolic. It may prompt other states to consider similar reserve strategies, especially where lawmakers favor diversification. Related Reading: Hamas Victims Sue Binance And CZ — Accusations Of Terror Financing Rock Crypto World Transparency And Oversight According to public filings, the state will publish details of the holdings and any custody plan updates. Oversight mechanisms built into the law require regular reporting, and the remaining $5 million allocation must follow the same rules before it is used. That reporting will be watched closely by lawmakers, taxpayers, and market watchers. The buying decision was made amid wide debate over how government bodies should handle crypto assets. Texas plans to move carefully, using regulated products first and then moving toward self-custody when the proper safeguards and vendors are chosen.

    "title": "Dogecoin Coils For A Monster 90% Breakout, Analyst Predicts",
    "body": "Dogecoin is trading inside a well-defined falling wedge on the 12-hour chart, with one technical analyst arguing that an upside breakout could trigger an 80–90% rally into the upper $0.20 range. In a fresh DOGE/USDT update shared on November 25, 2025, trader Clifton Fx (@clifton_ideas) posted a Binance 12-hour chart that spans back to late July. Dogecoin Could Rally Nearly 90% The chart is dominated by two descending trendlines that enclose price action. The upper boundary connects successive lower highs from early autumn through late November, forming a downward-sloping resistance line now running just above the latest candle around the mid-$0.15 area. The lower boundary links the major swing lows since August, creating a shallower descending support line currently located in the high-$0.12 to low-$0.13 zone. Together they form the falling wedge that Clifton highlights in his caption: “Falling wedge formation in 12h timeframe.” Within this structure, Dogecoin has produced a series of lower peaks and troughs. The October 10 sell-off is marked by a prominent red candle and a thin vertical guide, driving price into the lower boundary before a partial recovery. Through late October and November, DOGE continues to respect the wedge: every rebound stalls beneath the upper trendline, while the sell-offs find support near the lower one. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bull Run Rests On This One Price Level, Analyst Warns In mid-November, price again tests that lower boundary, with a wick reaching slightly below the $0.13 region. From there, several consecutive green candles carry DOGE back up toward the upper trendline. The latest candle in the chart is closing in to that resistance, but no clear 12-hour close above it is visible, meaning the wedge remains intact and unbroken in the screenshot. On the right side of the chart, Clifton Fx plots an upside scenario. A tall, translucent green projection box starts at the current price line near $0.15181. A measurement label attached to the box reads “0.12237 (81.14%) 12,237”, indicating a move of $0.12237, or 81.14%, from that starting point. The top of the green zone aligns just above $0.27000 and below $0.28000, implying a potential target around $0.27. Related Reading: What Happens If Dogecoin Moves Out Of This Massive Wyckoff Accumulation? Summarizing the setup, the analyst writes: “In case of an upside breakout we can see an 80 – 90% massive bullish rally in the next coming days.” The chart itself, however, is explicitly conditional: the upper wedge line has not yet been broken, and no invalidation level is drawn. For now, Dogecoin is compressed between descending resistance near $0.15 and support above $0.13, with Clifton Fx warning that a clean breakout could quickly reprice DOGE toward the high-$0.20 area. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.14988. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "The XRP price is currently at risk of a crash as crypto analyst Umair has revealed that the altcoin has formed a death cross. Notably, this same pattern formed the last time that XRP suffered a 15% crash. XRP Price At Risk With Death Cross Forming In an X post, Umair stated that a death cross was forming on the daily chart for the XRP price. He further noted that the last time the altcoin printed this setup, it crashed by 15%, which, the analyst said, lines up perfectly with a potential decline to the $1.50 range. As such, he suggested that XRP could face the same outcome, since the same ingredients have formed. Related Reading: XRP Price Will Climb Above $10 When This Happens: Analyst Umair also mentioned that the chart was building a tight range between $1.90 and $2.08, a range which he described as the entire decision maker. He explained that if the XRP price can stay inside this band and spend time there, then it could form a month-long consolidation needed for a real base. However, if the XRP price fails to hold this range, then there is nothing stopping it from crashing to the $1.50 zone, according to the crypto analyst. He noted that this is exactly where the previous breakdown logic pointed. He also raised the possibility of another scenario playing out for XRP. Umair stated that if the XRP price wicks below $1.82 but snaps back inside the $1.90 and $2.08 range, then that could mark the bottom. However, if the altcoin closes below this range, then the range loses integrity, and XRP could begin its freefall. It is worth mentioning that XRP had dropped to as low as $1.8 last week but has since reclaimed the psychological $2 level. $1.65 Could Mark The Bottom For XRP Crypto analyst CasiTrades has predicted that the macro .618 support near $1.65 is likely to mark the bottom for the XRP price. This came as she noted that the altcoin was seeing a relief bounce for subwave 4. The analyst added that she expects XRP to backtest the $2 or $2.09 resistance before heading down to complete the final wave of this correction at $1.65. Related Reading: Pundit Reveals Why XRP Price At $1,000 Is Not A Dream – ‘It’s Math’ CasiTrades noted that this aligns extremely cleanly with Bitcoin. She explained that the BTC price came close to its own macro .382 retracement but hasn’t fully made it yet. The analyst expects BTC to finish its correction at $80,000, as XRP price makes its last move to $1.65. Once those levels are hit, CasiTrades expects the structure to flip bullish fast. The analyst predicts that Bitcoin will begin its Wave 5 into new highs while the XRP price and other altcoins kick off their macro Wave 3.

    "title": "XRP 100x Rally To $225: Why The Only Place To Go Is Up",
    "body": "XRP may be positioned for a major rally that reshapes its broader market outlook. In a detailed analysis shared on X, crypto strategist Chad Steingraber outlines calculations showing how expanding ETF activity could set the stage for a 100-fold move, pushing XRP toward $225 per token. His commentary consolidates a series of demand-and-supply assessments that map the structural forces he believes define XRP’s potential rally, signaling a market phase increasingly driven by institutional participation. Mapping XRP’s Path To A 100x Rally At $225 According to Steingraber, XRP’s path to $225 follows a series of milestones. He projects a fivefold rise to $11.25, tenfold to $22.50, twentyfold to $45, fortyfold to $90, sixtyfold to $135, and ultimately a 100-fold increase to $225. Each step reflects the interaction between supply absorption and price adjustment: as ETFs acquire more XRP, price rises, moderating the rate of accumulation and maintaining balance in the market. In Steingraber’s view, the only outcome is a sharp rise in XRP’s price. Related Reading: Attack On Cardano Founder Leads To Network Halt, What Really Happened? While XRP’s current market performance shows a 1.8% decline over 24 hours and an 8.4% decline over two weeks, Steingraber emphasizes that these short-term fluctuations are minor compared to structural forces. ETF-driven demand and institutional acquisition are poised to create a supply-demand imbalance that pushes XRP far beyond its current trading range. Overall, his analysis frames XRP’s potential 100x rally to $225 as a structural outcome of institutional participation, ETF inflows, and supply scarcity. Price increases are essential to slow the rate at which asset managers acquire the token, making the rally a logical response to market mechanics rather than a speculative prediction. How ETF Inflows Shape XRP’s Supply Dynamics Steingraber’s series of projections illustrates how XRP could be absorbed at a pace capable of significantly reducing its circulating supply within a short period. Under conservative estimates of $33.6 billion in annual inflows, he believes that most of the available XRP could be acquired within a year. More aggressive scenarios involving major asset managers such as BlackRock could see the entire circulating supply absorbed in less than six months. Related Reading: Will The Low XRP Price Force Ripple To Dump Its Holdings? Exec Answers Community To illustrate the scale of demand, he breaks down current acquisition rates: seven major funds are taking in an average of $20 million per day each, totaling $140 million daily, $700 million weekly, and $2.8 billion monthly, amounting to $33.6 billion annually. At XRP’s current price of $2.20, these inflows would allow institutions to accumulate massive quantities of the token, creating rapid scarcity. This dynamic makes a substantial price increase unavoidable, as higher prices slow accumulation under fixed allocations and prevent ETFs from depleting the market too quickly. XRP’s rising price is therefore not just a market reaction but a structural requirement to maintain balance amid large-scale institutional buy-ins.

    "title": "Ethereum ICO Whale Sells 20,000 ETH ($58M), Raising Questions Over Market Timing",
    "body": "Ethereum continues to trade below the critical $3,000 level as selling pressure intensifies and fear dominates sentiment across the crypto market. The broader downturn has pushed ETH nearly 40% below its August all-time high, raising concerns that the asset may be entering a prolonged bearish phase. Analysts who were once confident in a continued rally are now shifting their tone, warning that market structure, volatility, and liquidity conditions are beginning to resemble early-stage bear market behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze Flushes Out Late Longers as Funding Turns Negative: Classic Capitulation Signal At the same time, investor confidence is being further tested by fresh on-chain activity showing large holders reducing exposure. According to data from Lookonchain, an Ethereum ICO participant has sold another 20,000 ETH, valued at approximately $58.14 million, through FalconX just a few hours ago. With selling pressure accelerating, derivatives sentiment weakening, and long-term holders beginning to reduce positions, Ethereum now sits at a pivotal moment. Bulls must reclaim the $3,000 region to stabilize momentum, while bears argue that a deeper correction could unfold if support continues to erode. ICO Whale Selling Raises Pressure as Ethereum Awaits Direction According to Lookonchain, the wallet behind the latest sale — identified as address 0x2eb0 — is no ordinary holder. This Ethereum OG received 254,908 ETH during the ICO, paying just $79,000 at the time. At today’s prices, that allocation is worth roughly $757 million, highlighting the scale of unrealized gains still held by early participants. The recent sale of 20,000 ETH suggests that even long-standing holders with substantial profit cushions are beginning to offload coins, adding to the already fragile market environment. This selling activity is particularly impactful given the current sentiment. Ethereum has already fallen sharply from its highs, leverage has unwound across derivatives markets, and retail confidence has thinned. When an early participant with a cost basis near zero begins distributing, it sends a psychological signal that further downside is possible. Yet, some analysts argue that these sales may simply represent portfolio rotation rather than a long-term bearish stance. The coming days will be decisive, as investors watch whether Ethereum can stabilize and rebound or if selling pressure accelerates. A recovery above $3,000 could revive optimism and reset momentum, while continued weakness risks confirming a deeper downtrend for both ETH and the broader market.

The selloff pushed ETH toward the mid-$2,700s before a modest rebound, but the price remains below key moving averages, signaling that momentum continues to favor sellers. The 50-week moving average has rolled over, while the 100-week and 200-week moving averages now sit overhead, forming layered resistance that could cap any recovery attempts in the short term.

The most recent candle shows a small bounce, but with no strong volume follow-through, suggesting hesitation and lack of conviction among buyers. For Ethereum to regain bullish structure, reclaiming the $3,000–$3,200 area is essential, as this zone acted as a pivotal support throughout earlier phases of the cycle and now threatens to flip into resistance.

    "title": "Bitcoin Price Breaks Below 50-MA For The First Time This Cycle, Why A Crash To $38,000 Could Be Coming",
    "body": "According to crypto analyst Tony Severino, the Bitcoin price has broken below the 50-week Moving Average (MA) for the first time in the current cycle, triggering renewed fears of a deeper decline. With price momentum weakening and long-term trend indicators flashing bearish warning signals, the possibility of a price crash to $38,000 is becoming hard to ignore. 50-MA Breakdown To Trigger $38,000 Bitcoin Price Crash The Bitcoin price action took a decisive turn this week as the market slipped below the 50 MA for the first time in this four-year cycle. Severino noted in his technical analysis shared on X this Monday that the 50 MA has historically marked the beginning of extended downturns. He stated that following Bitcoin’s launch over 14 years ago, every time it has closed below the 50 MA, a prolonged bear market has followed. Related Reading: Financial Strategist Debunks Prediction That Bitcoin Price Will Reach $220,000 In 45 Days Severino’s price chart highlights BTC’s price performance from 2017 to date. In the past three Bitcoin bear markets, after the price fell below the 50-week MA, BTC continued to drop an additional 61%, 59%, and 67%. On average, the cryptocurrency has lost 62% from the break point. Applying the 62% drawdown to this cycle’s 50 MA level, the analyst predicts Bitcoin could soon experience a price crash to $38,000. From the cryptocurrency’s current price of above $87,000, this represents a staggering 60% decline. Additionally, it would imply a roughly 70% decline from its all-time high of more than $126,000. Severino warns that traders calling for a price bottom may be ignoring how far Bitcoin has historically fallen once this long-term trend fails. He indicated that the 50-week MA has repeatedly served as a dividing line between bullish and bearish phases, and that price slipping below it has more often led to extended periods of weakness and capitulation. Bitcoin Momentum Indicator Falls To Historic Lows A second analysis presented by Severino focuses on Bitcoin’s daily LMACD, which is now near levels not seen in more than 1,250 days. The oscillator has only pushed below this level six times since BTC’s 2017 macro peak. These past instances correspond to periods of heavy downside momentum where the cryptocurrency had yet to complete its bottoming process. Related Reading: One Of The Most Popular Bitcoin Advocates Dumps Millions In BTC, Here’s Why Looking at Severino’s price chart, the extended period without revisiting this lower bound suggests Bitcoin may be overdue for a momentum reset. The LMACD indicator’s current reading is also unusually weak historically, signaling that market momentum has not yet reached extreme pessimism. The readings further indicate that, although BTC remains in a downtrend, price corrections remain possible before a true bottom is established. According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin is trading below $87,000 amid volatile, choppy conditions that have contributed to its 24% decline over the past month.

    "title": "Tether Faces Downgrade By S&P Global Amid Concerns Over Disclosure And Assets Holdings",
    "body": "Tether, the entity behind the world’s largest stablecoin by market capitalization, USDT, has experienced a downgrade in its rating by S&P Global. This decision, made public on Wednesday, stems from what the agency describes as “persistent gaps in disclosure” and a growing allocation of “high-risk assets” within Tether’s reserves. The assets highlighted include Bitcoin (BTC), gold, corporate bonds, secured loans, and other investments, all of which entail various risks, including credit, market, interest rate, and foreign exchange vulnerabilities. Tether CEO Responds To S&P Downgrade In a recent research note, S&P Global detailed that this upgrade came as part of a new assessment scale implemented in 2023, ranging from 1 to 5. This scale evaluates the risk associated with different stablecoins. Following the assessment, S&P rated Tether’s USDT stablecoin as “5 (weak),” marking it as the lowest possible score and down from its previous rating of “4 (constrained).” S&P expressed concerns regarding the limited insight Tether provides into the creditworthiness of its custodians and counterparties. Related Reading: Has The Bitcoin Price Hit Its Bottom? Key On-Chain Data Signals Potential Rebound Ahead Despite this, Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) stating, “We wear your loathing with pride.” He argued that traditional credit rating methods used by agencies like S&P arose from a system that has faltered, leading regulators to challenge these legacy models. Ardoino contended that Tether stands out as a “overcapitalized” organization within the financial sector, claiming it does not harbor “toxic reserves.” He further suggested that S&P’s methods are better suited for conventional banks and insurers with opaque financial histories, rather than being applicable to digital asset issuers who operate under different reserve structures. Ardoino’s remarks indicate a belief that the agency’s downgrade indicates discomfort within traditional finance toward entities like Tether that aim to transcend a “broken financial system.” The firm’s CEO noted: The traditional finance propaganda machine is growing worried when any company tries to defy the force of gravity of the broken financial system. No company should dare to decouple itself from it. Largest Independent Gold Holder In the aftermath of the downgrade, Tether strongly rejected S&P’s characterizations, emphasizing its resilience through various financial crises, including banking collapses, exchange failures, liquidity challenges, and extreme market fluctuations—all while maintaining full stability and the ability to redeem USDT. Tether also pointed to its issuance of approximately $184 billion worth of USDT, assuring stakeholders that it holds sufficient reserves, including US Treasuries and other assets, to satisfy redemptions. Related Reading: Monad (MON) Price Skyrockets 80%, Emerges As Best Performer Among Top 100 Cryptos Notably, recent reports from the Financial Times reveal that Tether has emerged as the largest independent holder of gold globally, highlighting the firm’s increasing exposure to non-traditional reserve assets. According to the report, the stablecoin issuer bought more gold in the last quarter of the year than any central bank in the world. The figures show that the firm bought 26 tons of gold, adding to its substantial gold reserve of nearly 120 tons. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

Related Reading: Capriole Founder Not Bearish On Bitcoin Despite Headwinds—Here’s Why With Federal Reserve rate-cut odds now above 80%, traders are positioning for a potential shift in risk appetite that could benefit major cryptocurrencies, especially ETH. ETH's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Fed Pivot Hopes and Institutional Demand Bolster Ethereum Ethereum has traded between $2,700 and $3,300 in recent weeks, but fresh catalysts are helping the asset stabilize above $2,900. The biggest driver is macroeconomic. CME FedWatch data shows the probability of a December interest-rate cut has surged from 30% to more than 80%. Lower interest rates typically encourage investment in risk-on assets such as crypto. Institutional flows reflect that shift. U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $96.67 million in inflows on November 24, with BlackRock alone contributing $92.6 million, its first inflow in two weeks Treasury giant BitMine continues to accumulate aggressively, adding 69,822 ETH (over $200 million) last week and bringing its total holdings to 3.63 million ETH, around 3% of the circulating supply. At the same time, whale wallets holding 10,000–100,000 ETH amassed 440,000 ETH in one week, signaling renewed confidence despite broader market caution. Ethereum (ETH) Poised for a Breakout Toward $3,400 Despite trading under the 20-day SMA at $3,132, Ethereum is showing early signs of bullish momentum. The MACD histogram has crossed into positive territory, and the RSI is sitting near the neutral 50 line, with room to move higher before hitting overbought levels. Other indicators strengthen the bullish case: Bollinger Bands: ETH’s position near 0.32 suggests price is closer to the lower band, a common rebound zone. Volume: Binance 24-hour trading volume around $1.27 billion indicates enough liquidity to support a breakout. ATR: With daily ATR at $201.62, volatility remains elevated, favoring sharp upside moves if momentum builds. The first major test remains $3,132. A clean breakout and two consecutive daily closes above this level would likely trigger algorithmic buying and push ETH toward the $3,400 target within 5–7 days. Beyond that, resistance at $3,658 becomes the next upside objective. Market Risks and Short-Term Outlook While bullish momentum is building, Ethereum still trades in a broad descending channel, and market structure remains fragile. Failure to reclaim $3,132 soon could send ETH back toward $2,750, with deeper support at $2,623 and the cycle low of $2,659. Related Reading: The Bull And Bear Scenario For XRP That Could Play Out In November Broader crypto weakness, negative spot flows, or delays in network upgrades could delay a breakout. However, with rising institutional demand, whale accumulation, and rate-cut optimism, Ethereum’s probability of retesting $3,400 is steadily improving. Confidence Level medium is at Medium (65%), as ETH’s path to $3,400 remains viable but requires confirmation through key resistance levels. Cover image from ChatGPT, ETHUSD chart from Tradingview",

    "title": "Major Bitcoin LTH Sell-Off Signals Cycle Exhaustion as Supply Drops to 13.6M BTC",
    "body": "Bitcoin has struggled below the $90,000 level since last week and is now attempting to stabilize as selling pressure continues to shape market sentiment. The sharp downturn from the recent cycle high has left bullish traders on the defensive, with confidence weakening across spot and derivatives markets. Analysts who just weeks ago projected continuation toward new all-time highs are now shifting their tone, with many calling for the beginning of a bear market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze Flushes Out Late Longers as Funding Turns Negative: Classic Capitulation Signal The broader market environment has amplified these concerns. Momentum has flipped downward, liquidity has thinned, and buyers have been unable to reclaim key resistance levels that would signal strength. As Bitcoin searches for support, investors are now watching reactions around the high-$80K region to determine whether this decline is part of a deeper structural reversal or a temporary correction within the larger trend. According to top analyst Axel Adler, Long-Term Holders have played a pivotal role in the current downturn. He reports that this cohort conducted the largest profit-taking event of the entire cycle, reducing positions by 1.57 million BTC over the quarter as prices fell toward $80,000. This scale of distribution historically aligns with exhaustion phases and late-cycle tops, intensifying speculation that Bitcoin may be entering a more prolonged period of weakness. Long-Term Holder Distribution Signals Major Cycle Shift Axel Adler highlights that Long-Term Holders (LTH) are conducting massive profit-taking, pushing supply levels back to early 2023 lows. According to his data, the 30-day Net Position Change now reflects one of the deepest sell-offs seen in the entire bull cycle. LTH supply has fallen sharply from the peak of 15.75 million BTC to the current 13.6 million BTC—marking the lowest reading since the beginning of the cycle. Adler notes that this pattern aligns with a classic smart-money distribution phase often observed near major market tops. Over just the past two weeks (November 11–25), LTH sold 803,399 BTC, representing a drop of 5.54% and averaging 53,560 BTC per day. Historically, such compression in supply has only occurred during major inflection periods. Adler compares the current reading to previous extremes—March 2024, following the $73,000 all-time high sell-off, and October 2024, when Bitcoin corrected from the ATH toward $85,000. The present phase demonstrates aggressive coin dumping, with deeply negative red bars on the Net Position Change while price simultaneously declined from the October peak. This combination of rapid supply reduction and falling price suggests that LTH distribution is exerting meaningful pressure on the market. The data implies that the cycle may be transitioning toward a structurally weaker phase unless new demand re-enters to absorb the sell-side volume. Related Reading: XRP OI Collapses to Lowest Level Since Nov 2024: Binance Data Shows Liquidity Is Fading BTC Attempts Stabilization After Sharp Breakdown Bitcoin’s price action on the daily chart shows a market struggling to regain footing after a steep decline from the $120K region to a recent low near $80K. The current trading level around $86,800 reflects an attempted relief bounce, yet the broader trend remains clearly bearish. Price is positioned below the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages, all of which are now sloping downward—a structure that typically signals sustained downside momentum. The rejection from the mid-November breakdown zone reinforces the idea that former support has flipped into resistance. Related Reading: 63K Bitcoin Exits Long-Term Wallets: A Surge of Speculative Short-Term Buying Volume spikes during the selloff indicate forced liquidation and capitulation-driven selling rather than orderly distribution, while the recent bounce has occurred on noticeably lighter volume, suggesting weak conviction from buyers.

Losing this level could expose further downside toward $78K and potentially $72K. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Steps Into Its ETF Moment — Analyst Is Betting On A Rally Bigger Than Bitcoin’s",
    "body": "As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures and evolves, a new narrative is gaining traction that positions XRP for an upcoming institutional-driven surge that could redefine market expectations. With momentum building around XRP exchange-traded funds, one prominent analyst now believes the asset could be on the verge of a rally so large it may outperform Bitcoin’s own ETF-driven surge. Why Analysts Believe XRP Is Poised For A Larger Upside Than Bitcoin XRP is entering its ETF chapter, and the scale of what’s coming could make Bitcoin look small. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull mentioned on X that early players like Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin, and Canary Funds are already live with their XRP products. Meanwhile, the real power players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and the other giants haven’t even filed for an XRP spot ETF yet, which shows this is just a warm-up. Related Reading: Here’s Why A Supply Shock Could Be Imminent For XRP The heavyweights haven’t even stepped into the arena, and the initial institutional capital is already flowing. Spot ETFs were highly beneficial for BTC, which triggered a trillion-dollar shockwave that attracted Wall Street institutions and momentum traders who couldn’t ignore the access. According to Xfinancebull, XRP is a different beast, with functional utility, real-world adoption, and banking infrastructure already built out across Japan and Asia. The capital that will soon flood into XRP via ETFs won’t just speculate, but it will stay. When a fraction of over $80 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM) from these initial titans begins to rotate into XRP, the inflows could be significant. This is cold, hard math that is about to unlock high levels of liquidity and historically repeat the move on a larger scale. “The XRP spot ETF ignition is not coming, but it is already here. If you missed the Bitcoin momentum move, don’t miss this one,” Xfinancebull noted. An analyst known as RipBullWinkle has also highlighted that Bitcoin has leaked $151 million, while XRP led all inflows with $164 million. That’s not random, it’s institutions reallocating with intention into assets built for settlement and speed. When powerhouses like Franklin Templeton and Grayscale pull over $130 million into XRP on day one, it confirms where the institutional smart money is going. Market Stabilization Signals The Start Of A New Upward Leg Bitcoin and altcoins are reacting sharply to momentary declines after the brief pullback. TerraHaberTr has stated that BTC has reclaimed the $87,000 level, and if momentum continues at this pace, BTC will target $90,000 and $100,000 levels. On the altcoin side, the recovery is happening even faster, and altcoins that have experienced deep dips may start to gain strength. Related Reading: XRP Price Will Climb Above $10 When This Happens: Analyst Meanwhile, XRP is gaining traction as it pushes back above $2.20. If the move continues, XRP could reach the $3.00 region. Overall, opportunities have continued to emerge across major altcoins. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how XRP has bounced off the bottom level of a Parallel Channel and could be headed toward its midway line. XRP Recently Found Support At The Lower Line Of A Parallel Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a technical analysis (TA) pattern forming in the 3-day price of XRP. The pattern in question is a “Parallel Channel,” appearing whenever an asset’s price consolidates between two parallel trendlines. Related Reading: Capriole Founder Not Bearish On Bitcoin Despite Headwinds—Here’s Why The upper level of the channel provides resistance to the asset, making tops probable at it. Similarly, the lower line can facilitate bottom formations by acting as a source of support. A breakout of either of these bounds can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. There are a few different types of Parallel Channels, but the one of interest here is the most basic version: a channel that’s parallel to the time-axis. This type corresponds to a phase of true sideways movement in the price. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the 3-day price of XRP has been stuck inside for the past year: As is visible in the above graph, XRP witnessed a failed breakout beyond the upper line of the Parallel Channel back in July. This kicked off a phase of downtrend for the cryptocurrency, which culminated in a retest of the channel’s lower line earlier in November. The coin has since observed a rebound, a potential sign that the support level of the Parallel Channel is holding up. The analyst thinks that the cryptocurrency may now be heading toward the midpoint of the pattern, located at $2.60. From the current price of the asset, a rally to this level would mean an increase of almost 20%. It now remains to be seen whether the coin’s surge will continue, or if it will retrace back to the support line again. Related Reading: XRP Jumps 7%, But Watch Out For Speculative Froth Something that could make the latter scenario more likely is profit-taking from the whales. As Martinez has highlighted in another X post, the large XRP holders carrying between 1 million and 10 million tokens participated in distribution during the asset’s latest recovery surge. As displayed in the chart, XRP whales reduced their supply by more than 180 million tokens (worth $391 million at the latest exchange rate) alongside its 17% price rally. This selloff was only a continuation of the trend from earlier in the month, and could be a potential sign that the sentiment among big-money traders hasn’t changed despite the rebound. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.17, down 1.5% over the last 24 hours. Featured image from Dall-E, Santiment.net, charts from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin ETF Debut Fails To Impress, Taking In Only $1.4 Million",
    "body": "According to trading records and company filings, Grayscale’s new spot Dogecoin ETF — ticker GDOG — opened quietly, pulling in just $1.4 million in trading volume on its first day on NYSE Arca. Related Reading: Fear Surges, But Real XRP Holders Aren’t Shaken—Analyst Muted Debut On NYSE Arca Reports have disclosed that the debut fell well short of some public forecasts. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas had suggested the fund might see roughly $10–12 million in opening-day volume, a target that the actual figures did not meet. That gap has drawn quick commentary from traders and analysts, who say the launch exposure was smaller than expected for a high-profile first spot product. Grayscale’s paperwork shows the ETF began life with holdings of about 11 million DOGE and roughly 94,700 shares outstanding, with assets under management reported at roughly $1.7 million at the time the fund started trading. The sponsor set a management fee of 0.35%, but that charge is being waived — the fund will carry a 0% expense ratio either until it reaches $1 billion in assets or for the first three months, whichever happens first. $GDOG (first Doge ETF) saw $1.4m volume on Day One.. solid for an avg launch but low for a ‘first-ever spot’ product. Not too surprising tho, we actually made a rhyme a while ago predicting this: ‘The further away you get from BTC, the less asset there will be.’ pic.twitter.com/ermlOcID1J — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 25, 2025 Market Shifts To Other Altcoins Based on reports from market trackers, other recent altcoin ETFs saw stronger early demand, leaving GDOG’s debut looking muted by comparison. Some XRP and Solana vehicles drew faster inflows during their openings, and that contrast has been used to explain why meme-coin exposure did not attract as much fresh cash on day one. Traders say that where money goes now may reflect a preference for certain tokens over meme-style names in regulated wrappers. What Investors Are Watching Next Observers note a few things to watch: whether the fee waiver helps the fund gather assets in the coming weeks, how DOGE’s market price behaves as more products list, and whether competing Dogecoin ETFs — including a product from Bitwise — change the flows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Creator Somehow Becomes ‘Poor’ By Losing $41 Billion Without Saying A Word Some analysts are watching short term creation and redemption activity and the order books around the ETF to judge real demand versus headline interest. Dogecoin’s spot market showed mild movement after the listing, trading near $0.15 as the ETF opened. That price action suggests traders reacted but did not rush in, and it leaves the question of long-term institutional appetite open. Based on the data so far, GDOG’s quiet first day is a clear signal that listing alone does not guarantee big capital flows. The next few weeks — when the fee waiver is still active and competing listings arrive — will be key to see whether the fund can widen its reach or remain a subdued debut in a busy ETF calendar.

    "title": "Dogecoin (DOGE) Shows Controlled Strength as Traders Eye Key Resistance Above",
    "body": "Dogecoin started a steady increase above $0.150 against the US Dollar. DOGE is now consolidating and might correct lower to $0.1480. DOGE price started a fresh increase above $0.1450 and $0.150. The price is trading above the $0.150 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1490 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could aim for a fresh increase if it remains stable above $0.1480. Dogecoin Price Holds Gains Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above $0.1420, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE climbed above the $0.150 resistance to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above $0.1550. A high was formed at $0.1565 and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1330 swing low to the $0.1565 high. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1490 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.150 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is another increase, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1565 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.160 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1620 level. A close above the $0.1620 resistance might send the price toward $0.1685. Any more gains might send the price toward $0.1740. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.180. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1565 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1510 level. The next major support is near the $0.1480 level and the trend line. The main support sits at $0.1450 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1330 swing low to the $0.1565 high. If there is a downside break below the $0.1450 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.1380 level or even $0.1330 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.1510 and $0.1480. Major Resistance Levels – $0.1565 and $0.1600.",

    "title": "Will Crypto Explode If Kevin Hassett Takes Over The Fed In 2026?",
    "body": "Kevin Hassett, head of the White House National Economic Council, has suddenly become the market’s base case for the next Fed chair – and crypto investors are already gaming out what a “Hassett Fed” would mean. According to Bloomberg-sourced reporting, Hassett has “emerged as the frontrunner” for President Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Federal Reserve, seen as the candidate most aligned with Trump’s preference for lower interest rates. Earlier disclosures showed Hassett previously served as an adviser to Coinbase and holds at least $1 million in Coinbase stock. How Will Hassett Impact The Crypto Market? For crypto allocators, that combination of macro dovishness and direct exposure to a major US exchange is the core of the bull case. Bitwise senior investment strategist Juan Leon put it bluntly on X: “If Kevin Hassett becomes Fed Chair, the implications for crypto are strongly bullish.” He calls Hassett an “aggressive ‘dove’ who has publicly criticized current rates for being too high and advocated for deeper, faster cuts,” highlighting that he “served on Coinbase’s advisory board and owns large stake in COIN,” and that he “led the White House digital asset working group to shape pro-crypto regulation.” Related Reading: Crypto Has Entered Late-Cycle Territory, Says Global Liquidity Veteran But the potential Hassett regime cannot be separated from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s emerging blueprint for the Fed. Bessent has been openly questioning the post-crisis operating framework. As Walter Bloomberg relayed from his CNBC appearance, “BESSENT ON FED: ‘AMPLE RESERVES REGIME’ MIGHT BE FRAYING.” Forward Guidance host Felix Jauvin summarized the direction of travel in a post: “Bessent wants a fed chair that gets us out of balance sheet shenanigans and simplifying things to how they were pre-ample regime. Dovish FFR, hawkish balance sheet.” He added: “I don’t know if I can emphasize enough just how far away we are from any sort of QE copium.” That framing matters for crypto. A Hassett Fed that cuts the policy rate faster in downturns is one thing; a return to full-blown quantitative easing is another. A “dovish FFR, hawkish balance sheet” mix would still be a friendlier macro environment than the post-2022 tightening cycle, but it is not a guaranteed repeat of the 2020–2021 liquidity wave that lifted every risk asset simultaneously. Rate cuts without large-scale asset purchases support risk appetite and lower discount rates, yet they do not automatically recreate the extreme “everything rally” conditions that many in crypto implicitly associate with Fed dovishness. The political logic behind Hassett’s rise has been described most clearly by macro commentator EndGame Macro (@onechancefreedm). In a thread, he argues that “Hassett isn’t leading because he’s the most academic or the most central bankerish. He’s leading because he checks the boxes Trump actually cares about.” Related Reading: Latest Crypto Crash Wipes $1 Billion Off Trump Family’s Wealth Trump, he writes, wants someone he already trusts, who has “spent years defending Trump publicly,” and who has been “openly critical of the Fed for being too slow, too cautious, and too political.” In that framework, “markets hear dovish. Trump hears I can deliver growth again. And crypto folks hear one of us.” Markets are starting to agree. On Polymarket, contracts tracking the Fed chair race show Hassett around 53% at press time, reinforcing that shift from speculation to probabilistic base case. Whether that translates into a genuine “explosion” in crypto will depend less on personalities than on the interaction of three forces: how aggressively a Hassett Fed actually cuts, how far Bessent is willing to go in shrinking or simplifying the balance sheet, and how markets reassess inflation, term premia and fiscal risk under a more overtly political central bank. The odds market is signaling that crypto is moving closer to the center of US monetary power. The scale of any move in 2026 will be determined by the cycle – and by how a Hassett-led Fed balances “dovish rates” with “hawkish balance sheet” in practice. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $2.96 trillion. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Best Wallet Token’s $17.6M Presale Ends Tomorrow as It’s Your Last Chance to Join",
    "body": "What to Know: Most crypto wallets remain either centralized with failure points or overly technical, lacking mobile-friendly UX and meaningful user rewards or integrated benefits. Fragmented tooling forces users to juggle separate apps for swaps, staking, tracking and presales, creating friction that slows broader Web3 adoption. Best Wallet Token backs a non-custodial, multi-chain mobile wallet that integrates tracking, swaps, staking and curated presales within a single interface. By tying fee discounts, higher staking yields and presale access to $BEST, Best Wallet Token aims to turn the wallet into a full-stack Web3 opportunity hub. Crypto wallets are no longer just key-storage tools. As more users live on-chain (trading, staking, gaming and joining presales) the wallet has quietly become Web3’s most important interface. Yet most options still force you to juggle multiple apps, sacrifice control, or tolerate clunky UX that scares off newcomers. Centralized wallets can freeze accounts or become single points of failure. On the other hand, many non-custodial wallets feel designed only for power users, with confusing signing flows, limited or no presale access, and few real perks for loyal holders. You’re either giving up sovereignty or leaving obvious value on the table. Best Wallet is positioning itself as a direct answer to that gap: a non-custodial, multi-chain Web3 wallet that bundles tracking, staking, swaps and vetted presales into one mobile-first app. The thesis is simple: if the wallet is where you live, it should also be where you earn, discover and save on fees. The Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale ends tomorrow, giving a final chance to buy at presale price before listings and heavier marketing kick in. With $17.65M already raised at $0.026005 per token, there’s already strong demand for a wallet that aims to capture 40% of the crypto wallet market share by the end of 2026. Learn more about what is Best Wallet Token. Best Wallet Bundles Web3 Into One Mobile-First Experience Best Wallet Token is backing a non-custodial, no-KYC wallet that aims to be the ‘home screen’ for your entire Web3 life. Instead of bouncing between a swap app, staking dashboard, portfolio tracker and presale platform, you manage everything inside a single, mobile-first interface designed for everyday users, not just DeFi natives. Under the hood, Best Wallet integrates Fireblocks MPC-CMP security, multi-wallet portfolios, and a DEX aggregator powered by Rubic that connects to 50+ chains, 200+ DEXs and 20 cross-chain bridges. For you, that translates to better pricing on swaps, broader asset coverage (60+ chains in the future), and fewer blind spots when moving capital across ecosystems. The standout feature is the Upcoming Tokens portal, which curates the best crypto presales and streamlines presale participation. Instead of chasing links and worrying about fake sites, you can discover vetted opportunities directly inside the wallet and pay with assets you already hold. $BEST Price Potential & Whale Interest Signal Explosive Future On-chain signals are already flashing interest from larger players. Smart money is moving, with one whale buying $16K yesterday and another adding in $13.8K 5 days ago . That kind of conviction ahead of listings often reflects a longer-term view on utility, not just a quick flip narrative around launch. Our $BEST price prediction also estimates large gains in the future, with a 2026 prediction at $0.05106175/token. That’s a 96% from today’s price of $0.026005. The tokenomics also lean into long-term alignment. $BEST holders unlock reduced fees across the Best Wallet ecosystem, higher APY opportunities through the staking aggregator, and priority access to future presales inside the Upcoming Tokens portal. An 8% allocation, or 800M tokens, is reserved for staking rewards, with dynamic proportional yields and immediate staking available during presale. Best Wallet Token is trying to turn the wallet from passive infrastructure into your primary yield and access layer. By combining non-custodial security, multi-chain swaps, tracking, staking and curated presales in one app, it targets both crypto natives looking to consolidate tools and newcomers who want a simpler on-ramp with tangible perks. Here’s how to buy $BEST now. With the presale closing tomorrow and a current raise of $17.65M, the timing window is narrow for those looking to enter at the current valuation. If you believe the next wave of adoption will be won at the wallet layer, $BEST is positioned as a direct bet on that thesis. Join the $BEST presale before it ends tomorrow.

    "title": "Metaplanet In Jeopardy: Bitcoin Needs To Surpass $108,000 By December 18 To Prevent New Crisis",
    "body": "Metaplanet, often dubbed Japan’s MicroStrategy for its adoption of Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin investment strategy, is nearing a critical juncture as Bitcoin (BTC) retraces below 30% of its all-time highs in under a month. Metaplanet Bitcoin Holdings Plummet As of November 26, Metaplanet ranks as the fourth largest public Bitcoin treasury company, holding just over 30,000 BTC valued at approximately $2.7 billion, with an average acquisition cost of around $108,000 per coin. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $87,700, placing the firm at a nearly 17% loss on its investments. The company finds itself about $640 million underwater, compounded by a steep drop in its stock price, which has plummeted 81% from June highs of ¥1,935 to its current valuation of ¥366 per share on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Related Reading: Has The Bitcoin Price Hit Its Bottom? Key On-Chain Data Signals Potential Rebound Ahead Recently, Metaplanet borrowed an additional $130 million to bolster its Bitcoin holdings, a decision disclosed in a filing on November 21 under a previously established $500 million credit facility announced in late October. This loan is structured with a floating interest rate that renews daily, allowing for repayment at any point. Importantly, the loan is fully secured by the company’s Bitcoin reserves. However, market expert Shanaka Anslem has raised concerns on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) about the implications of these maneuvers for Metaplanet’s short-term stability. Key Dates Approach Anslem highlighted two pivotal dates that the market should closely monitor: December 18, when the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will decide on interest rates, and December 22, when Metaplanet shareholders will vote on a proposed $135 million fundraising initiative. The outcomes of these events are intertwined. The expert asserts that if the Bank of Japan opts for tighter monetary policy, resulting in a strengthened yen, Bitcoin prices may decline, potentially collapsing Metaplanet’s stock premium and jeopardizing the fundraising vote. Conversely, should the central bank maintain its loose policies, leading to a weakened yen but stable Bitcoin prices, the vote may pass, allowing the company to survive. Related Reading: Monad (MON) Price Skyrockets 80%, Emerges As Best Performer Among Top 100 Cryptos This situation holds significance beyond Metaplanet itself. Japan currently lacks a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), making Metaplanet the sole avenue for Japanese investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin via the stock exchange. This factor contributed to a 4,000% increase in the company’s stock value in 2024; however, the price plunged 81% when Bitcoin dropped by 30% over the past month amid rising selling pressure that has prompted fears of a new bear market among investors. Leverage further amplifies the existing risks. For Metaplanet to break even, Bitcoin must reach $108,000. For their investment model to function effectively, however, BTC must surpass $130,000. If Bitcoin falls below $70,000, Metaplanet may have to sell assets to meet collateral requirements. Anslem further noted: For now, Metaplanet stands as neither triumph nor failure but as the most consequential experiment in corporate Bitcoin allocation currently running… The hotel company that bet everything on Bitcoin approaches its moment of truth. The world should be watching. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "An analyst has explained how Bitcoin’s bottom in the current cycle may not follow the same pattern as historical bear markets. Bitcoin Could Bottom Around True Mean Price Instead This Time In a new post on X, Checkonchain co-founder Alec Dejanovic has talked about a couple of pricing models related to Bitcoin. The first of these is the “Realized Price,” keeping track of the cost basis of the average investor on the BTC network. Related Reading: XRP Rebounds From Channel Bottom, Analyst Says $2.60 Could Be Next When the BTC spot price is trading above this level, it means that the network as a whole is in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, the asset being under the metric suggests that the average token is being held at some loss. This indicator has displayed an interesting relationship with the cryptocurrency in the past. “Historical Bitcoin bears usually bottom around the Realised Price level,” explained Dejanovic. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows this effect in action. As is visible in the graph, the 2015, 2018, and 2022 bear markets all found their bottoms when the Bitcoin spot price plunged under the Realized Price. Even the COVID crash in 2020 bottomed out below the indicator. The explanation behind this pattern could lie in the fact that below this line, the majority of the network can be considered underwater, so there wouldn’t be many profit-takers left. In these conditions, resolute entities take coins off investors capitulating at a loss and selling pressure slowly reaches exhaustion, allowing BTC to regain its footing. Today, the Realized Price is situated at $56,000. Considering the past pattern, perhaps this cycle’s bear market would also bottom out around or below this level. Dejanovic thinks things can go differently this time, however, saying, “with ETF flows remaining resilient and no FTX-style fraud in sight, that target feels excessive.” If not Realized Price, then where else could Bitcoin find its bottom? The answer may be the second price model listed in the chart: the True Mean Price. This metric functions similarly to the Realized Price, except for the fact that it represents the cost basis of just the active market participants, not the entire network. A chunk of the Bitcoin supply has become lost due to associated wallets no longer being accessible. As BTC is growing older, this supply is only increasing in size, making the Realized Price a somewhat inaccurate representation of the real network situation. Related Reading: Capriole Founder Not Bearish On Bitcoin Despite Headwinds—Here’s Why By focusing on only the active part of the supply, the True Mean Price sidesteps this issue. Its value is currently $82,000, which is around where BTC found its recent low. “This could be the new line in the sand we are hammering out,” noted the analyst. BTC Price Bitcoin has shown a sharp jump during the past day that has taken its price back above $90,000. Featured image from Dall-E, checkonchain.com, chart from TradingView.com",
