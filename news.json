    "title": "Analyst Says XRP Price Just Entered Neutral State – What This Means",
    "body": "A crypto analyst has announced that the XRP price has just entered a neutral state and could be gearing up for a major rally. He explains how this phase has historically appeared before strong rallies and outlines what the current market structure may signal for XRP moving forward. XRP Price Enters Neutral State Before Bull Rally Crypto expert and data analyst CW recently shared a fresh update on XRP’s price action, noting that the cryptocurrency has broken out from its bottom and moved into a neutral state. He said this shift marks the early stage of a larger bull rally, with a decisive move above the previous all-time high acting as the key signal for price acceleration. Related Reading: XRP Analyst Says This Is What They Aren’t Showing You, ‘Don’t Get Shaken Out’ The chart he shared shows XRP following a repeated four-phase pattern across multiple market cycles, first from 2014 to 2018 and again from 2017 to date. In the 2014 cycle, Phase 1 began with a sharp breakout to TP1, setting a new ATH. From that peak, XRP entered Phase 2, which formed a Symmetrical Triangle. During this phase, XRP moved sideways within a tightening range for several months. Phase 3 came next, marking a long consolidation period for XRP. Eventually, XRP’s price broke the upper boundary of the symmetrical triangle and entered Phase 4. In this final phase, XRP surged to TP2, reaching a second ATH at the 6.618 Fibonacci extension level. According to the chart, XRP has already completed Phases 1-3 in the current cycle and has entered Phase 4. After hitting its first peak around $3.5 (TP1) earlier in 2025, the cryptocurrency recently broke above the upper boundary of a similar Symmetrical Triangle pattern, entering a “neutral state.” Now that XRP has reached this state, CW noted that it has entered Phase 4, the final stage of the four-phase historical pattern. The analyst has projected a second new all-time high for XRP near $21.5, aligning with the 6.618 Fibonacci extension level from the 2014 cycle. How Momentum Indicators Reacted During Each Phase At the bottom of CW’s price chart is a Stochastic Oscillator and a Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram. The stochastic shows overbought and oversold conditions for each cycle. Related Reading: Analyst Breaks Down Why Investors Will Make More Money With XRP Than Bitcoin In Phase 2 of each cycle, the stochastic frequently hits oversold levels, which align with the extended consolidation and price decline observed in that period. During Phase 3, it stays around the middle range, reflecting a neutral state. Finally, in Phase 4 of the 2014 cycle, it spikes toward overbought levels, coinciding with strong price breakouts. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram mirrors momentum shifts in each phase. During Phase 1, the histogram shows strong positive bars during the initial breakout. Phase 2 saw negative bars as the price declined, signaling bearish momentum. After this, Phase 3 showed small, fluctuating bars, indicating low momentum. Lastly, in Phase 4, the histogram rapidly expands on the breakout, pushing its price to new ATHs in 2014. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Rally Reflects Buyer Conviction On Coinbase Spot Markets, Bull Run Back On?",
    "body": "The recent Bitcoin rally may be driven by real spot demand on Coinbase. Data indicating elevated spot activity on Coinbase suggests that this move higher is bolstered by direct purchases rather than leveraged positioning in derivatives markets. This distinction matters because Spot buying reflects a real capital commitment, not a temporary bet. Why Risk Management When Demand Is Structural The Bitcoin rally since Sunday’s Powell subpoena news has been largely linked to Coinbase spot buyers. Crypto trader Alex Krüger has highlighted on X that both the Adjusted Coinbase Premium and Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) show steady spot accumulation, which is exactly why this has been a true hated rally even among bitcoiners. For over a month, the dominant narrative in every crypto chat room has been that BTC is lagging while equities and commodities are moving upward. Related Reading: Analyst Outlines The Bulllish And Bearish Scenarios For Bitcoin – Here’s What To Know However, the fun fact is that equities are not accurate, but 40% of the S&P 500 (Standard & Poor’s 500) stocks have actually closed red in 2025, (39.2% to be precise). Perception is doing a lot of work here, and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) move on Powell represented a major macro litmus test for BTC. Kruger claims that the BTC long-term value proposition is about protecting against the tail risk of central bank profligacy. On Monday, BTC surged upward, although the move was just a little surge. According to Krüger, the BTC key battlefield remains the 50-week moving average (WMA), which is currently around $101,420. Meanwhile, the trader is looking to take some profits into short liquidations right above the $100,000 mark. Why Bitcoin Benefits First From Institutional Flows The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act is set for markup today, January 15th, 2026, in the Senate Banking Committee. According to the update by BTC_road_to200k on X (Formally Twitter), this is where the lawmakers will debate and shape the final version of the bill before it moves forward. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Stays Pinned Above Support, Setting Up a Bigger Move This matters because the art aims to clear up the ongoing regulatory uncertainty between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which has been a major source of hesitation for large institutional players looking to move into Bitcoin and other digital assets. Furthermore, the Clarity Act will be a turning point as it aims to clear rules that will bring more confidence to banks, pension funds, and large investors, which often translates into higher demand and stronger price momentum for BTC. As the regulatory clouds lift, the market might start experiencing a renewed wave of institutional money flowing in, and that’s obviously bullish for BTC.

    "title": "XRP Will Skyrocket Beyond $18: Analyst Suggests 800% Growth Potential In 2026",
    "body": "Market expert Bird has recently issued a bold forecast for XRP, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, suggesting that it could experience a major upside of 800% within this year. If this prediction holds true, XRP could reach a new all-time high of $18.40 per coin. Forecast Indicates XRP Might Rival Ethereum Bird’s forecast hinges on the XRP/BTC ratio, which he predicts will reach 1:5,000 by the end of 2026. This means that 5,000 XRP would be equivalent to 1 Bitcoin (BTC). Currently, the XRP/BTC ratio trades at approximately 0.00002235. Related Reading: Crypto Market Bill Draft Criticized For Allowing Continued Developer Prosecution For Bird’s envisioned target to materialize, the ratio must increase to 0.0002 BTC per token, representing a substantial gain of around 794% from current levels. With a total supply of 100 billion coins, this price projection implies an overall valuation of approximately $1.84 trillion for XRP. Such a figure would place the cryptocurrency in close competition with Ethereum—and striking distance of Bitcoin’s market cap. Additional Price Scenarios For The Altcoin Market expert Sam Daodu also outlined alternative scenarios for XRP’s future performance. In a base case, where the altcoin garners continued institutional support but doesn’t close the gap with Bitcoin’s market capitalization, the price could range between $3 and $4. This outcome would depend on exchange traded funds (ETFs) attracting a “few billion in assets” while Bitcoin’s dominance falls to the 40–50% range during a broader altcoin rotation. Related Reading: Zcash Foundation Investigation Closed: SEC Decision Sparks 12% Jump In ZEC Price Conversely, there exists a bear case where macroeconomic challenges or obstacles within the crypto ecosystem could hinder XRP’s price growth. Factors such as geopolitical instability could redirect capital back to Bitcoin and gold, while banks might opt for private ledgers and established stablecoins instead of adopting XRP. Monthly escrow releases from Ripple of 1 billion coins, accompanied by a potential diminishing exchange-traded fund demand, might cap any potential upside action for the cryptocurrency, leaving it to trade around its current trading prices of $2.

    "title": "Ethereum Chart Turns Bullish: New Cycle Energy Points To $5,000",
    "body": "Ethereum is back to trading just above $3,300 per ETH in a slow bullish extension over the past week. After months of wide swings and failed follow-throughs above $3,000, the structure on the monthly timeframe chart is beginning to look bullish in a way that traders should take seriously. A recent technical breakdown shared by Merlijn The Trader on X shows that Ethereum is approaching a moment where consolidation could give way to forceful expansion, with $5,000 as the most important inflection point. Bullish Pennant Says Bullish Momentum About To Be Unlocked The chart showing the technical analysis from Merlijn shows a bullish pennant forming on Ethereum’s monthly timeframe. This bullish pennant shows that price action has been compressing between a rising support line and a descending resistance line, and this has created a narrowing structure since 2021. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Are Surging Today Ethereum briefly pushed above the upper boundary of this pennant in 2025, rallying to just under the $5,000 mark before momentum faded and corrective moves followed. Since then, price action appears to be gravitating back toward the former resistance line, now acting as a key area of interest. As it stands, Ethereum is now retesting the upper trendline of this bullish pennant for a final upward move. Based on this projection, the first major barrier for Ethereum to break is around $3,300. A clean break above that level would likely open a path toward $3,600, an area that previously acted as a turning point during past rallies. The most consequential zone, however, is around the August 2025 all-time high of $5,000. A break above this zone would unlock bullish momentum based on the bullish pennant and play out in the majority of 2026. How Can This Breakout Play Out? Merlijn’s chart doesn’t stop at the breakout trigger once it breaks above the upper trendline of the pennant. It sketches a full road map for how the move could unfold once Ethereum leaves the pennant. The first step in that projection is a push above $3,600 before a more meaningful test around $5,000. Once Ethereum is able to break above $5,000, then the door is open for new price highs. Related Reading: Why The Ethereum Price Could Bounce Above $3,500 Soon However, the breakout is expected to come with volatility and retests, not a straight line upward, but still resolves higher if the pennant thesis holds. From $5,000, the projection turns into a two-stage expansion. The first stage shows a force move, where Ethereum goes on a rally to as high as $6,000, then chops through another sharp dip to $4,000 and another recovery sequence before the larger leg higher. The larger leg, higher projected on the chart, points to $8,400 as the final price target zone for Ethereum. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Breaks Free From The Current Range — $107,000 Now The Level To Watch",
    "body": "Bitcoin is starting to emerge from its consolidation phase, suggesting that a decisive move may be underway. After holding above the former resistance, the market is starting to show early signs of confidence returning. The spotlight now shifts to the $107,000 level, where the strength of this breakout will be truly tested. Holds Firm Despite A Weak Start To The Session Bitcoin Meraklsi, in a recent BTC market update, outlined a largely positive outlook despite the day beginning with some downside pressure. While early trading showed red across the board, the analyst emphasized that the broader structure remains healthy, with Bitcoin still trading comfortably above the $96,000 region. Related Reading: BTC Breaks Higher as Record Bitcoin ETF Inflows Trigger Wave of Bearish Liquidations A major technical development highlighted in the update is Bitcoin’s breakout above the long-watched $94,800 resistance level, which previously capped upside moves, and is now acting as support. So far, price action suggests that buyers are stepping in on pullbacks, reinforcing the strength of this level and reducing the risk of an immediate reversal. As long as BTC continues to hold above $94,800, the bullish roadmap remains unchanged. The next clear upside target sits at $107,300, a level that could mark the next phase of expansion if momentum continues to build. The analyst also addressed why altcoins have yet to respond meaningfully to Bitcoin’s strength. In the view, the wider market is still waiting for confirmation and confidence from BTC itself. That confidence is more likely to emerge once Bitcoin reaches the $107,300 region. At that point, improved sentiment and risk appetite could spill over into altcoins, setting the stage for a stronger, more synchronized market move. Bitcoin Tests The Upper Boundary Of A Long-Standing Range According to Crypto Candy, Bitcoin appears to be transitioning out of a prolonged consolidation phase after spending considerable time moving sideways. At the time of the post, price was challenging the upper boundary of the $94,000–$96,000 range, signaling a potential shift in market momentum as buyers attempt to regain control. Related Reading: Wall Street Analyst Is Still Bullish On Bitcoin, Predicts Price Recovery BTC is now trading above it, but it must continue to hold above the range, which serves as a crucial validation zone. Sustained strength above this area would confirm bullish intent and increase the probability of a continued advance, with the $107,000 region standing out as the next major upside objective in the weeks ahead. However, the setup is not without risk. If Bitcoin fails to maintain its position above $94,000, the current move could quickly lose traction and be labeled a false breakout. Such a development invites renewed selling pressure, potentially dragging the price back toward lower support zones as the market reassesses direction.

    "body": "Zcash (ZEC) is back on investors’ radar after U.S. regulators ended a long-running investigation into the Zcash Foundation without enforcement. The decision removes a key source of uncertainty that had followed the privacy-focused cryptocurrency since 2023. Related Reading: XRP Price Is Approaching A Key Decision Zone, But Structure Is Still Firmly Bullish Markets reacted quickly, with ZEC posting double-digit gains in some sessions and stabilizing above the $400 level. While regulatory clarity has helped improve sentiment, questions around governance and long-term development remain. ZEC's price trends sideways after a violent move upwards on the daily chart. Source: ZECUSD on Tradingview SEC Closes Two-Year Zcash Investigation The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission confirmed it has concluded its review of the Zcash Foundation, which began with a subpoena issued on August 31, 2023. The inquiry focused on potential securities law concerns tied to Zcash’s funding model, governance structure, and token distribution. According to the foundation, the SEC does not intend to recommend enforcement action, fines, or operational changes. This outcome marks a notable shift for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, which have often faced heightened regulatory scrutiny due to concerns about illicit use. The decision suggests that Zcash’s privacy features alone were not deemed sufficient grounds for action under existing securities laws. The closure also aligns with a broader trend of the SEC withdrawing from several high-profile crypto investigations in recent months under new leadership. For Zcash, the end of the probe removes a regulatory overhang that had weighed on investor confidence for nearly two years. Market Reaction and Price Projections Following the announcement, ZEC surged between 5% and 14% across major exchanges, briefly testing the $440–$450 resistance zone. Currently, the token is trading around $427–$442, holding above the $400 psychological support level. Technically, ZEC remains in a consolidation phase after falling from its January high near $535. Resistance is clustered around $450–$470, while support sits near $400, with a deeper floor around $350 if sentiment weakens. Some analysts point to a symmetrical triangle pattern on longer timeframes, often viewed as a continuation structure after strong rallies. A confirmed breakout above the upper trendline could open the door toward higher levels, including a potential retest of the $1,000 mark later in 2026. Governance Uncertainty Clouds the Outlook Despite the regulatory win, internal challenges persist. Earlier this month, the full development team at Electric Coin Company (ECC), which has led core Zcash development, resigned following a dispute with its nonprofit board. Former ECC leaders cited deteriorating working conditions and have since announced plans to launch a new privacy-focused wallet, cashZ, based on Zcash technology. Related Reading: Arthur Hayes Bets On MSTR, Metaplanet And Zcash As Bitcoin Liquidity Turns The Zcash Foundation has stated that network operations and protocol stability remain unaffected by the personnel changes.

    "body": "Sui’s blockchain resumed normal activity after a network stall that halted transactions for roughly six hours on January 14, 2026. According to reports, validators identified the problem in the mid-afternoon and worked to roll out a fix that restored block creation and transaction processing later that evening. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New Power Buyers: Companies Bought 3 Times What Miners Produced Outage Timeline And Recovery Based on reports, Sui’s team first flagged the issue at about 2:52 pm UTC when block production and checkpoint creation stopped. Validators applied changes and began bringing nodes back into sync. Service was reported as restored at about 8:44 pm UTC, a span of roughly five hours and 52 minutes from detection to recovery. During that interval, no new blocks were finalized and user activity stopped across wallets and decentralized apps. The Sui network is now back and fully operational. Transactions are flowing normally. If you are still seeing issues, please refresh your app or browser window. Thanks for your patience. We will share a full incident review in the coming days. Please check… — Sui (@SuiNetwork) January 14, 2026 Transactions Halted And Value Frozen The halt left a large amount of on-chain value inactive while the network was stalled. Reports indicate more than $1 billion in value was effectively frozen during the outage, though there were no signs of funds being stolen or altered. Users and apps that rely on the chain saw failed or queued transactions, and many dApps displayed errors until validators finished their updates. Cause, Response And Market Reaction Reports have disclosed that the problem was recorded as a consensus outage, meaning the mechanism used to agree on new blocks stopped finalizing. A full technical root-cause writeup has not yet been published. The Sui Foundation said an incident report will appear later with more detail. The SUI token showed modest movement during the event, trading around $1.80–$1.85 in the hours after the network came back, with a brief spike recorded on some exchanges as the news circulated. Past Interruptions And Context Sui launched mainnet in May 2023, and this outage follows previous incidents that raised similar questions about validator coordination and uptime. One earlier major disruption occurred in November 2024, which also involved issues around consensus and validator operation. Developers who build on Sui said many of their services experienced interrupted user flows while the chain was stalled. Related Reading: Russia Drafts Bill That Could Change Who Can Buy Crypto Questions About Network Reliability Some community members and outside observers have asked how often such consensus stalls can happen and what measures will reduce future occurrences. Validators and the Sui team said they were focused on patching the immediate bug and improving monitoring so problems are detected faster. Based on reports, the foundation plans to share specific steps for validators and node operators in the upcoming post-mortem. Sui’s team has said transactions are flowing again and advised users to refresh wallets or apps if they still see problems. The network’s operators have promised more transparency with a formal incident report, which will be watched closely by developers, exchanges, and investors who depend on the chain’s steady operation.

    "body": "Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has revealed that the Dogecoin price is following a bullish signal, which could lead to a rally above the $0.15 level. This comes as the crypto market rebounds, with Bitcoin rallying to a new yearly above $97,000. Dogecoin Price Eyes Rally Above $0.15 With This Bullish Signal In an X post, Trader Tardigrade hinted that the Dogecoin price could rally above $0.15 after rebounding from the Kumo support, which was exactly what the bullish signal flagged. The rebound comes amid the broader crypto market rally, with major crypto assets also recording significant gains as Bitcoin rallies above $97,000, with the psychological $100,000 level now in sight. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rapid Accumulation Suggests Sharp Upward Sweep Is Coming In another X post, Trader Tardigrade revealed that the Dogecoin price has formed a bull flag on the weekly chart and is now targeting the $0.195 price level. This will bring the leading meme coin close to the psychological $0.2 level, with a break above it paving the way for new local highs. Crypto analyst Crypto Tony highlighted the $0.154 level as being critical for the next leg up for the Dogecoin price. His accompanying chart showed that reclaiming this level would spark a rally above $0.16. One factor that could contribute to this bullish run for the foremost meme coin is renewed inflows into the Dogecoin ETFs. SoSoValue data shows that these Dogecoin ETFs still recorded zero flows on January 14 despite the rebound in the Dogecoin price. However, this could change soon, as these funds notably saw increased demand at the start of the year, when DOGE rallied to as high as $0.15, making it one of the best-performing crypto assets among the top 10 coins by market cap. What’s Next For DOGE As It Targets New Highs In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that a successful retest followed by a new local high will be further evidence that the corrective phase for the Dogecoin price has ended. This came as he noted that DOGE, like BTC and many other altcoins, has since come back and successfully tested its key 4-hour MAs after breaking out of them, attempting to end its major corrective phase. The analyst added that a new high would be a break of $0.157. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Are Surging Today Meanwhile, crypto analyst Bitcoinsensus has suggested that the Dogecoin price could rally to as high as $4.5 if DOGE is repeating its macro cycle pattern. The analyst noted that so far this cycle, the meme coin has maintained its ground and has mainly been moving sideways. As such, it remains to be seen if this cycle can be as explosive as the last ones. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.143, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Rally Accompanied By ‘Very Bullish’ Whale-Retail Behavior, Santiment Says",
    "body": "On-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed how Bitcoin is currently in a bullish zone based on the behavior of whale and retail investors. Bitcoin Major & Retail Entities Have Shown Opposite Trajectories Recently In a new post on X, Santiment has talked about how Bitcoin investor behavior currently compares between the top and low ends. Sharks and whales make up for the former category, while retail investors represent the latter. Formally, the wallet ranges of the two sides of the market are defined as 10 to 10,000 BTC and less than 0.01 BTC. Below is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Bitcoin supply held by each of these cohorts over the last few months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Turns ‘Neutral’ For First Time Since October As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin sharks and whales have seen their combined supply rise during the last few days, indicating that the large investors have been accumulating. Meanwhile, the retail investors have sold instead. This could imply that the big-money hands are backing the latest price rally, while small holders don’t believe the run will last, so they are exiting with their profits. If history is to go by, this may actually be a positive signal. According to the analytics firm, whale and retail behavior diverging in this manner puts the market in what it defines as the “Very Bullish” zone. “This is the ideal setup for a bull run,” noted Santiment. In the chart, the analytics firm has also highlighted four other zones for BTC based on the trajectories followed by the whale and retail supplies. “Very Bearish” (colored in red) follows the same contrarian logic as the Very Bullish region, with the zone appearing when large entities are selling, and retail is accumulating. Bearish (orange), Neutral (yellow), and Bullish (blue) map out the spectrum between the two extreme regions. Bitcoin’s latest venture into the green Very Bullish zone has come as sharks and whales have loaded up on 32,693 BTC (worth about $3.1 billion) since January 10th, corresponding to a supply increase of 0.24%. Retail investors have sold 149 BTC ($14.4 million) in this window instead, equivalent to a drop of 0.30%. Related Reading: Litecoin Whale Activity Spikes To 5-Week High: Reversal Or Continuation Signal? It now remains to be seen whether BTC will stay in this region for long or if another shift in investor behavior will take place. “How long it lasts depends on how long retail doubts the mini rally that has formed,” explains Santiment. BTC Price Bitcoin witnessed a break beyond the $97,000 level on Wednesday, but the bullish momentum has since cooled, with the BTC price returning to the $96,900 mark.

    "body": "Keyrock and Dune have published a “12 Charts to Watch in 2026” dashboard that tries to pin next year’s crypto narrative to measurable market structure, where liquidity is forming, where value is being returned, and which rails are quietly becoming systemically important. The report’s premise is straightforward: each chart pairs a live dataset with an explicit 2026 prediction. Taken together, the set reads like a checklist of whether crypto’s core primitives: trading, issuance, payments, and funding are becoming deeper and more institutional in their behavior. 12 Crypto Metrics To Watch This Year Keyrock puts prediction markets near the top of the stack after a 2025 run that saw weekly volume rise 9.2x to just under $5 billion, with Kalshi, Polymarket and Opinion controlling a combined 98.4% share at the time of writing. For 2026, it forecasts a 5x jump versus the 2025 run-rate to $25 billion in weekly volume, and a matching 5x rise in open interest as markets deepen and positions persist longer. Related Reading: Crypto Market Bill Draft Criticized For Allowing Continued Developer Prosecution On tokenization, the chart tracks non-stablecoin onchain RWA AUM, explicitly excluding stablecoins to isolate whether capital markets assets are moving onchain. Keyrock says non-stablecoin RWA AUM grew 3.4x in 2025 and projects more than 4x growth in 2026, led by tokenized cash-like products (T-bills and money market funds) and private credit, with early signs of equities and ETFs as market structure and regulation mature. A third adoption vector is x402, which Keyrock describes as an open payments protocol pioneered by Coinbase in 2025 to let software, including AI agents pay for digital services using stablecoins. Its measurable call: weekly x402 volume exceeding $100 million in 2026, framed as a proxy for “machine-native commerce” showing up in production. For onchain asset management, Keyrock tracks vault AUM across major providers and argues 2025 was about product maturity; 2026 is positioned as distribution. Its headline forecast is vault AUM tripling to $36 billion before year-end, alongside a prediction that at least one major broker-dealer offers an onchain vault “yield shelf.” Related Reading: New Hope For Crypto: Senators Introduce Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act Derivatives are treated as the clearest stress test for depth. Keyrock highlights how the DEX-to-CEX futures trading ratio grew more than 3x in 2025, from 6.34% to 21%, and says open interest—not volume—is the key signal for whether venues can “hold risk in size” as new asset classes migrate onchain. The 2026 target: onchain perp OI exceeding $50 billion. Value return is monitored via buybacks. The report notes multi-million-dollar programs in 2025 from Hyperliquid, Raydium and Pump.fun, and predicts weekly buyback spend reaches at least 2x 2025 levels, plus a shift away from “fixed percentage of fees” models toward “value-aware” execution (pacing bands, triggers, disciplined accumulation). Solana MEV is framed as a distribution problem as much as a trading one. Keyrock notes tip-based MEV (validator + Jito tips) fell from a peak of 100,000 SOL (about $25 million at the time) to a low of 1,000 SOL (about $139,000), then points to the Block Assembly Marketplace (BAM) as the mechanism that could reshape where MEV is captured, away from reflexive tip spikes and toward explicit execution pricing set by apps and venues. Moreover, Keyrock uses “shielded ZEC” as a privacy proxy and forecasts shielded deposits rising from 4.9 million to more than 7 million by end-2026. On Ethereum, it tracks whether blobs develop a meaningful fee floor and predicts a median hourly blob cost of at least $0.05 per blob on a full-year basis. Payments show up in consumer form via crypto card spend, with the report forecasting a $500 million monthly spend print at least once in 2026. TradFi integration is tracked via spot BTC ETF AUM, with Keyrock projecting holdings surpass 2.5 million BTC in 2026 and net inflows positive in at least eight months. Finally, the stablecoin funding chart anchors on Aave’s USDC variable borrow APY on Ethereum, which it says ranged from 2.4% to 9.8% in 2025. The forward-looking claim is about rate stability rather than level: a drop in 30-day rolling volatility of USDC borrow APY to an average below 0.25 versus roughly 0.40 in 2025—positioned as a prerequisite for longer-duration, institution-style strategies. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.25 trillion. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Bull Score Hits Level Seen Only 7 Times In 6 Years – A Rare Historical Signal",
    "body": "Bitcoin has shown renewed bullish momentum in recent sessions, pushing price back toward the $97,000 level after weeks of persistent selling pressure. For much of the recent consolidation, the market struggled under distribution from short-term participants and cautious positioning from traders who remained uncertain about the broader trend. That dynamic now appears to be shifting. While price action alone does not confirm a full trend reversal, the latest rebound suggests that downside pressure is easing and that buyers are becoming more willing to absorb available supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Take Control: Futures Positioning Turns Bullish for First Time Since October This improvement in price behavior is supported by on-chain context rather than pure speculation. A quick insight from a CryptoQuant analyst highlights a rare development in market sentiment: the Bitcoin Bull Score Index has dropped to 20, a level that has historically appeared only a handful of times over the past several years. Such readings typically reflect deeply pessimistic conditions, when bullish signals across multiple indicators are scarce. Paradoxically, these environments often coincide with transitional phases rather than sustained declines. When bearish sentiment becomes widespread and measurable optimism disappears, markets tend to become increasingly sensitive to even modest improvements in demand. Bitcoin Bull Score Hits A Rare Historical Level Over the past six years, the Bitcoin Bull Score Index has fallen to levels of 20 or lower only seven times. The market is now experiencing the seventh occurrence, placing the current environment among the rarest sentiment regimes in Bitcoin’s history. This index aggregates multiple on-chain and market indicators to assess whether conditions favor bullish continuation or reflect broad-based weakness. Readings near 20 indicate that very few bullish signals are active at the same time, highlighting a market dominated by caution rather than optimism. Historically, such extremes have tended to appear during transitional phases. They often emerge late in corrections, when selling pressure has largely played out, but confidence has not yet returned. This does not guarantee an immediate reversal. However, it does suggest that downside momentum is becoming increasingly fragile, as most participants who wanted to de-risk have already done so. The timing of this signal is particularly relevant as Bitcoin approaches a critical psychological zone near $100,000. This level represents both a major round-number resistance and a key reference point for short-term and long-term holders. The coming weeks will be decisive. A sustained push toward and above $100K, accompanied by improving breadth in on-chain indicators, would likely mark a shift away from defensive positioning. Conversely, failure at this level could reinforce consolidation and prolong uncertainty. Related Reading: OG Bitcoin Selling Slows Sharply: Long-Dormant Coins Go Quiet Weekly Chart Shows Recovery Attempt Below Resistance Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a market attempting to reassert strength after a prolonged corrective phase, with price now trading around the $96,000–$97,000 zone. This area is technically important, as it aligns with a former consolidation range that acted as support during mid-2025 and later flipped into resistance after the November breakdown. The recent rebound suggests buyers are willing to defend higher lows, but confirmation remains incomplete. From a trend perspective, Bitcoin is still trading below the declining 50-week moving average, which currently caps upside attempts. This level has acted as dynamic resistance during previous bear-to-neutral transitions. And will be a critical area to reclaim for trend continuation. Below the price, the 100-week moving average continues to slope upward and has provided structural support during the recent pullbacks. Reinforcing the idea that the broader market structure remains intact despite short-term weakness. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Near A Profit Flip: A Key Level Comes Into Focus Volume behavior is also notable. The rebound toward $97,000 occurred without a major expansion in volume, revealing that the move may still lack strong conviction. This supports the view that the current advance could be a recovery leg within a larger consolidation rather than the start of an impulse. If Bitcoin can consolidate above $95,000 and eventually reclaim the 50-week moving average, the probability of a continuation toward the $105,000–$110,000 region increases. Failure to hold this zone would expose the market to renewed downside tests toward the mid-$80,000s. Keeping the broader consolidation unresolved.

XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.120 zone. The price is now trading below $2.10 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.0850 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it stays below $2.10. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price failed to stay above $2.150 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below $2.120 and $2.10 to enter a short-term bearish zone. The price even spiked below $2.080. A low was formed at $2.052, and the price is now consolidating losses. There was an attempt to clear $2.080 and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.193 swing high to the $2.052 low, but the bears remained active. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.0850 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.10 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.0850 level and the trend line. The first major resistance is near the $2.120 level. It is close to 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.193 swing high to the $2.052 low. A close above $2.120 could send the price to $2.1395. The next hurdle sits at $2.20. A clear move above the $2.20 resistance might send the price toward the $2.250 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.320 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.350. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.120 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.050 level. The next major support is near the $2.020 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.020 level, the price might continue to decline toward $1.950. The next major support sits near the $1.920 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.880.

    "body": "According to ValidatorQueue data, staked Ethereum has climbed to close to 36 million, equal to nearly 30% of the circulating supply. That figure now represents more than $119 billion at current prices. Staking rose from 35.5 million to almost 36 million since early January, even though ETH has fallen more than 30% since August. Related Reading: Futures Frenzy Pushed Crypto Exchange Volume To Nearly $80 Trillion In 2025 The unstaking queue is zero, while the staking queue topped 2.5 million ETH — its highest level since August 2023. Based on reports, those moves point to strong long-term bets on the network. Ethereum Staking Shows Strong Conviction Institutional interest helped push the numbers higher. Publicly listed Digital Asset Treasuries and big staking services are said to be among the active participants. Some of the latest increases came during a stretch that had been mostly flat since last August. Market watchers say that rising stakes add to the protocol’s security profile, and the large queue suggests demand for on-chain commitments remains high even with price weakness. Buterin Says Infrastructure Is Ready Meanwhile, reports have disclosed that Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin, has urged builders to stop experimenting only in theory and start shipping real products. He has argued that the technical pieces are finally functional: the chain runs on proof of stake, transaction costs are lower, and scaling through ZK-EVMs and Layer 2s is working. Messaging that began with Whisper has been adapted into Waku, and apps such as Status and Railway were cited as examples that already use these systems. In 2014, there was a vision: you can have permissionless, decentralized applications that could support finance, social media, ride sharing, governing organizations, crowdfunding, potentially create an entire alternative web, all on the backs of a suite of technologies.… pic.twitter.com/ihU9qOrXfG — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 14, 2026 He used the term “walkaway test” to describe a simple check: if a decentralized app’s operator disappears, can the data and functionality remain available to users? Fileverse, a decentralized document editor, was pointed to as a case where documents would survive even if the team behind it vanished. Builders Urged To Ship Practical Apps Buterin also criticized the trend toward overly centralized consumer devices and services that lock users into accounts and subscriptions. He warned against appliances that require registration and that may collect data on routine tasks. He contrasted those products with tools that a person truly owns and controls. The message was clear: now that infrastructure is in place, developers should focus on practical software people will actually use, not just experiments that live on testnets. What This Means Going Forward The split between the technical optimism and the market reality is visible. On one side, nearly 36 million ETH staked and a swollen staking queue show investor conviction in the protocol’s future. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New Power Buyers: Companies Bought 3 Times What Miners Produced On the other, price pressure since August has been real and is still being felt. Reports emphasize that the climb in staked ETH strengthens the network’s security, but the call to build usable, user-friendly apps remains loud. If developers respond by shipping useful products that meet everyday needs, the combination of a secure chain and working applications could push broader adoption. For now, the numbers and the rhetoric are both sending a clear signal: the ingredients exist, and attention is shifting toward turning them into tools people rely on.

    "body": "Leading derivatives exchange CME plans to add futures contracts tied to Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), and Stellar (XLM) to continue growing its roster of regulated crypto derivatives. Related Reading: Analyst Says It’s Time For Ethereum’s ‘Big Test’ – Is ETH Season Loading? CME Adds New Altcoins To Crypto Derivatives Lineup On Thursday, Chicago-based derivatives exchange CME Group announced a new expansion of its lineup of regulated crypto derivatives with the upcoming inclusion of Cardano, Chainlink, and Stellar futures. According to the announcement, the new crypto additions are expected to launch on February 9, 2026, although they are still pending regulatory review. In addition, they will offer both micro-sized and larger-sized contracts for the three cryptocurrencies. For the standard Cardano futures, the contract will cover 100,000 ADA, while the micro-sized ADA futures will consist of 10,000 tokens. In addition, the Chainlink and Stellar’s large-sized futures will be set at 5,000 LINK and 250,000 XLM, respectively, while the small-sized contracts will cover 250 LINK and 12,500 XLM. The upcoming Cardano, Chainlink, and Stellar futures contracts build on the derivatives exchange’s existing crypto suite, which includes four of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. In 2017, CME first launched Bitcoin (BTC) futures, followed by the introduction of Ethereum (ETH) futures in 2021. In the first half of 2025, the Chicago-based exchange added Solana (SOL) and XRP futures to its lineup, introducing options for both cryptocurrencies later in the year. Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products, highlighted the industry’s expansion and development over the past few years, affirming that “given crypto’s record growth over the last year, clients are looking for trusted, regulated products to manage price risk as well as additional tools to gain exposure to this dynamic market.” “With these new micro- and larger-size Cardano, Chainlink and Stellar futures contracts, market participants will now have greater choice with enhanced flexibility and more capital-efficiencies,” he added. Cardano, Chainlink, Stellar Price Reaction Despite the positive development, the trajectory of ADA, LINK, and XLM remained mostly unchanged, with the three altcoins continuing their intraday correction. Chainlink and Stellar both saw 4% declines from their Thursday highs, falling to the $13.60 and $0.225 levels. LINK has momentarily lost the $13.80 level as support and is attempting to hold the current area to prevent further bleeding. Similarly, XLM was also rejected from the Wednesday highs and bounced from the $0.230 before continuing its descent toward its two-day low.

Meanwhile, ADA was attempting to reclaim the $0.41 area ahead of the announcement, briefly bouncing from the recent pullback. Notably, Cardano surged over 10% from the recent lows toward the crucial $0.42-$0.43 area. However, the altcoin was rejected from this zone on Wednesday, retracing nearly 9% from the local highs to retest the $0.40 level. On Thursday morning, the cryptocurrency bounced from this area, but ultimately resumed its correction as the day progressed. As a result, Cardano has retraced most of this week’s gains, currently trading around the $0.391 mark. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Altcoin Rallies Are Getting Shorter, And Wintermute Has The Data",
    "body": "According to Wintermute’s 2025 Digital Asset OTC Markets report, altcoin rallies last year were much shorter than traders expected, averaging about 19–20 days. That is a steep drop from the roughly 60-day runs seen in 2024. Market flows tightened, and many smaller tokens saw gains vanish faster than before. The result: capital moved back into the big names — Bitcoin and Ethereum — where liquidity is deeper. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New Power Buyers: Companies Bought 3 Times What Miners Produced Altcoin Open Interest Drops Based on reports, one key trigger was a sharp deleveraging on October 10, 2025, which pushed retail traders to reduce risk and rotate out of smaller tokens. Open interest in many altcoin futures contracts fell, with some coverage noting about a 55% decline in altcoin futures open interest since October. Trading desks said lower liquidity made it harder for rallies to keep going beyond a few weeks, turning what used to be multi-month moves into short bursts. Major Coins Reclaimed Center Stage Institutional flows and product structures played a role. Reports have disclosed that ETFs and other institutional channels helped funnel funds toward Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a result, the market’s attention narrowed. Where narratives once pushed dozens of tokens into rallies, more capital was now concentrated in the top tier. Traders say they preferred assets where orders could be filled without dramatically moving the price. Short, Intense Moves Replaced Long Trends Wintermute’s analysis points to a change in how momentum forms. Rally drivers became more tactical and less about broad, lasting narratives. In practice, that meant memecoin pumps and exchange-themed rallies burned out quickly. Some traders described these moves as hair-trigger events: quick upswings followed by equally rapid retracements. Liquidity bands tightened and stops were hit sooner than in past cycles. What Traders And Firms Are Watching Market participants say the path to a sustained altcoin season now requires a few things aligning. Reports indicate renewed retail interest, clearer institutional support for smaller tokens, and calmer macro markets could help. Otherwise, rallies are likely to remain short. Execution desks reported that when big buyers reappeared for a token, it could run fast, but keeping that momentum proved difficult without deeper market participation. Related Reading: Futures Frenzy Pushed Crypto Exchange Volume To Nearly $80 Trillion In 2025 Outlook For 2026 Based on the report and market commentary, a broader crypto rebound in 2026 depends on several moving parts: interest from institutions, shifts in macro rates, and retail returning to risk-on strategies. If those elements arrive, rallies might last longer than the 19–20 day average seen in 2025. If not, traders say the pattern of quick, sharp moves into the majors will continue.

    "title": "Bitcoin Tailwind: Cathie Wood Sees ‘Reaganomics On Steroids’ Ahead",
    "body": "Cathie Wood is arguing that the next phase of US policy and macro could recreate an early-1980s style risk-on regime, one that, in her telling, strengthens the case for bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier even as it complicates the “digital gold” narrative. In a post on X, the ARK Invest CEO said “the next three years could be Reaganomics on steroids,” pointing to deregulation, tax cuts, “sound monetary policy,” and “peace through strength” as ingredients for a stronger dollar and capped gold prices. Her January 15 “New Year letter,” titled Cathie Wood’s 2026 Outlook: The US Economy Is A Coiled Spring, lays out the mechanics behind that analogy and places crypto explicitly inside the policy and productivity story. A “Coiled Spring” Macro Thesis Wood’s central claim is that the US has looked sturdier than it really is because weakness has rotated through rate-sensitive pockets rather than hitting the whole economy at once. “Despite sustained real gross domestic product (GDP) growth during the past three years, the underlying US economy has suffered a rolling recession and has evolved into a coiled spring that could bounce back powerfully during the next few years. In response to COVID-related supply shocks, the record-breaking 22-fold surge in the Fed funds rate from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.5% in the sixteen months ended July 2023 pushed housing, manufacturing, non-AI capital spending, and low-to-middle income America into recession.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Accompanied By ‘Very Bullish’ Whale-Retail Behavior, Santiment Says She anchors the housing leg with a specific trough: existing home sales fell 40% from a 5.9 million annual rate in January 2021 to 3.5 million in October 2023, which she notes is “a level last seen in November 2010.” From there, Wood pivots to policy impulse and cash-flow relief. “Thanks to the confluence of deregulation and lower taxes (including tariffs), inflation, and interest rates, the rolling recession which has characterized the last few years in the US could turn quickly and sharply during the next year and beyond. Deregulation is unleashing innovation in every sector, led by the first AI and Crypto Czar, David Sacks, in the AI and digital assets space. Meanwhile, lower taxes on tips, overtime, and social security should hand US consumers significant refunds this quarter, potentially driving real disposable income growth up from ~2% at an annual rate during the second half of 2025 to ~8.3% this quarter.” She also argues corporate cash flows could be boosted by accelerated depreciation, writing that it could push the effective corporate tax rate “down toward 10%,” with 100% first-year depreciation for equipment, software and domestic R&D made permanent and retroactive to January 1, 2025. Gold, Bitcoin, And The Dollar Wood’s inflation case is concrete and component-driven. She points to oil falling from about $124 on March 8, 2022 to a level that’s roughly 53% lower, and down about 22% year-over-year as of ARK’s January 12 data cut. She adds that single-family home sale prices are down about 15% from the October 2022 peak, while existing home price inflation (three-month moving average) decelerated from roughly 24% YoY in June 2021 to about 1.3%. On labor, she cites non-farm productivity up 1.9% YoY (third quarter), compensation per man-hour up 3.2%, and unit labor cost inflation at 1.2%. She then pushes a real-time check: Truflation at 1.7% YoY as of January 7, nearly 100 bps below CPI-based inflation. The crypto hook comes through her attempt to split gold’s recent run from bitcoin’s role in portfolios. “During 2025, the gold price appreciated 65% as the price of bitcoin slipped 6%. While many observers have attributed the 166% surge in the gold price from $1,600 to $4,300 since the end of the US equity bear market in October 2022 to the risk of inflation, another interpretation is that global wealth creation… has outpaced the ~1.8% annualized increase in the gold supply globally.” Related Reading: Glassnode: Bitcoin Is Back At $96K, Hitting The Same Sell Ceiling Again Wood then leans on supply schedules and correlations. She notes bitcoin’s supply is “mathematically metered” to rise about 0.82% per year for the next two years before slowing to ~0.41%, and argues that diversification — not “digital gold” rhetoric — is the cleaner allocator lens. In ARK’s correlation matrix using weekly returns from 1/1/2020 through 1/6/2026, bitcoin’s correlation is 0.14 to gold, 0.06 to bonds, and 0.28 to the S&P 500; the S&P 500–bonds correlation is shown at 0.27. Finally, she brings it back to FX: after a year in which the trade-weighted dollar (DXY) fell 11% in the first half and 9% for the full year, Wood argues that higher US returns on invested capital, driven by fiscal, deregulation, and US-led technological breakthroughs, could push the dollar higher, echoing the early Reagan period when “the dollar nearly doubled.” If Wood’s “Reaganomics on steroids” framing gains traction, the near-term market implication is less about a single bitcoin price target and more about positioning: a regime she expects to feature falling inflation, lower rates, and heavy AI capex (data-center systems investment up 47% to nearly $500 billion in 2025, with a further 20% to roughly $600 billion expected in 2026) is one where allocators may revisit where bitcoin sits on the risk spectrum, and whether its low cross-asset correlation is the more durable thesis than any one-line comparison to gold. While Wood’s 2026 outlook does not publish a specific Bitcoin price target, ARK has previously outlined 2030 scenarios for BTC of roughly $300,000 (bear), $710,000 (base), and $1.2 million (bull). At press time, BTC traded at $95,685. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Ethereum On Fire: User Growth Sparks Massive Activity Spike",
    "body": "Ethereum’s on-chain activity has jumped sharply, driven by a wave of first-time users and heavier transaction flow across the network. According to Glassnode, new activity retention roughly doubled this month — rising from about 4 million to around 8 million addresses — a move that points to a fresh cohort of wallets interacting with Ethereum rather than just repeat users. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New Power Buyers: Companies Bought 3 Times What Miners Produced Surge In New Users Daily transactions hit a record high of 2.8 million on Thursday, a figure that is up 125% from the same period last year. Based on reports from Etherscan, active addresses have more than doubled year-over-year, moving from roughly 410,000 accounts to over 1 million as of Jan. 15. Those numbers suggest real, broad-based engagement is increasing, not merely short-lived spikes. Ethereum’s Month-over-Month Activity Retention shows a sharp spike in the “New” cohort, indicating a surge in first-time interacting addresses over the past 30 days. This reflects a notable influx of new wallets engaging with the Ethereum network, rather than activity being… pic.twitter.com/h8Zw7hXOSX — glassnode (@glassnode) January 15, 2026 Transaction Boom And L2 Effects Observers link the transaction growth in part to rising stablecoin activity and lower fees. Reports have disclosed that many transfers are migrating execution to Layer 2 networks while settlement stays on Ethereum’s main chain, which keeps finality secure and helps push down gas costs. Staking has also climbed, reaching nearly 36 million ETH, adding another layer to the network’s tightening supply dynamics. At the same time, market behavior remains careful. Strength in US equities has helped stabilize crypto prices, yet money flowing into Ethereum looks selective rather than broad. It seems that positioning is rather conservative; traders prefer waiting for more accurate signals regarding ETH prices instead of attempting to predict a breakout. In turn, ETH is consolidating around a correction, but there is not enough momentum-driven buying. Analyst Views & Price Movement There were also those who cited optimism based on improvements to on-chain fundamentals. For instance, LVRG Research reported that the increasing number of transactions and staking activities encouraged a positive network. Some traders argue the compression in price action could precede a breakout. Ether traded near a two-month high of $3,400 on Wednesday and was around $3,300 in early trading on Friday, reflecting the tug of war between renewed demand and persistent caution. Despite the stronger metrics, technical hurdles remain. Reports and recent analysis suggest the market is in a repair phase, not a confirmed uptrend. Overhead supply still constrains sustained advances, and many market participants want to see ETH reclaim key long-term resistance levels, such as the 200-day EMA, before committing large-scale capital. That explains why short-term traders operate inside a defined range while longer-term players hold back. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record Levels As Buterin Urges Builders To Deliver Real Apps What This Means For Traders And Investors Network health has improved materially — more users, more transactions, and higher staking — but price action has not yet matched those gains. Based on the data presented, cautious optimism is reasonable. Traders may find chance to trade the range, while investors looking for conviction should wait for cleaner technical confirmation before assuming a sustained rally.

    "title": "Dogecoin Flirts With An Inverse Head And Shoulders: $0.15 Break Is The Trigger",
    "body": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is trying to base on higher timeframes as Cantonese Cat points to a potential inverse head-and-shoulders on the daily, with price compressing just beneath a defined resistance shelf while holding a nearby demand zone. Dogecoin Breakout Could Target $0.19 In a daily chart (DOGE/USD, Binance) shared via X on Jan. 16, Cantonese Cat overlays an inverse head-and-shoulders schematic: a left shoulder in early December, a deeper “head” into late December near the mid-$0.11s, and a developing right shoulder as price rotates lower after the early-January spike. The key feature on that daily view is a highlighted “Buy order block” spanning roughly $0.1250 to $0.1350. Price is shown pulling back toward the top of that block after failing to hold the most recent push higher, which places the current trade location in a classic “right shoulder” area if the pattern is going to remain constructive. Above the current spot price, the chart marks a horizontal grey resistance (“the shoulder”) band at roughly $0.149–$0.152. This is the area DOGE needs to reclaim for the inverse H&S thesis to transition from “forming” to “triggering,” because it has acted as supply on recent tests. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Is Following This Bullish Signal With A Major Target Using Cantonese Cat’s daily inverse head-and-shoulders chart, the measured move is the neckline minus the head low, projected upward from the neckline: the neckline is the grey supply band centered near $0.151 (label on the axis), while the head prints at roughly $0.116. That gives a height of about $0.035, implying a pattern target near $0.186. Notably, that objective runs directly into the chart’s overhead red supply zone, which begins around $0.175 and extends up toward $0.19, making that area the first obvious region where a confirmed breakout would be expected to meet meaningful resistance. DOGE 2-Day Bollinger Bands Signal Momentum Notably, the Bollinger Bands on the 2-day chart support the mid-term bullish thesis. On Tuesday, Cantonese Cat highlighted that DOGE is trading above the Bollinger basis around $0.1343, while the upper band is near $0.1526 and the lower band near $0.1160. Cantonese Cat summarized the idea succinctly: “Price wanting to hang out at the top part of the Bollinger band? We have a chance here?” In practice, the “top part” framing matters because it’s a momentum tell. After an extended decline, sustained closes above the basis and into the upper half of the bands can signal that sellers are no longer controlling the volatility profile, even before price clears the obvious horizontal resistance. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Don’t Celebrate Too Early: This Level Still Must Fall That said, the 2D view also makes the immediate problem clear: the upper band sits close to the same zone highlighted on the daily as resistance. In other words, the bullish thesis is not just “hold support,” but “prove it” with acceptance above the $0.15–$0.152 region. If DOGE continues to defend the $0.1250–$0.1350 buy-side block and reclaims the $0.149–$0.152 supply band, the inverse head-and-shoulders thesis gains credibility. The next areas the chart itself flags are the higher supply zones around $0.175 and the upper-$0.18s region, where prior selling pressure was visible. If price loses the buy order block, the pattern read weakens materially. In that case, the Bollinger structure on the 2D chart points attention back toward the lower band region near $0.1160 and the late-December lows. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.139.
