    "title": "Record Pain: Bitcoin Investors Suffer $4.5B Loss, Most In 3 Years",
    "body": "Reports note that Bitcoin holders realized large losses as prices slid, and the headline number is hard to ignore. According to on-chain tracker CryptoQuant, about $4.5 billion in net losses was recorded on January 23. Related Reading: Bitcoin Influencers Get Spotlight In X’s New ‘Starterpacks’ That number reflects moved coins sold at prices lower than when they were bought. It is a big transfer of paper pain into real losses. Realized Losses Spike While the dollar figure grabs attention, the meaning is what matters. Many who bought late in the run higher are choosing to sell rather than hold through more decline. That behavior shows frustration. Reports say the Net Realized Profit and Loss metric tallies this by comparing sell prices to purchase prices, and a negative reading this large signals a wave of capitulation. Some larger, long-term holders have been quieter. Their activity appears muted while smaller and mid-term participants make the day-to-day moves. According to analyst posts on CryptoQuant, this mix — quiet big holders and active smaller sellers — is common during corrective stretches. It does not automatically mean the market is broken; it means sentiment has shifted toward caution. $4.5 Billion in Realized Loss on Bitcoin “Highest amount of realized losses in three years. The last time this occurred in Bitcoin, the price was trading at $28,000 after a brief correction period that lasted about a year.” – By @gaah_im pic.twitter.com/OJ7bbL3RSC — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 26, 2026 Bitcoin Price Action Midway through the week, Bitcoin traded around the mid-$80,000s, well below the $90,000 mark that some investors had eyed as a key level. Market chatter shows traders watching macro cues like the US Federal Reserve and inflation data for guidance. Volatility has not disappeared; it has simply become more tied to broader economic signals than to isolated crypto headlines. Whale addresses appeared to step in at times, helping to hold local price floors. But many traders remain cautious. Reports note that geopolitical headlines can cause quick swings, yet the current movement looks more like slow digestion of profit and repositioning than explosive panic selling. Activity on spot exchanges and ETF flows has been variable, reflecting the mixed mood across the market. Related Reading: XRP Showing Strength, Analyst Points To $4 Potential Capitulation Has Come Before Similar loss spikes were seen in March 2023, when realized losses reached close to $6 billion, and in November 2022, when losses hit roughly $4.3 billion. These events were followed by consolidation and then eventual recovery. Based on reports from analytics firms and market observers, spikes in realized losses can mark the late stages of selling pressure, after which the market sometimes finds a base.

    "body": "Solana started a recovery wave above the $125 zone. SOL price is now consolidating and faces hurdles near the $128 zone. SOL price started a decent recovery wave above $122 and $125 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $125 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $124 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could continue to move up if it clears $128 and $130. Solana Price Faces Resistance Solana price remained stable and started a decent recovery wave from $118, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL was able to climb above the $122 level. There was a move above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $132 swing high to the $117 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $124 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The bulls even pushed the price above $125. However, the bears remained active near $128. Solana is now trading above $125 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $128 level, and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $132 swing high to the $117 low. The next major resistance is near the $130 level. The main resistance could be $135. A successful close above the $135 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $142. Any more gains might send the price toward the $145 level. Another Decline In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $128 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $124.50 zone. The first major support is near the $122 level. A break below the $122 level might send the price toward the $117 support zone. If there is a close below the $117 support, the price could decline toward the $105 zone in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $125 and $122. Major Resistance Levels – $128 and $130.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Price Braces For FOMC Volatility As History Shows Major Post‑Fed Sell‑Offs",
    "body": "The Bitcoin price is under increasing pressure ahead of Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which has historically corresponded with big price movements in the market’s largest cryptocurrency. Rate Cut Odds Fade The Federal Reserve (Fed) is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged at this meeting. Economists surveyed by financial data provider FactSet anticipate the federal funds rate — the benchmark rate banks use for overnight lending — will remain in the 3.5% to 3.75% range. Such a pause would follow three consecutive rate cuts delivered by the Fed toward the end of last year, a shift that initially fueled optimism across risk assets, including the Bitcoin price. Related Reading: XRP Outlook For 2026: AI Model Signals New Record Ahead — Can Price Reach $6? Despite that earlier momentum, the Bitcoin price has struggled to maintain its footing. Ahead of the FOMC decision, the cryptocurrency is trading near $87,780, roughly 30% below the all‑time highs reached last year. Market analyst Ali Martinez has pointed to Bitcoin’s historical behavior around FOMC meetings as a reason for caution. In a recent post on X (previously Twitter) Martinez highlighted that expectations for a January rate cut are extremely low, estimated at just 2.8%, signaling that meaningful policy easing is unlikely in the near term. That backdrop, he argues, has often set the stage for increased volatility for the Bitcoin price rather than sustained upside. Looking back at 2025, Martinez noted that Bitcoin reacted negatively after the vast majority of the Fed’s policy meetings. Of the eight FOMC decisions held during the year, seven were followed by notable declines for the Bitcoin price. The January meeting was followed by a 27% drop, March saw a 14% decline, June was down 8%, July slipped 6%, September fell 7%, October recorded a 29% pullback, and December ended with a 9% loss. The analysts noted that the only exception seen in the year came in May, when the Bitcoin price briefly rallied about 15% after the decision. Bitcoin Price Approaches Key Decision Zone From a technical and on‑chain perspective, analyst BitBull also sees the Bitcoin price approaching a critical moment. BitBull noted on social media that the asset has entered what she describes as a key on‑chain decision zone. At current levels, the Bitcoin price is trading almost exactly at the Active Investor Mean, estimated near $87,500. This level represents the average cost basis for active buyers, placing much of that capital at breakeven. Related Reading: Tether Reveals Massive Gold Accumulation In Q4: Adds 27 Tons To Reserves BitBull explained that pressure is building on both sides of the price. Above current levels, the short‑term holder cost basis sits near $96,500, meaning many recent buyers are already underwater. As a result, any upward move toward that zone could face selling pressure as traders look to exit at reduced losses. On the downside, the True Market Mean at around $80,700 has historically marked the boundary between a “routine correction and deeper structural weakness.” Further below, the realized price near $56,000 suggests that long‑term holders remain firmly in profit and largely unshaken by recent volatility. BitBull argues if the Bitcoin price can maintain support above the $87,500 level, it would indicate that active capital is defending its position and that broader market strength remains intact. A sustained break below that level, however, could open the door for a move toward $80,700. Featured image from OpenArt, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "A rising share of shops in the US are now taking crypto at checkout. That shift is small in some places and big in others, but it is real. Reports say that roughly four in 10 US merchants accept cryptocurrency today, and customer interest is a clear reason why. Related Reading: Record Pain: Bitcoin Investors Suffer $4.5B Loss, Most In 3 Years Merchant Demand Is Rising According to a new survey from PayPal and the National Cryptocurrency Association, about 39% of merchants have added crypto as a payment option. Many of those firms say they hear from buyers about crypto use on a regular basis. Reports note that 88% of merchants have gotten questions about paying with crypto, and 69% say they see demand at least once a month. Also, 84% of respondents think crypto payments will be common within five years, which shows a lot of business leaders expect wider use soon. Who’s Accepting Crypto Adoption is uneven. Big companies with annual revenue above $500 million lead the pack, with roughly 50% accepting crypto. Smaller shops lag at about 34%, while midsize firms sit near 32%. Travel and hospitality, gaming and digital goods, and higher-end retail are among the sectors pushing crypto forward. These markets often sell online or to tech-savvy buyers, so it makes sense they’d move faster. Crypto’s Role In Sales For merchants that already accept digital assets, crypto is not just an occasional trickle. Reports say digital assets account for over a quarter of sales for some of those sellers. Around 72% of current crypto-accepting merchants said their crypto sales grew over the past year. That kind of growth helps explain why firms want to keep the option available. Barriers And Bright Spots A common complaint is that setup is still too hard. Surveys found about 90% of merchants would accept crypto if it were as easy as taking a credit card. Payment tools and integration are top concerns. Merchants list faster payments, the chance to reach new customers, and better buyer privacy as reasons to accept crypto. Younger generations are pushing the trend too — Millennials and Gen Z buyers are often the ones asking to use crypto at checkout.

PayPal and the NCA put the findings in a public release at the end of January 2026. Many executives say the next step is simpler tools and clearer rules. If merchants get easier on-ramps and reliable rails for settlements, acceptance could spread faster. Featured image from PayPal Newsroom, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Pundit Explains Why The XRP Price Hitting $100 Isn’t Delusional",
    "body": "The idea of the XRP price reaching $100 is usually dismissed almost instantly based on arguments of market capitalization and circulating supply. On paper, that math suggests a $100 value would imply a market cap valuation of at least $6 trillion, which is a figure many see as unrealistic when compared to today’s crypto market. Nonetheless, a few XRP enthusiasts are of the notion that such a framework does not apply to XRP. A crypto pundit on X, known as 24HRSCRYPTO, noted that treating XRP like a static store-of-value asset misses the entire point of what the cryptocurrency is designed to do. The Pundit’s Argument: XRP Moves Value, It Doesn’t Store It According to 24HRSCRYPTO, market cap math is misleading when it is used to judge an asset like XRP, which is designed for high-velocity settlement. 24HRSCRYPTO is an XRPL validator and fervent XRP supporter that’s always calling for ultra-bullish price targets for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Crypto Traders Share Odds Of XRP Price Rising 40% This Year, Can It Still Rally? In his words, market capitalization assumes an asset stores value, whereas a global liquidity asset moves value. XRP, from this perspective, is not meant to warehouse trillions of dollars but to facilitate the rapid movement of capital across systems, borders, and currencies. Based on this logic, if XRP is used to free trapped capital and settle transactions at scale, the same units of liquidity can be reused repeatedly within a short period of time with huge demand. Price, then, reflects the demand plus the level of trust placed in the system and the volume of economic weight it is clearing, not how much money is sitting still. Under that framework, static market cap comparisons are a poor proxy for what XRP could be valued at in a fully deployed global settlement role. With this in mind, 24HRSCRYPTO noted that XRP at $100 isn’t delusional; it’s reality. Why Market Cap Math Dominates The $100 Debate The skepticism around a $100 XRP price comes from straightforward math. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $1.92 and is about 5,100% away from reaching $100. XRP currently has a circulating supply of 60.85 billion tokens, and multiplying that supply by $100 produces a $6 trillion market cap, which is larger than the current market cap of the entire crypto market. Related Reading: XRP Funding Rates And Spot Volume Tell An Interesting Story For Price Market cap is treated as a hard ceiling based on this angle. The assumption is that for XRP to trade at $100, trillions of dollars would need to sit idle inside its market cap at the same time. That logic works reasonably well in theory for XRP. However, 24HRSCRYPTO is of the notion that the logic is for crypto assets like Bitcoin, whose primary function is holding value, and the assumption breaks down when applied to a liquidity-focused network asset. However, this claim does not, in fact, guarantee that XRP can trade at $100 without the cumulative market cap of circulating tokens reflecting such an amount.

    "body": "OKX has announced the launch of the OKX Card in Europe, expanding its payments footprint across the European Economic Area. The product allows users to pay with stablecoins at merchants that accept Mastercard, positioning crypto balances for direct everyday use rather than requiring prior conversion or preloaded fiat balances. Related Reading: XRP Derivatives Reset: Open Interest Drops Nearly 60% From July Peak The announcement comes at a time when crypto infrastructure is increasingly intersecting with traditional financial rails. While price action across major assets remains volatile, platforms are continuing to build payment and settlement tools aimed at reducing friction between on-chain assets and real-world spending. Rather than introducing a new payment concept, OKX is formalizing an existing demand: using stablecoins as a transactional medium within regulated environments. The broader relevance of the launch lies less in novelty and more in how crypto-native mechanics—such as self-custody and on-chain settlement—are being adapted to conventional consumer payment formats. Crypto Payments, DeFi, and TradFi Convergence According to the details released by OKX, the OKX Card enables direct stablecoin payments without requiring users to manually convert assets or preload funds. Stablecoins remain in the user’s wallet until purchase, when conversion occurs at checkout. The card charges no transaction or FX fees and applies a stated 0.4% market spread when converting stablecoins to euros. It is issued via a licensed European payments partner and operates under standard AML and KYC requirements within the EEA. The card supports Apple Pay and Google Pay, and functions anywhere the Mastercard network is accepted. OKX also confirmed a limited rewards program, offering crypto-denominated cashback during the initial launch period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives Pressure Hits 30-Day Extreme, Price Refuses To Break This launch reflects a broader trend: firms are repackaging DeFi infrastructure into TradFi-facing products. These companies now embed core DeFi elements—self-custody, on-chain settlement, and stablecoin liquidity—directly into regulated consumer tools like payment cards. This does not replace DeFi, but extends its utility beyond native crypto environments. DeFi is no longer only an alternative system running in parallel, but a backend layer increasingly integrated into traditional financial interfaces. OKB Consolidates After Sharp 2025 Repricing OKB is trading near $107 on the daily chart, consolidating after a sharp repricing cycle that unfolded in the second half of 2025. The structure reflects a classic post-rally digestion phase rather than active trend continuation. After peaking above the $220–$240 area, the price entered a prolonged corrective move that erased a large portion of the prior advance and shifted market control back toward sellers. From a trend perspective, the moving averages define the current regime clearly. OKB remains below the 50-day moving average (blue), which has turned down and continues to cap upside attempts. The 100-day moving average (green) is also sloping lower, reinforcing a zone of layered resistance between roughly $120 and $135. In contrast, the 200-day moving average (red) is still rising and currently sits just below price, acting as a key medium-to-long-term support reference.

    "title": "XRP Could Enter New Growth Phase After Clarity Act Decision — Here’s How",
    "body": "XRP may be approaching a pivotal turning point as regulatory uncertainty is moving closer to resolution with the upcoming Clarity Act decision. If the Clarity Act establishes a clearer framework, XRP could unlock fresh capital flows, renewed exchange participation, and broader integration across the financial platforms. This moment could represent the transition from consolidation to a new phase of sustained growth. How Clear Rules Could Reshape XRP Market Perception The passing of the Clarity Art will trigger XRP to go absolutely parabolic. An analyst known as Bird has highlighted on X that the Clarity Art is designed to make the rules of crypto regulation straightforward. It will tell in the market which digital assets will be legally allowed and which are not. As the resolution inches closer, XRP has already been tested in court and was not classified as an illegal security. Related Reading: What Does XRP Really Do? Expert Explains What It Is Built For Thus, when the rules become clear across the entire crypto market, companies, banks, and investors can finally use and hold XRP without worrying about regulatory backlash. These clear rules mean more trust, more capital, and more use for XRP. Bird’s view is that this is exactly why the court case was meant to happen, because it has positioned XRP to front-run every other digital asset. While retail traders are watching the price, banks and institutions are positioning for it. Crypto analyst LukeSuther pointed out that the XRP price action is being deliberately constrained, not out of bad faith, but out of necessity, because participants can’t migrate global settlement infrastructure into a market that’s still fully volatile and speculative. Before true price discovery can happen, regulation, liquidity corridors, compliance frameworks, and integration with legacy financial systems must be in place. However, if XRP were already operating in a completely open, utility-driven market, LukeSuther argues that it wouldn’t be trading at $2.00. Instead, the price will remain compressed while the institutions load and the rails are being built. Why Infrastructure Matters More Than Market Narrative The founder of Lux Lions NFT and host of the Crypto Blitz YouTube show, RipBullWinkle, stated that what started as a digital asset experiment is now evolving into real capital markets infrastructure. Brad Garlinghouse and Tony Edward break down XRP’s institutional adoption trajectory during an X Spaces discussion. Related Reading: XRP Advances As A Recognized Digital Asset In Regulated Markets — Here’s How According to RipBullWinkle, the conversation wasn’t about price targets. Rather, it was about real-world utility in the cross-border settlements and liquidity infrastructure that traditional finance is quietly integrating into the blockchain-based rails. While the market is busy chasing narratives, foundations are being built in public view. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "What’s Going On With The US Dollar And How Does It Affect Bitcoin, Ethereum Prices?",
    "body": "The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices rallied after reports of the US dollar crashing spread across the market. Recent data show that the US dollar has fallen to its lowest level in four years, raising concerns about the strength of the world’s dominant reserve currency. As the dollar weakens, market players are beginning to shift attention to alternative assets such as precious metals and digital currencies, including BTC, which is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against rising inflation and currency depreciation. US Dollar Falls To Lows Not Seen In 4 Years New reports from Bloomberg highlight the relentless slide in the US dollar index (DXY) over recent weeks, with the price tumbling further after President Donald Trump’s comments on the currency’s performance. Sources reveal that Trump said the dollar is “doing great,” despite its ongoing downturn. Related Reading: Analyst Says Chainlink Price Could Crash 50% If This Level Fails Traders interpreted the President’s seemingly indifferent response to the declining dollar as a signal that the slide could continue, triggering further selling pressure. Data from the web-based stock market research platform Finviz shows that, as of writing, the US dollar index has crashed to 95.92 from a previous level near 100. This marks its weakest level in nearly four years, specifically since 2022. Additionally, Bloomberg reported that its Dollar Spot Index also recorded its lowest four-day decline since Trump announced new tariffs in April 2025. Traders in the $9.5 trillion per-day currency markets are also increasingly betting that the dollar could decline further, as US policy risks weigh on the world’s primary reserve currency. Amidst the decline in the US dollar index, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are posting gains. BTC’s price rose above $89,000, while Ethereum has climbed more than 3% to reach above $3,000, in the past 24 hours. This simultaneous rally in cryptocurrencies alongside the weakening US dollar suggests that investors may be shifting capital to risk-on assets. Market analyst ‘Master of Crypto’ recently outlined several reasons behind the continued decline in the weakening US dollar in a post on X. He explained that large budget deficits, the FED’s challenge of balancing inflation control with job market stability, steady bond supply, and FX hedging activities are keeping the US dollar near recent lows. According to him, in this type of market environment, holding idle cash becomes a significant risk for investors. Related Reading: Here’s How Much XRP Ripple Execs Have Dumped So Far Possible Implications For The Bitcoin And Ethereum Price Historically, periods of US dollar weakness have often coincided with rallies in Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies. When the dollar declines, investors sometimes seek alternative assets to preserve value. This can increase demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are viewed by many as alternative stores of value and risk-on assets. While this correlation is not a clear indication of a potential cryptocurrency rally, analysts like ‘Milk Road Macro’ suggest that the declining dollar could help support a broader crypto market recovery. He said that as the dollar weakens, capital will flow into precious metals like gold and silver. Soon after, this same capital is expected to rotate into BTC, potentially fueling a price rebound.

    "title": "Here’s Why The Hyperliquid Price Is Exploding Again",
    "body": "The Hyperliquid price is seeing renewed bullish momentum, recording double gains over the last week and bucking the broader crypto market downtrend. This comes thanks to bullish fundamentals in the token’s ecosystem, including a rise in open interest on the decentralized exchange (DEX). Why The Hyperliquid Price Is Rising The Hyperliquid price is up over 58% in the last seven days, outpacing the broader crypto market as Bitcoin trades just below the psychological $90,000 level. This price surge has come on the back of a rise in Hyperliquid’s HIP-3 open interest. The DEX announced in an X post that open interest reached an all-time high of $790 million, driven recently by a surge in commodities trading. Related Reading: XRP, HBAR, And Litecoin: Pundit Highlights Coins To Watch In 2026 The exchange added that HIP-3’s open interest has been hitting new all-time highs each week, after being just $260 million a month ago. HIP-3 enables anyone to launch a custom perpetual market for crypto, commodities such as gold and silver, and other assets such as stocks. Thanks to this upgrade, the DEX is seeing increased trading activity, which has led to a surge in the Hyperliquid price. Notably, the Hyperliquid price has benefited from the precious metals boom, with the silver perpetuals market on the DEX seeing massive trading activity. CoinGecko data shows that the Silver perpetuals market is the third-largest traded in the last 24 hours, behind Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a trading volume of just over $1 billion. In an X post, Hyperliquid’s co-founder Jeff Yan noted that the DEX has achieved an important milestone of becoming the most liquid venue for crypto price discovery in the world. This came as he highlighted the order books for BTC perps on Binance and his DEX. He added that Hyperliquid has also grown to become the most liquid venue for perps on traditional-finance (TradFi) assets. Little Selling Pressure And Huge Buying Pressure For HYPE In an X post, Hyperliquid stakeholder Henrik noted that the Hyperliquid price is also rising as major selling pressure is gone. On the other hand, HYPE is seeing significant demand, including from digital asset treasuring companies such as Hyperliquid Strategies. He further highlighted the imminent Kraken HYPE listing, which is also bullish for the token. Meanwhile, Henrik stated that Hyperliquid dominates all trading metrics, including volume and open interest. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Prices Are Still Crashing Hard The increase in the DEX’s trading activity is also significant and bullish for the Hyperliquid price, as the majority of fees earned on the protocol are directed to the Assistance Fund, which is used to buy back HYPE tokens on the open market. DeFiLlama data shows that the DEX is currently among the top five protocols by fees generated over the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the Hyperliquid price is at around $34, up over 27% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Medium, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "South Dakota has a new bill on the table that would let the state put up to 10% of certain public funds into Bitcoin. Reports say Rep. Logan Manhart filed House Bill 1155 this week, restarting an effort that stalled last year. Related Reading: PayPal Survey: 4 In 10 US Merchants Now Accept Crypto The measure would change state investment rules to give the State Investment Council explicit authority to hold Bitcoin in its portfolio. Lawmaker Files Bill For Bitcoin Reserve According to filings and public posts, Manhart’s proposal mirrors a move he tried in 2025 and keeps a clear cap on exposure: 10% of the moneys made available for investment. The bill text says the limit “may not exceed 10%” and lays out options for how the exposure could be taken, including direct holdings or regulated products. A South Dakota lawmaker is reviving a push to bring bitcoin into state finances. Republican Rep. Logan Manhart introduced House Bill 1155, which would allow the state to invest up to 10% of eligible public funds in bitcoin. It’s a renewed effort after a similar bill stalled… pic.twitter.com/hPBbiSB6zT — Timmy Shen (@timmyhmshen) January 28, 2026 The new push comes after last year’s proposal was deferred in committee. Reports note that HB 1202 was put aside during the 2025 session and did not advance, and Manhart signaled he would try again in 2026. That history matters because it shows the idea has support in some corners but also faces practical and political hurdles. What The Bill Allows Based on reports, the bill not only sets a 10% ceiling but also tries to handle custody and security concerns. It mentions requirements such as using qualified custodians or exchange-traded products, encrypted storage, and multi-signature controls. Those rules are aimed at lowering the risks that come with holding a volatile asset with public money. Supporters say Bitcoin could act as a hedge and add a new type of asset to the state’s mix. Opponents point to volatility and possible legal or accounting issues when state funds are used in this way. Related Reading: Record Pain: Bitcoin Investors Suffer $4.5B Loss, Most In 3 Years The debate will likely hinge on how the State Investment Council evaluates risk and which funds would be considered “eligible” under the bill’s language. Political And Financial Pushback There is practical pushback from fiscal watchdogs and some lawmakers who worry about public perception. Money managed for things like pensions carries duty of care. That duty was stressed last session and will be raised again now that the bill is back. The point has been made plainly and will shape committee hearings.

    "title": "Bitcoin Supply In Loss Turns Upward—Early Bear Market Signal?",
    "body": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Supply in Loss indicator has witnessed a shift in direction that has often led into bearish phases in past cycles. 365-Day SMA Of The Bitcoin Supply In Loss Has Been Rising Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin Supply in Loss has started to trend up again. This metric measures, as its name suggests, the percentage of the total BTC circulating supply that’s currently being held at some net unrealized loss. Related Reading: Next Ethereum Move Hinges On This Level, Says Glassnode Analyst The indicator works by scanning through the transaction history of each token in circulation to determine the price at which it was last transacted on the network. If this previous transaction value for any coin was greater than the latest spot price, then the metric assumes that particular token to be underwater. The Supply in Loss adds up all coins falling in this category and finds what part of the supply they make up for. A counterpart metric known as the Supply in Profit tracks the supply of the opposite type. Since the total supply must add up to a 100%, however, the Supply in Profit is simply equal to the Supply in Loss subtracted from 100. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 365-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Bitcoin Supply in Loss over the cryptocurrency’s history: As displayed in the above graph, the 365-day SMA Bitcoin Supply in Loss plummeted to the lowest point for the cycle back in October. This plunge came as the asset rallied to a new all-time high (ATH) beyond the $126,000 level. Since the low, however, the indictor has witnessed a rapid climb, a consequence of the bearish momentum that BTC has faced following its ATH. So far, the indicator hasn’t risen to a significant level compared to past capitulation levels, but the change in direction has been solidifying itself. “Historically, this shift has marked the early phase of bear markets, when losses begin to spread beyond short-term holders and gradually reach longer-term participants,” explained the quant. From the chart, it’s visible that bearish transitions in past cycles occurred as the indicator shot up, with a high value in it coinciding with the cycle bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin Social Interest Fades As Retail Chases Gold, Silver Hype Whether the recent reversal in the Supply in Loss is the beginning of something similar only remains to be seen. Earlier in this cycle, an upward turn in the indicator ended up only being temporary, as the H1-2025 drawdown gave way to renewed bullish momentum rather than a prolonged bear phase. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $89,000, up over 1% in the last 24 hours. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView.com",

The moves are recent and the numbers are concrete enough to grab attention, yet they raise as many questions as they answer. Related Reading: PayPal Survey: 4 In 10 US Merchants Now Accept Crypto Flare Bridging And Activity According to Flare, roughly 91.69 million XRP have been bridged onto its network. About 75% of that stock is said to be actively put to work onchain. Reports say the Flare vault system shows 90.55 million XRP in its core vault after inflows and outflows were counted, and the FXRP wrapper is reported to hold 91.67 million tokens with a 100% reserve ratio. The new Flare XRP Yield Vault crossed $10.54 million in TVL inside 30 days. That last figure is quick growth for a product aimed at XRP holders who until now had few options for earning yield.

Activity has been recorded across a set of strategies and the wrapped FXRP is being moved into other protocols. That activity has been supported by a vault system built by Upshift, which automates yield processes and applies predefined risk controls. Reports indicate that returns are generated through a mix of onchain strategies, though details on how those yields may change over time have not been fully outlined. Based on past market patterns, yield levels across crypto platforms have tended to decline once incentive programs are reduced. At the same time, the use of bridges and smart contracts introduces added technical complexity, which has previously led to disruptions and losses across the sector. Where The Yield Comes From Reports note that other firms have adopted similar models. Axelar and Hex Trust are among those that issued wrapped XRP tools that earn returns when deployed. That means multiple places are trying to make XRP productive.

GTreasury, acquired by Ripple for $1 billion in October, launched a product called Ripple Treasury this month. These moves add weight to the wider story but do not change the mechanics of how onchain yield is created or kept. Featured image from Yahoo Finance, chart from TradingView",

Ethereum failed to stay above $3,000 and started a fresh decline. The price is trading below $2,990 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $3,000 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $2,880 zone. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price managed to remain stable above $2,880 and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to clear the $2,920 and $2,950 resistance levels. The bulls even pumped the price above $3,000. However, the bears remained active near $3,050 . A high was formed at $3,040 and the price started another decline. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent upward move from the $2,784 swing low to the $3,040 high. Besides, there was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $3,000 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,980 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls remain in action above $2,920, the price could attempt another increase. Immediate resistance is seen near the $2,980 level. The first key resistance is near the $3,000 level. The next major resistance is near the $3,050 level. A clear move above the $3,050 resistance might send the price toward the $3,120 resistance. An upside break above the $3,120 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,180 resistance zone or even $3,200 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,000 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,920 level. The first major support sits near the $2,880 zone or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent upward move from the $2,784 swing low to the $3,040 high. A clear move below the $2,880 support might push the price toward the $2,820 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,780 region. The main support could be $2,740. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

    "title": "‘Paper’ Bitcoin Isn’t Suppressing Price – Silver Shows Why, Jeff Park Says",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s unusually subdued options pricing and weak month-to-date activity are setting up what ProCap CIO and Bitwise adviser Jeff Park calls a dangerous asymmetry: upside momentum is unlikely without volatility, and the longer BTC stays “quiet,” the more violent the eventual move could be. In a post via X on Jan.27, Park described the current tape as “still a trader’s market,” arguing that low implied volatility and thin participation are a poor foundation for a clean grind higher. “It is very unlikely for Bitcoin to find momentum to the upside without experiencing significantly higher volatility,” he wrote. “The fact that we are at ~38 IV combined with horrible volume MTD gives me pause (lower than ANY month of 2025, and especially bad for January in general) when you can see what the metals complex is doing. You literally can’t imagine a worse set up for disappointment.” What Happened In Silver And Why It Could Repeat For Bitcoin Park’s reference point is a silver market that has gone from strong to disorderly. Silver prices have surged above $117 per ounce on Monday, with reports pointing to a speculative bid layered on top of tight physical conditions and heavy retail participation via bars, coins, and physically backed ETFs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Won’t Break Out Until The Fed Steps Into Yen/JGB Chaos: Arthur Hayes The move also featured a sharp single-day jump. On Jan. 26, the most-active silver futures contract rose 14%, the largest one-day gain since 1985. That price action coincided with a staggering surge in trading and options activity across silver vehicles. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the scale: “WHOA: The volume in the SLV is $32b.. that 15x its avg and by far the most volume of any security on the planet. For context, SPY is $24b, NVDA and TSLA $16b. Can’t remember the last time something so relatively small took over like this. Game Stop maybe.” WHOA: The volume in the $SLV is $32b.. that 15x its avg and by far the most volume of any security on the planet. For context, $SPY is $24b, $NVDA and $TSLA $16b. Can’t remember the last time something so relatively small took over like this. Game Stop maybe. pic.twitter.com/s6lVajUq4J — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 26, 2026 He later added that SLV “ended up trading $40b worth of shares [on Monday],” adding: “To put that into perspective, that’s more than it traded in all of Q1 last year. Jan + Feb +Mar = $35b. Options volume also in stratosphere. It’s already done $1.5b in pre-market, which is 3x more than any other ETF, 5x more than Tesla, Nvidia. Again, reminds me of Game Stop in its how is this even possible-ness.” “Paper” Exposure As An Accelerant A common crypto refrain is that “synthetic” or “paper” bitcoin suppresses spot price. Park argued the opposite dynamic is often underappreciated and he used silver to illustrate how leverage and market structure can turn into the catalyst. Related Reading: Expert Who Nailed The Bitcoin Top Now Says Buy At These Levels “People often blame incorrectly that ‘synthetic/paper’ bitcoin is the cause of price suppression,” Park wrote. “I have long argued it is quite the opposite, which you can see how it manifests in silver below- Silver didn’t have a 6-sigma event because the spot market was so vibrant.” In his telling, silver’s melt-up wasn’t driven by orderly spot demand; it was driven by the “shenanigans” inside financialized exposure. “Silver’s record-setting meltup comes from all the shenanigans behind ‘paper silver’ where margin rules, leveraged instruments and vehicles, and liquidity and maturity transformation mismatches create tremendous pressure on breaking points where no physical supply can be introduced fast enough to counter the velocity of paper supply,” he said. “For Park, the takeaway is directional but not calendar-specific. “To root for Bitcoin is to root for its volatility,” he wrote. “Anyone who tells you otherwise does not understand the fundamentals of the commodities market … It may not be today or yet tomorrow, but eventually Bitcoin is going to rip many faces off. Volatility or bust.” At press time, BTC traded at $89,430. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",
