    "title": "Analyst Outlines The Bull Case For XRP And Why Price Will Hit All-Time High Soon",
    "body": "XRP is now back to trading just above the $2 level after an early January rally briefly carried its price action into the $2.40 range. The pullback has so far been controlled, with price holding above former resistance that has now turned into short-term support. A technical analysis shared on X by crypto analyst Bird proposed that conditions are now right for a familiar macro setup that has preceded XRP’s largest historical rallies. The focus of this outlook is on XRP’s reaction with the US dollar index and what its next move could mean for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Crypto Market Watches As Clarity Act Enters Senate Debate Next Week: US Senator How DXY Weakness Has Always Unlocked XRP Rallies Bird’s analysis is based on the US Dollar Index, or DXY, and its inverse relationship with XRP during important phases. The chart accompanying his post pointed to three previous periods, around 2017, 2021, and 2024, where sustained weakness in the dollar coincided with aggressive upside moves in XRP. In each of those cycles, red candles on the DXY chart led to a loss of dollar strength, while XRP responded with strong upward expansion shortly after. This recurring pattern means that XRP’s largest moves tend to follow macro shifts, not just even events related to XRP. When dollar dominance fades, capital always rotates into crypto assets, and XRP has been one of the primary beneficiaries of that transition. Interestingly, the current setup shows that DXY has returned to a similar structural zone seen before past rollovers. As shown in the chart below, the DXY is now trending downwards. US Dollar Index, XRPUSD. Source: @Bird_XRPL On X XRP To New All-Time Highs? The first highlighted phase captures the late-2017 to early-2018 cycle, when a weakening dollar backdrop lined up with XRP’s rally run into the cycle peak in the mid-$3 range. A similar relationship appeared around the 2020-2021 window, where dollar softness was followed by XRP surging to $1.90 at its cycle top. The latest was in H1 2025, which culminated in XRP reaching its current all-time high of $3.65 in July. The important context is why the current moment is a decision point. At the time of writing, the DXY is sitting around 99, and from here it can either turn lower and start printing red candles again or catch a bid and print green. If DXY starts printing red candles again and rolls over, the pattern Bird is pointing to suggests the macro backdrop becomes supportive for another strong XRP leg higher, which is why a new all-time high above $3.65 could come into view within the next few months. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator If DXY prints green and strengthens, that would be the opposite signal: it can tighten liquidity conditions and keep XRP’s price action capped in consolidation around $2 before any breakout attempt. Either way, the dollar’s next move will signal what comes next. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin STH SOPR Rises Above 1 — A Trend Reversal Signal?",
    "body": "Bitcoin continues to hover within the $90,000 price range, producing no significant price movement in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, a subtle on-chain development is indicating a potential change in market trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Is Not In At $126,000, According To The Business Cycle, Here’s Why STH SOPR Above 1 — Bullish Rebound Or Fakeout? The Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR) is a key on-chain metric that judges investors’ sentiment. In definition, the STH-SOPR measures whether Bitcoin holders are presently selling their assets at a loss or at a profit. According to pseudonymous analyst CryptoMe, this important on-chain metric has recently flashed an eye-catching signal that could imply a trend reversal following months of deep market corrections. Notably, Bitcoin slipped into a prolonged downtrend in early October, after establishing its current all-time high at $126,100. On October 10, which represents the initial phase of this price correction, CryptoMe states the STH-SOPR fell below 1.0 in line with its natural behavior. As seen in the image above, the Bitcoin STH-SOPR stays below 1.0 during bear seasons to indicate that BTC holders are exiting at a loss. During this period, it is also observed that 1.0 midline acts as an effective resistance, restricting upward STH-SOPR movement to signal that the market structure remains weak. Alternatively, in bullish markets, the STH-SOPR moves above 1.0, which becomes a strong price floor provided a buy-side dominance remains. According to CryptoMe, this latter positive scenario has occurred in the past week, marking the first instance after October 10. In line with standard interpretation, CryptoMe explains that this recent development represents a new hope for a possible trend reversal if the STH-SOPR sustains its move above the 1.0 threshold. Notably, an opposite case would suggest a fake-out and possibly reinforce existing bearish market sentiments. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maintains Mid-$90k Levels: Possible Price Targets — Analyst Bitcoin Market Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $90,590, after a negligible 0.13% gain in the past 24 hours. However, its daily trading volume is down by 66.41% and valued at $13.38 billion. This suggests that market participation is fading out amid a sustained consolidation. In terms of a potential breakout, emerging market catalysts suggest an equal potential for the price to swing in either direction. For example, the odds of the Federal Open Market Committee implementing a rate cut have dropped drastically from 95% to 5%. Following recent predictions, the policy committee is likely to hold the rates steady, which may draw out a possible negative reaction from Bitcoin. On the other hand, regulatory developments in the US are shaping up positively. Most notably, the Clarity Act has been slated for a markup session, indicating progress toward regulatory clarity that could encourage further institutional and retail investment.

    "title": "Ethereum’s Inverted Chart May Be Setting Up Its Next Major Move: New ATH Soon?",
    "body": "Ethereum’s price action has spent an unusually long time moving sideways, and this behavior has tested the patience of many long-term bullish investors. When speaking of sideways movement, this movement has dragged on for many months, although Ethereum did manage to make a new all-time high in 2025. Interestingly, a technical analysis shared on X by Egrag Crypto shows how Ethereum’s current price action fits into previous playouts when viewed through an inverted monthly chart. This offers a perspective on what appears to be stagnation about to break into new price highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator A Repeating Cycle With Changing Behavior The analysis is based on an inverted monthly Ethereum chart, which offers an interesting perspective that flips conventional interpretations of price movement. Ethereum’s inverted monthly chart shows a consistent pattern that’s changing with time in market structure across multiple cycles. A look at the inverted chart shows that previous price cycles were characterized by short accumulation phases followed by aggressive moves. As the market matured, those accumulation zones stretched out, and the resulting moves became less violent and more controlled. The first instance was in 2016, when Ethereum traded in a range for about 10 months before breaking out and going on a violent drop. A similar structure appeared between mid-2018 and mid-2020, when a longer consolidation phase preceded another drop that played out gradually at a softer pace. The current cycle, however, is playing out with a much longer accumulation. Therefore, the eventual drop should be shorter, according to Egrag Crypto. Inverted Ethereum Price Chart. Source: @egragcrypto on X A Drop Here Actually Means A Breakout The most important detail in this technical framework is that the chart is inverted. What looks like a downside move on this view actually points to upside expansion on the real Ethereum price chart. According to the previous outcomes, once Ethereum exits this range, the next move is likely to unfold quickly. It may not match the explosive nature of early-cycle rallies, but it is expected to be more orderly, sustained, and carry Ethereum to new price highs. When the structure is converted back into real price terms, Egrag Crypto identifies the $3,800 to $4,500 area as the first critical zone. This region represents initial resistance that must be cleared to confirm a bullish continuation. Only after a decisive move above this range would the $6,000 to $7,500 zone come into focus as a realistic upside target. Related Reading: Crypto Market Watches As Clarity Act Enters Senate Debate Next Week: US Senator The analysis also highlights a defined risk scenario. A pullback to the $1,800 to $2,200 region would postpone the breakout and act as a final shakeout before a final lift-off. However, as long as Ethereum holds its broader consolidation structure, such a retest would not invalidate the thesis. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,100.

    "body": "After retreating from late-2025 highs, Bitcoin has spent much of recent trading days fluctuating between the mid-$80,000s and low-$90,000s, with buyers consistently stepping in on dips and sellers defending the same resistance level. Interestingly, this technical setup resembles the structure Bitcoin formed before its last major rally that eventually pushed it to its price peak above $126,000. Related Reading: Crypto Market Watches As Clarity Act Enters Senate Debate Next Week: US Senator Bitcoin Revisits A Familiar Consolidation Structure A closer look at BTC price action on the daily candlestick timeframe chart shows that the leading cryptocurrency is tracing a pattern that looks very similar to what played out between March and May 2025. In that earlier phase, Bitcoin spent weeks trading between roughly $76,000 and $86,000, repeatedly failing to break higher and giving the impression of stagnation. During that time, the Bitcoin price held above support levels and continued to print lower lows within the range and gave the impression of a lack of immediate upside. That consolidation ultimately proved to be a base. Once Bitcoin broke above the upper boundary of that range at $86,000, the sentiment changed very quickly and created the stage for a strong upside move that eventually led to Bitcoin. The current structure shows the same characteristics, only at a higher altitude. This time, Bitcoin is ranging between approximately $84,000 and $94,000, with price compressing in a similar way to early 2025. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: @aganstwallst On X Why Bitcoin Might Push To New ATHs The $94,000 level has become the primary area determining Bitcoin’s current upward price action. Bitcoin’s price action tested this zone during an early January rally, briefly pushing toward $94,500 on January 5 before facing rejection and dropping back into correction. That rejection is now in the past, and the next priority is what Bitcoin might do once it finally secures a decisive break above this resistance. The previous performance is a good reference point for what could follow a confirmed breakout. After Bitcoin cleared $86,000 during the prior consolidation last year, it pushed up for many months, eventually reaching a peak price of around $126,080. That move represented a gain of about 46% from the breakout level. No two price movements can play out in exactly the same way, but the similarities between the current setup and last year’s structure suggest that Bitcoin may once again be building energy below resistance. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator If Bitcoin delivers a comparable expansion after breaking above $94,000, the projected upside targets would extend a little above $126,000 and lead to the creation of a new all-time high.

This feat signals the rising investor demand for the XRP exchange-traded funds despite the waning interest in the broader crypto ETF market. As mentioned earlier, the US-based XRP ETFs registered their first negative performance in the past week, with a net outflow of $40.8 million on Wednesday, January 7. However, this single-day performance didn’t stop the exchange-traded products from ending the week in the green. Data from SoSoValue reveals that the XRP ETF market saw an additional $38.07 million in value for the week ending January 9. However, a look at the chart shows that the capital inflow for the crypto-linked products is steadily declining. As of this writing, the spot XRP ETFs have accumulated $1.47 billion in total net assets since launching in mid-November 2025. Canary Capital’s XRPC tops the list with $375.1 million in net assets under management (AUM), followed by Bitwise’s XRP fund at $300.3 million, and Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ at $279.6 million. XRP ETFs Shine While Crypto ETF Market Flounders While the XRP ETFs seem to be enduring the market storm, the more-established Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have seen better days. According to recent market data, the crypto funds saw a combined withdrawal of $749.6 million during their first full trading week of the year. Most notably, the spot Bitcoin ETFs saw their largest single-day net outflows of $486.1 million on Wednesday, January 7. The BTC exchange-traded funds closed the week with a net outflow of over $681 million. Meanwhile, the Ethereum ETF market, which started on a positive note with inflows of $168.1 million on January 5 and $114.7 million on January 6, eventually ended the week with net withdrawals of $68.6 million.
