    "title": "Ethereum Is 58% ‘Undervalued’ Based On Intrinsic Metrics, Says Hashed CEO",
    "body": "Ethereum is trading far below its modeled “intrinsic value,” according to a live valuation dashboard launched by Hashed CEO Simon Kim. On ETHval (ethval.com), the current snapshot shows Ethereum at a spot price of $3,034.0 while the reliability-weighted “Composite Fair Value” stands at $4,777.5, implying +57.8% upside versus the market. The median fair value across models is $4,026.68, or +33.8% above spot. The dashboard labels ETH “UNDERVALUED” and aggregates its eight models into five buy, one hold and two sell signals. How The Fair Value Of Ethereum Is Calculated Kim introduced the project on X with the explicit goal of shifting the discussion away from pure sentiment: “What is ETH actually worth? The crypto industry deserves better than price speculation. I built a dashboard to think about ETH’s intrinsic value with 8 models… Far from perfect and open to feedback.” ETHval makes those models and their outputs fully visible, along with their individual reliability tags. Related Reading: Ethereum Price To Recover Or Crash? The Real ‘Leverage Point’ Investors Should Know About The tool’s central panel breaks out each valuation. The TVL Multiple model, which prices ETH off total value locked in DeFi using a 7× TVL-to-market-cap anchor, assigns a fair value of $4,026.6, judging ETH 32.7% undervalued (reliability: medium). A more conservative MC/TVL Fair Value mean-reversion model, treated as high reliability, lands at $3,453.1, only 13.8% above spot and classified as “fair.” Models that embed stronger network-effect or cash-flow claims are far more aggressive. The DCF (Staking) framework, which discounts an implied perpetual stream of staking rewards, values ETH at $9,101.9, indicating it is 200.0% undervalued. A high-reliability Metcalfe’s Law implementation, which scales value with TVL to the power of 1.5, is even more bullish at $9,585.9, or 216.8% above the current price. The Ethereum L2 ecosystem model, which adds twice the TVL of major rollups to Ethereum mainnet TVL before applying a multiple, generates a fair value of $4,640.0, implying 52.9% undervaluation, although ETHval marks this model’s reliability as low. A Staking Scarcity model, also low reliability and based on liquid-supply contraction, prices ETH at $3,538.2, or 16.6% undervalued. Related Reading: Ethereum Steadies Near $2,900 as Fed Rate-Cut Odds Fuel $3,400 Rebound Hopes Two income-style models push in the opposite direction and still receive high reliability scores. The P/E Ratio (25×) model treats annualized protocol fees as “earnings,” applies a 25× multiple and arrives at a fair value of only $957.4, reading ETH as 68.4% overvalued. The Revenue Yield model reverse-engineers price from a target protocol yield of 2.5%; at current revenue levels it outputs $1,531.8, implying 49.5% overvaluation. To synthesize these conflicting signals, ETHval applies a disclosed weighting scheme: high-reliability models are multiplied by 9, medium by 5 and low by 2 when computing the $4,780.7 composite. That weighting, combined with the extreme upside implied by the DCF and Metcalfe models, is what drives the overall conclusion that Ethereum is strongly undervalued despite two respected frameworks pointing to downside. The dashboard itself stops short of making investment recommendations. Underneath the numbers, ETHval reiterates that the outputs are for reference only and that each model rests on explicit, debatable assumptions. But by fixing the current ETH price at $3,034.0 against a live fair-value band stretching from $957.4 on the bearish end to $9,585.9 on the most bullish, Kim’s site quantifies a debate that usually plays out in anecdotes and narratives—and, for now, that quantified view leans clearly toward Ethereum being undervalued. At press time, ETH traded at $3,029. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Crypto analyst NeverWishing has predicted that the XRP price will rally to as high as $1,115. He highlighted three paths for XRP to reach this target, in what the analyst described as the final bull run for the altcoin. Analyst Maps Out Final XRP Bull Run Rally To $1,115 In a TradingView post, the crypto analyst mapped out three paths for XRP to rally to the $1,115 target. They tagged the first path as the immediate delivery, the second as a normal delivery, and the third as one that will trigger only if the XRP price stays suppressed. For the third path, NeverWishing stated that a final backup execution could happen between January 1 and 6 next year. Related Reading: The Bull And Bear Scenario For XRP That Could Play Out In November For path A, NeverWishing stated that it will start between this month and next month, with the first impulse sparking an XRP rally to between $30 and $33. The secondary spike will send the altcoin to $186, while a consolidation phase will lead to a climb toward $285. After that, XRP will rally to its final blow-off target of $1,115. NeverWishing described the second path as the fastest, stating it will occur between January and March next year. The first stop will be between $30 and $33 for XRP, after which volatility waves will occur through February and March. The altcoin will then break into the macro expansion zone, with the major target at $285 and the final target at $1,115. The Third Path For XRP The analyst noted that the third path is smoother and slightly delayed. NeverWishing also reiterated that this is a suppressed variant and will only happen if the first and second paths fail. They explained that if the XRP price stays held down, then the algorithm will reset and fire between January 1 and 6 next year. Related Reading: Why XRP Price Crash Below $2 Is Not A Problem – $20 Is Still The Target XRP will have the same opening move as the first two paths, rallying to between $30 and $33. It will then have the same structure as the second path, with the macro targets being $285 and $1,115. NeverWishing then outlined the key timing windows for XRP as it eyes a rally to this $1,115 target. The first key timing is between this month and January 2026, which marks the entry and breakout window. The analyst tagged March 21, 2026, as the mid-cycle reversal point in the XRP final bull run. August 14, 2026, marks the “warning zone,” while the pullback is expected between October and November 2026. Lastly, NeverWishing stated that January 1, 2027, is the final liquidity window. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.20, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "Solana (SOL) is showing remarkable resilience this week, holding firmly above the critical $140 support zone despite heightened market anxiety following a $37 million hack on South Korea’s Upbit exchange. Related Reading: The Bull And Bear Scenario For XRP That Could Play Out In November The stability comes at a time when institutional interest in Solana is accelerating, highlighted by Franklin Templeton’s recent Form 8-A filing with the U.S. SEC to launch a Solana ETF. Franklin Templeton’s Solana ETF Fuels Institutional Momentum The global investment giant, which manages $1.67 trillion in assets, is positioning itself at the forefront of crypto-focused investment products. The proposed ETF would offer regulated exposure to Solana without requiring investors to hold the token directly, a move widely seen as a bullish catalyst for long-term adoption. Historically, ETFs have had mixed but notable effects on crypto markets. Bitcoin surged to new all-time highs after its ETF debut in 2024, while Ethereum took months to show similar momentum. Analysts say it remains unclear whether SOL will follow the Bitcoin pattern or display a more gradual response once the ETF is approved. SOL's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Upbit’s $37M Solana Hack Sends Shockwaves, But SOL Stays Steady Upbit confirmed an unauthorized outflow of roughly 54 billion KRW (about $37 million) involving SOL and several Solana-based tokens. The exchange immediately halted deposits and withdrawals, moved remaining assets into cold storage, and pledged to fully reimburse affected customers from its own reserves. While such incidents typically trigger steep price drops, Solana’s ecosystem demonstrated surprising stability. Not only did SOL hold above $140, a multi-month high-timeframe support zone, but Solana memecoins such as BONK, TRUMP, and MOODENG barely reacted. Traders pointed to on-chain data showing buyers aggressively defending key support levels, even as broader market sentiment wavered. Upbit has already frozen ₩12 billion worth of stolen LAYER tokens and is working with partners to trace additional assets. The timing of the breach, occurring nearly six years to the day after Upbit’s notorious 2019 hack, has drawn attention but has not shaken confidence in Solana’s network. Technical Outlook: Rebound or Breakdown? Analysts highlight $142–$145 as the immediate resistance band, supported by an estimated 13 million SOL accumulated at that level. A breakout could open the path toward $165, $188, and even higher liquidity pockets at $220–$240. Longer-term projections suggest potential targets between $360 and $480 if Wyckoff reaccumulation patterns complete. However, a failure to maintain $143 support could send SOL toward deeper zones at $130–$127. Related Reading: Has The Bitcoin Price Hit Its Bottom?

    "title": "Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Hit $100 Before Bitcoin Hits $1 Million",
    "body": "A crypto analyst has issued a decisive projection that challenges the long timelines often associated with major price milestones for Bitcoin. His outlook was presented in response to the ultra-bullish forecasts from Michael Saylor and Jack Mallers, who have spoken openly about the possibility of Bitcoin reaching between $1 million and $20 million per coin. Rather than focusing on Bitcoin’s distant targets, the analyst directed attention to XRP, insisting that XRP will reach $100 long before Bitcoin touches the seven-figure mark. Analyst Says XRP Will Reach $100 Before Bitcoin’s Million-Dollar Target There have been many bullish predictions of Bitcoin breaking above the $1 million mark in recent months, with notable names like Michael Saylor and Cathie Wood pointing to million-dollar targets. Related Reading: Analyst Claims XRP Will Flip Bitcoin As These Developments Play Out However, an analyst who goes by the name 24HRSCRYPTO on the social media platform X referenced Saylor and Mallers’ price prediction, which places future Bitcoin valuations in the tens of millions per coin and implies a market cap approaching $500 trillion. He contrasted those long-range projections with what he believes is a more attainable and nearer-term milestone for XRP. Punching in the numbers shows that XRP is a 4,445% move away from $100 based on its current price level of around $2.2. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is 990% away from the $1 million price. Even with that difference, the analyst noted, “You will see XRP at $100 before Bitcoin hits $1 million.” The statement points to the view that XRP is positioned for faster price growth in the foreseeable future, as seen by price dynamics in the past few months. The crypto is increasingly being positioned in a situation where demand and adoption of the Ripple ecosystem could take it to new heights. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s price action is slowing down relative to XRP. Notably, technical analysis of the XRP/BTC pair places XRP on the path to outperforming Bitcoin in the coming weeks and months. The Altcoin Will Hit $1,000 Before Bitcoin Touches $19 Million The analyst extended his projection even further by asserting that XRP could rally to $1,000 before Bitcoin comes close to the $19 million figure referenced by Saylor. Such a valuation for Bitcoin would imply a market capitalization of roughly $500 trillion, a scale far beyond anything seen in global financial history. Related Reading: Analyst Claims XRP Price Will Surge To $220 Due To ETFs, But Is This Possible? Measured from today’s levels, Bitcoin would need to climb roughly 20,635% to reach the $19 million mark. XRP’s path to $1,000 amounts to an even larger jump of about 45,300%, which corresponds to a market cap of $60 trillion based on its current circulating supply. Still, XRP reaching $1,000 is, in his view, more feasible than Bitcoin reaching millions per coin. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "Avalanche (AVAX) is back in the spotlight after reclaiming its position among the top 20 cryptos to surpass Hedera (HBAR), just as Securitize secures EU approval to launch the region’s first fully regulated blockchain-based securities market on the Avalanche network. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New ‘Line In The Sand’ May Be $82,000, Not $56,000: Analyst This convergence of regulatory momentum, institutional adoption, and renewed technical strength has positioned AVAX for a potential market revival heading into 2026. AVAX's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: AVAXUSD on Tradingview Securitize Wins EU Approval and Selects Avalanche for Settlement System Securitize received regulatory authorization from Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) to operate a tokenized trading and settlement system under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime. The approval enables Securitize to passport the license across the European Single Market, including France, Germany, and Italy, creating an unprecedented bridge between its U.S. broker-dealer operations and Europe’s capital markets. The firm confirmed that the entire infrastructure will run on the Avalanche blockchain, citing sub-second finality, regulatory-grade network performance, and scalable architecture. This move positions Avalanche at the center of institutional tokenization just as Securitize prepares for a $1.25 billion SPAC merger and expands its portfolio, including managing the now-over $1 billion BlackRock BUIDL on-chain treasury fund. The first EU-compliant issuance is slated for early 2026, opening the door for a wave of regulated tokenized assets, an estimated $18 trillion market by 2033. AVAX Price Holds Key Support as Technical Signals Improve While fundamentals surge, AVAX’s price remains compressed near the long-term support zone around $12–$15. The token recently bounced to $14.94, posting a 6.5% daily gain and breaking above its 7-day moving average at $13.96. It now faces a technical showdown with resistance at the 20-day SMA at $15.21. Momentum indicators are turning constructive. RSI sits at a healthy 42, MACD shows bullish divergence, and Stochastic momentum favors buyers. A breakout above $15.21 could open the path toward $18.61, with a larger target near $33 if long-term trendlines snap. However, failure to hold above $13.91 risks retesting deeper support near $12.57. Institutional Accumulation Strengthens Bullish Outlook Fueling optimism, AVAX One Treasury recently accumulated over 9.37 million AVAX, spending $110 million between November 5 and 23. Total reserves now exceed 13.8 million AVAX, signaling robust long-term institutional confidence. On-chain metrics support the bullish case. Deployed contracts are rising, developer activity is expanding, and futures taker data shows increasing buyer dominance. These combined forces suggest that AVAX may be carving out a medium-term bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Climbs Back To $91,000: Is The Decline Over?

    "title": "USDT Goes Mainstream In Bolivia As Gov’t Approves Crypto Banking",
    "body": "Bolivia has moved to bring stablecoins into its formal banking system, a shift that could change how people save and pay for things in the country. Banks will be allowed to offer accounts, custody and payment services tied to stablecoins such as USDT, government statements and local reports disclosed. The move follows a sharp rise in crypto use as people seek ways to hold dollar-pegged value amid currency pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces More Downside After Recent Crash, Data Shows Banks To Offer USDT Accounts Reports have disclosed that Economy Minister Jose Gabriel Espinoza announced the change, and at least one lender, Banco Bisa, has already begun offering custody and transfer services for USDT. Based on reports, crypto transactions in Bolivia jumped dramatically last year, with some counts showing growth of more than 500% and figures putting crypto activity at $294 million in the first half of 2025. Those numbers have pushed regulators and banks to respond more directly. 💥 BREAKING: 🇧🇴 Bolivia to integrate Bitcoin and crypto into its financial system, starting with stablecoins pic.twitter.com/Qb0Tj7pern — Bitcoin Archive (@BitcoinArchive) November 26, 2025 Everyday Payments And Savings People and businesses are reportedly testing USDT for real payments. Some shops and service providers have shown prices in USDT, and certain sectors — such as car dealers and firms handling imports — are said to be accepting stablecoin payments for some transactions. According to market observers, the change is partly a response to shortages of physical US dollars and to rising costs that make the local currency less stable for saving. Banks will be able to create savings products denominated in stablecoins, and may offer loans or payment options tied to them. Cross-Border Transfers And Remittances Based on reports, one obvious use will be cross-border transfers. Stablecoins can offer a dollar-pegged option when access to actual US dollars is limited. That could help businesses that buy fuel or other imports and families that receive money from abroad. Still, practical hurdles remain: many people are unbanked or lack easy internet access, and broad adoption will take infrastructure, training and clear consumer protections. Regulatory Limits And Risks According to analysts, the government’s plan does not make stablecoins legal tender in place of the boliviano. Rather, it lets regulated banks provide crypto-linked services under the financial system. That means accepting USDT will likely stay voluntary for merchants. There are also risks to watch: stablecoin liquidity, custody safety, and how well banks manage anti-money-laundering rules. Consumer education and stronger oversight will be needed to protect ordinary users. What Comes Next Several months of rollout and pilot programs are expected, and observers will be watching transaction volumes and how many banks and businesses sign on. If the system grows, Bolivia could become an example for neighboring countries facing similar currency stress. But the deeper economic problems that pushed people to crypto — inflation and limited dollar access — will still need government solutions beyond new payment rails.

    "title": "30% Of Crypto Market Makers Got Wiped, Mike Novogratz Says",
    "body": "Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz says the October 10th crash in crypto was far more than a routine shakeout, claiming that roughly a third of market makers in parts of the ecosystem were effectively wiped out. “We had a flash crash and it did a lot of damage to the fabric of the market,” Novogratz told Anthony Scaramucci on the first-ever episode of “All Things Markets,” recorded November 26. “Even on Hyperliquid, the market makers, you know, 30 percent of them went out of business. Got zeroed.” Scaramucci framed the last 20 trading days as another brutal reminder of crypto’s structural volatility. “I know I have a trap door on my portfolio,” he said. “Once in a while I’ll be walking across the living room feeling beautiful about myself. And then, boom, a trap door opens and I have fallen into the basement of the house.” Related Reading: Will Crypto Explode If Kevin Hassett Takes Over The Fed In 2026? According to Novogratz, this particular trap door opened at Binance. “It started really by, you know, at Binance, they had an oracle which set price misfunction,” he said. That error hit a synthetic stablecoin and “created a cascade where people were getting stopped out because there was the wrong price.” The dislocation then bled into levered perpetual markets “like Hyperliquid, like Uniswap,” where “as prices went down, people started getting liquidated.” He argued that the way crypto participants use leverage turned a technical glitch into a systemic event. “What people don’t understand about crypto is that the crypto investor doesn’t play for 10, 11, 12 percent returns,” he said. “Crypto investor call themselves degens with pride. They want to turn one into 15. And so they trade a very volatile asset with a lot of leverage.” Perpetual futures make that leverage particularly dangerous for liquidity providers. “Perpetual futures are not normal futures,” Novogratz said, crediting “the genius that Arthur Hayes and his group of people” for a design where “as longs get liquidated, they’re paired off against shorts.” In a fast collapse, “you could be short and you lose your short position. Well, if you’re long on another exchange against that short position, you’re shit out of luck. And that happened to a lot of market makers.” Will The Crypto Market Recover? The result, he said, was a sharp loss of liquidity and retail capital. “We lost a lot of liquidity in the market. We lost a lot of retail punters who lost their stack,” he noted, adding that after such a wipeout “it takes a while for Humpty Dumpty to get put back together again.” Novogratz said he initially expected higher levels to hold. “I actually, to be fair, thought we were going to hold at higher levels at $90,000,” he admitted. “And we went all the way to $80,000. $80,000 was a maximum pain point… Got to $1.80 on XRP. We got to $125 on Solana. Real pain points.” He links the subsequent rebound to macro tailwinds, not healed sentiment. “Now we bounce up. We bounce because of the Fed. But we’re not out of the woods,” he said. “I do think Bitcoin will climb back towards $100,000 by the end of the year, but there’ll be sellers waiting there. We’ve done some medium-term damage to the psychology of the market.” Related Reading: Crypto Has Entered Late-Cycle Territory, Says Global Liquidity Veteran On the spot side, he highlighted massive profit-taking by early holders against ETF-driven inflows. “We had one $9 billion seller,” he said. “That’s one-third of all of IBIT’s flows of the year.” As US wealth channels move “from a zero weighting to a 3 to 4 percent weighting” in Bitcoin, that “was met with OG sellers.” “In the long run, that’s healthy,” he said. “In the short run, that’s painful.” Novogratz also argued that crypto is being repriced as a real business ecosystem rather than a pure story. “It’s a transition from just being a story — ‘we’re the most important industry… we’re going to decentralize the world’ — to ‘show me what crypto actually does,’” he said. “Some businesses are making money. Some businesses aren’t. There are some token ecosystems that make common sense to an investor and there’s some that all feel like they’re just an association.” Overlaying it all is a macro backdrop he views as increasingly supportive. He called the Fed’s recent signals and plans to ease bank cash requirements in repo “a monstrous liquidity boom that’s coming,” adding that “they’re going to bring rates down to 2 percent in the next 16 months” and that inflation will “creep higher,” implying negative real rates. For crypto, the message is double-edged: structurally de-levered, with fewer market makers and wounded sentiment, but still tied to a global liquidity cycle that Novogratz believes is turning in its favor — once Humpty Dumpty gets put back together again.

As the below chart shows, the STH Realized Profit/Loss Ratio was at relatively high levels earlier, but since early October, its value has plummeted. With a value of just 0.07, the indicator is now sitting deep inside the loss region, a sign that the recent Bitcoin buyers have overwhelmingly been capitulating at a loss. “Such overwhelming loss dominance confirms that liquidity has evaporated, especially after the heavy demand absorption seen in Q2–Q3 2025 as long-term holders increased their spending,” explained the analytics firm. The metric fell to similar lows back in Q1 2022, but so far, market weakness hasn’t been as prolonged. The report noted that if the ratio continues to be depressed, market conditions could mirror those from back then. While short-term demand momentum has collapsed, the same hasn’t been true for long-term liquidity, at least not yet. Long-term momentum can be measured using the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio of the long-term holders (LTHs), representing the more resolute section of the market (holding time greater than 155 days). From the above chart, it’s visible that the 7-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the Bitcoin LTH Realized Profit/Loss Ratio has witnessed a sharp decline as BTC has crashed. Despite the drop, however, the metric’s value is still 408, implying LTHs are realizing, on average, a profit that’s 408 times the loss. This means that the long-term liquidity is still healthy compared to Q1 2022, or even the major bottom formations from the current cycle. Glassnode warned, however, “if liquidity continues to fade and this ratio compresses toward 10x or lower, the probability of transitioning into a deeper bear market becomes difficult to ignore.” Related Reading: XRP Rebounds From Channel Bottom, Analyst Says $2.60 Could Be Next It now remains to be seen how the LTH Realized Profit/Loss will change for Bitcoin in the near future, and if liquidity will see a further squeeze. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $90,600, down 1.3% over the past week. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com",

The price is trading above $2,960 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,950 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above the $3,080 zone. Ethereum Price Eyes More Gains Ethereum price managed to stay above $2,880 and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to climb above the $2,920 and $2,950 levels. The bulls were able to push the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,165 swing high to the $2,620 low. The bulls even pumped the price above $3,000 but they struggled to clear the $3,080 zone. The price failed to settle above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,165 swing high to the $2,620 low. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,960 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,950 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If there is another upward move, the price could face resistance near the $3,050 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,080 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,120 level. A clear move above the $3,120 resistance might send the price toward the $3,165 resistance. An upside break above the $3,165 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,220 resistance zone or even $3,250 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,080 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,950 level. The first major support sits near the $2,880 zone. A clear move below the $2,880 support might push the price toward the $2,840 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,800 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,750 and $2,740. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone. Major Support Level – $2,950 Major Resistance Level – $3,080",

    "body": "Thailand has officially adopted a new tax-rule giving a 0% personal income tax rate on capital gains from cryptocurrency trades — but only under certain conditions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces More Downside After Recent Crash, Data Shows According to regulation Ministerial Regulation No. 399 (MR 399), profits earned from selling or transferring cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin via exchanges, brokers, or dealers licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand (SEC) will be tax-free from January 1, 2025 until December 31, 2029. What The 0% Tax Means Under the new scheme, individual investors who trade crypto through SEC-licensed platforms don’t pay personal income tax on any gains. The exemption applies only if the trade is done on a local approved exchange, broker, or dealer. FACT: THAILAND NOW OFFERS 0% CAPITAL GAINS TAX ON #BITCOIN TRADED ON NATIONAL EXCHANGES GLOBAL GAME THEORY AT WORK ✨ pic.twitter.com/8rf21xJxKT — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) November 26, 2025 Regular income tax rules apply to the same type of income for taxpayers who participate in foreign/unlicensed exchange activity, as well as those who generate crypto income from mining, staking and/or airdrops. The publication of this regulation in the Royal Gazette on September 5th 2025 makes it official and enforceable by law. Reaction to this regulation was also positive from both officials and investors: an official statement indicates the primary purpose of creating this regulation was to provide incentives for current and future traders to use local regulated exchanges as opposed to using foreign/unregulated exchanges. They hope this will strengthen Thailand’s financial system and bring more transparency into crypto trades. Some analysts expect the policy to draw both local and international interest in Thailand’s licensed exchanges. The government seems to try making its digital-asset sector more competitive while ensuring regulatory compliance. What Investors Should Know To benefit from 0% tax, trades must go through valid, licensed channels. Gains from outside platforms or unapproved services don’t qualify. Accurate records of purchase and sale, including dates and exchange receipts, are vital to prove eligibility if asked by tax authorities. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Reenters ETH Market, Fires Off A $44-M Long The exemption runs only until December 31, 2029. After that date, the law will need review or renewal. So traders thinking long-term should consider what might happen after 2029. This policy shift represents a significant signal from Bangkok to both domestic and global crypto players. It makes compliant crypto trading cheaper — maybe more attractive — while drawing a clearer line between regulated and unregulated channels. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Bullish Rebound Sparks Path Toward The $98,000 Imbalance Zone",
    "body": "Bitcoin is showing new signs of strength after its sharp decline, with buyers stepping back in and momentum shifting upward. With price reclaiming key support levels, the path toward the major $98,000 imbalance zone is now back on the table, but bulls still need to prove this rebound has real conviction. FVG Filled, Bearish OB Tagged — What Comes After The Perfect Hit? Crypto analyst Crypto Patel, in a recent market update, noted that Bitcoin has now completed a key technical move by filling the Fair Value Gap (FVG) and tapping directly into the Bearish Order Block exactly as previously projected. He emphasized that traders who avoided shorting the $81,000–$85,000 region and instead positioned for the upside likely captured a clean and predictable long setup. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New ‘Line In The Sand’ May Be $82,000, Not $56,000: Analyst With that phase now complete, the focus shifts to Bitcoin’s next major target. Patel highlights the $96,800–$98,000 FVG as the upcoming high-timeframe imbalance zone. From a broader perspective, Patel still expects Bitcoin to make a move toward the $98,000 zone before any significant corrective leg unfolds. This aligns with his macro outlook, which continues to favor a final upward sweep into that region before momentum weakens again. However, he also outlines a clear invalidation point for the bearish bias. A sustained high-timeframe close above $107,550 would negate the existing bearish market structure entirely. Such a breakout would signal the start of a new bullish phase for Bitcoin, potentially setting the stage for a fresh all-time-high trend. Promising Bounce As BTC Defends the $90,000 Support Zone According to The Boss, Bitcoin’s latest price action is showing early signs of strength. After the sharp decline, BTC reacted firmly at the local support and managed to push back above the $90,000 level, indicating that buyers are stepping in with renewed confidence. The chart now reflects a stable support zone that has held up against downward pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Market Confirmed? Expert Predicts Price Target Of $40,000 By Late 2026 Part of this rebound appears to be driven by improving macro sentiment. Softer expectations around Federal Reserve tightening, a rise in overall risk appetite, and a shift back toward risk-on assets are all contributing to Bitcoin’s recovery attempt. From a technical perspective, The Boss notes that Bitcoin must continue to hold above the $90,000–$91,000 range to form a meaningful upward wave from this base. However, caution is still warranted. Without clear confirmation from momentum indicators and sustained trading volume, the current move has the potential to be limited. The possibility of a dead-cat bounce remains on the table, especially following such an aggressive sell-off. Featured image from Pngtree, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Puell Multiple Plunges, But Not Inside Bottom Zone Yet",
    "body": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Puell Multiple has gone through a decline recently, a sign that miner revenue has gone down relative to its baseline. Bitcoin Puell Multiple Has Dropped To 0.67 In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Puell Multiple. The “Puell Multiple” refers to a popular on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the daily BTC mining revenue (in USD) and 365-day moving average (MA) of the same. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Be At Risk Of A Deeper Bear If This Ratio Compresses, Says Glassnode Miners earn their income through two sources: block subsidy and transaction fees. In the context of the metric, however, only the former part of their revenue is relevant. Block subsidy is a fixed BTC-denominated reward that miners receive when they add the next block to the chain. Usually, it makes up for the dominant and stable part of miner income. When the value of the Puell Multiple is greater than 1, it means that the network validators are earning a higher revenue from block subsidy than the average for the past year. On the other hand, the metric being under the mark implies miners are making less than usual. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Puell Multiple over the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Puell Multiple has witnessed a rapid decline recently that has taken its value below the 1 level. This drop in the metric is a result of the bearish price action that the cryptocurrency has faced. The block subsidy is fixed in BTC value and is more-or-less also fixed in rate of time, so the daily BTC income from it is about constant for miners. The USD value of the reward, however, is dependent on the asset’s spot price, which is indeed variable. The earlier bull run resulted in the Puell Multiple rising above the 1 mark as miner revenue from block subsidy surged. Similarly, the market downturn has led to a decline in the USD miner income. Today, the metric’s value is 0.67, meaning that the chain validators are making just 67% of the average revenue from the last 365 days. Historically, miners being under a high amount of pressure has made bottoms more probable for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New ‘Line In The Sand’ May Be $82,000, Not $56,000: Analyst As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, the major bottoms since 2015 have generally formed when the Puell Multiple has dipped below 0.50. If the current cycle is also going to follow a similar pattern, then miner pain may not be enough for a bottom yet. BTC Price The latest rebound in the Bitcoin price has sustained for now as its price is still trading around $91,600. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Hyperliquid (HYPE) Ready For A Significant Surge To $50: Key Levels Identified",
    "body": "After dipping below the $30 mark last week, Hyperliquid (HYPE), the native token of one of the rapidly expanding decentralized exchanges (DEXs), has managed to recover by 2% this Thursday, positioning itself to benefit from this latest upward movement that has seen the leading cryptocurrencies recover key levels. HYPE Poised For A New Rebound Market analyst OxMakeSense has highlighted the potential roadmap for HYPE to reach $50 in the short term, just below all-time high levels of $59, indicating that the token is starting to show the first signs of a significant shift. He emphasizes that the upcoming levels are filled with untouched liquidity, which could facilitate a climb for HYPE. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Climbs Back To $91,000: Is The Decline Over? Key Levels To Watch Following a month of pressure, the analyst asserted that the asset recently formed its first solid rebound, suggesting that the selling pressure has begun to ease and market reactions are gaining strength. OxMakeSense identifies a crucial checkpoint for Hyperliquid in the $37–$38 price range, marking where the last breakdown occurred. If HYPE can reclaim this level, he suggested that it could lead to a squeeze of “trapped sellers.” Additionally, surpassing the $38 threshold would open up the chart for a direct move toward the $41–$42 range, an area described as “thin” with little major resistance left from prior sell-offs. Analyst Warns Of Potential Retracement To $25 In his social media analysis, OxMakeSense noted that the momentum pivot sits at a significant level of $44. He stated that strong trends typically begin by reclaiming mid-range levels like this one. Should HYPE flip this resistance into support, it is expected to accelerate further. Above $44, HYPE would enter a clearer trajectory, with targets aligning at $48 and ultimately at $50, where a substantial amount of untouched liquidity resides. Related Reading: Metaplanet In Jeopardy: Bitcoin Needs To Surpass $108,000 By December 18 To Prevent New Crisis However, not all analysts share the same bullish outlook. Fellow analyst Crypto TXG has expressed concerns regarding HYPE’s recent performance, pointing out that it lost the $35.8 level and found a temporary bottom near $28.5. While HYPE has reversed the trend, it is currently testing the $35.8 mark from below, which acts as a barrier. If HYPE can break through this resistance, the next target would be $42.3. Conversely, if it fails at $35.8, another pullback could occur, potentially retesting the $28.5 support more decisively. Adding to the cautious sentiment, market expert Ali Martinez has indicated that if the token retests the breakdown zone, there is a possibility it could revisit the $25 mark. This suggests that, despite the recent uptick, a short-term retracement of approximately 28% could be on the horizon. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Best Wallet Token’s Presale Ends in 3 Hours: Last Chance to Buy Before Listing",
    "body": "What to Know: Current wallets often force a trade‑off between centralized risk, clunky UX, and minimal user benefits, leaving mainstream crypto users underserved. Fragmented multichain activity and chaotic presale access highlight the need for a unified, mobile‑first wallet hub with built‑in economic incentives. Best Wallet Token builds a Fireblocks‑powered, non‑custodial wallet with multichain DEX aggregation and curated presale access through its Upcoming Tokens portal. $BEST underpins reduced fees, staking rewards, and higher APY opportunities, aligning user growth with token demand as Best Wallet targets mass adoption. Crypto has quietly shifted back into ‘build and buy infrastructure’ mode. Traders aren’t just chasing memecoins anymore – they’re hunting tools that actually make Web3 usable: safer wallets, better UX, and lower friction for multichain swaps and presales. Wallets sit at the center of that stack, but most haven’t evolved in years. You still juggle browser extensions, clunky mobile apps, and centralized providers that can freeze you out or blow up overnight. On the other hand, hardcore non-custodial wallets often feel hostile to newcomers, with confusing approvals, no real benefits for loyal users, and little support for cross-chain flows. That gap is where Best Wallet is trying to plant its flag. It positions itself as ‘The Next Gen Crypto Wallet,’ aiming to merge institutional-grade security, clean mobile UX, and actual economic perks for holders. And Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the official token of this ecosystem. With 1 $BEST still priced at $0.026015 in presale and the raise already above $18.1M, the market has effectively pre‑voted on the thesis before any exchange listing. You can read our analysis of Best Wallet Token for more context. Best Wallet Builds A Mobile-First, Benefit-Driven Web3 Hub Best Wallet is designed as a mobile-first, non‑custodial wallet that tries to feel like a fintech app, not a developer tool. You get an intuitive interface, no KYC, and support for thousands of assets across 6+ chains, while still retaining self-custody of your keys and funds at every step. Under the hood, it’s the first fully integrated Fireblocks MPC‑CMP wallet in this segment, combining advanced key management with custom multi-wallet portfolios for more sophisticated users. An Upcoming Tokens portal curates the best crypto presales , giving you simplified access to vetted early‑stage opportunities instead of trawling Telegram threads or DEX listings alone. For trading, the Best DEX aggregator is powered by Rubic, routing orders across 50+ chains, 330+ DEXs, and 30 cross‑chain bridges to seek competitive pricing and fewer failed swaps. And what powers all of this is the wallet’s official token, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – here’s how to buy $BEST now and join the presale. How High Could $BEST Go If Adoption Lands? If Best Wallet captures 5% of the global crypto wallet market, $BEST could reach a speculative $0.05106175 by the end of 2026, delivering roughly 97% returns from the current presale price of $0.026015. Read our $BEST price prediction to see why this estimation is within reason. Token utility is designed to reinforce that adoption loop. An 8% allocation – 800M $BEST – is reserved for staking rewards via a dynamic pool where your yield scales with your share of total staked tokens. Crucially, staking is available during presale, giving early participants a way to put idle allocations to work immediately. On top of that, $BEST holders are set to receive reduced fees across the Best Wallet ecosystem, higher APY options in the staking aggregator, and access to exclusive presales and iGaming partnerships through the Upcoming Tokens portal. If those perks pull users away from older wallets, the upside case becomes less theoretical and more realistic and promising. Best Wallet’s pitch is simple: combine institutional‑grade security, a mainstream‑ready mobile experience, deep multichain connectivity, and actual token‑holder benefits into a single app. With the presale still at $0.026015 and over $18.1M already raised, the project is trying to lock in a user base before the next wave of wallet competition hits. Whales have bought over $155K yesterday and today ($84.5K here , $59.3K here , and $12k here ). If you think the next cycle rewards usable infrastructure over pure speculation, $BEST is positioned as a leveraged bet on that thesis. You’re not just backing a token – you’re backing a wallet that aims to be the first screen every new crypto user opens. Join the $BEST presale before it ends in under 3 hours.

    "title": "Solana Reclaims Crucial Resistance Despite First SOL ETF Outflows – 25% Rally Ahead?",
    "body": "As the crypto market rebounds from the recent lows, Solana (SOL) has reclaimed a crucial level, nearing a key resistance area that could set the stage for a long-awaited price recovery rally, according to some market watchers. Related Reading: Ethereum’s End-Of-Year Rally Still At Play? Analysts Eye 50% December Jump Solana Bounces Despite ETF Outflows The crypto market has surged above the $3 trillion mark for the first time in a week, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most leading cryptocurrencies reclaiming crucial support levels lost during the latest market pullback. Solana joined the market rally and jumped from the recently recovered $135-$140 area to the upper zone of its local range on Wednesday afternoon. Notably, the altcoin has been trading between the $130-$145 price range over the past two weeks, briefly losing the lower boundary during last week’s correction. This week, SOL’s price has reclaimed some crucial ground, surging over 10% since Monday’s opening and nearing the $145 resistance. Amid this performance, analyst Ted Pillows noted institutional participation, as SOL treasury companies have started to show early signs of recovery. He also highlighted that Solana Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have experienced record inflows this month despite the correction. According to Farside Investors’ data, the SOL-based investment products have registered $613 million in inflows since their launch on October 28. It’s worth noting that throughout the recent pullbacks, Solana funds have seen a strong demand, with a 22-day positive streak while the altcoin’s price descended to multi-month lows. However, as its price recovered, SOL’s ETFs registered their first negative in nearly a month. 21Shares’ TSOL, which launched a week ago, saw $34 million in outflows on Wednesday, outshining the over $13 million and $10 million in inflows of Bitwise’s BSOL and Grayscale’s GSOL. As a result, the whole category recorded net outflows of $8.1 million. In his analysis, Ted Pillows also noted that “It seems like SOL has bottomed for a while, but institutional buying needs to accelerate here. Otherwise, it won’t take long for Solana to make new lows.” SOL Ready For December Recovery? Analyst Ali Martinez suggested that Solana’s pain might be over as its price “usually bottoms when investors capitulate… And for the past two weeks, that’s exactly what’s been happening.” According to the chart, SOL’s price has historically found a floor when the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) indicator reaches the capitulation zone, which it has recently fallen to. Meanwhile, Crypto Patel highlighted that Solana is breaking out of a one-month downtrend, which could trigger a 25% recovery rally near the key $180 barrier in the coming weeks. Another market observer warned that the altcoin is “walking straight into the lion’s den” as its price nears the $144-$146 resistance levels. Trader Mr. Ape noted that Solana’s price has been rejected three times from this heavy supply area, and momentum “is slowing again as we hit the zone.” Related Reading: XRP ETFs Outshine BTC, ETH, And SOL Funds With $164M Single-Day Inflows To the trader, this is the crucial level to watch, as another rejection could send the price to the $132 support, where strong demand lies from the previous bounce. On the contrary, a successful breakout from this level and reclaiming it as support could confirm the shift and trigger a surge to the $157 area. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $142, a 7.7% increase on the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Tom Lee $100K Bitcoin Prediction Wakes Sleeping Whales for Bitcoin Hyper",
    "body": "What to Know: Tom Lee’s $100K Bitcoin target reinforces the idea that this cycle still has upside, pushing traders toward higher-beta plays beyond BTC itself. Bitcoin’s core limitations (slow throughput, variable fees, and no native smart contract) are driving intense interest in Layer 2 designs that unlock scalable, programmable $BTC liquidity. Competing Bitcoin L2 approaches now range from EVM sidechains to rollups and SVM-based execution layers, each trying to capture the next wave of $BTC-driven on-chain activity. Bitcoin Hyper introduces an SVM-powered Bitcoin Layer 2 with extremely low-latency execution and $BTC-settled smart contracts, targeting DeFi, payments, and gaming use cases. When Fundstrat’s Tom Lee publicly floats a $100K Bitcoin target before year end, it doesn’t just light a fire under $BTC. It revives the idea that this cycle still has serious upside left, and that the most aggressive upside often comes from narrative-driven plays orbiting Bitcoin rather than $BTC itself. If you’ve traded previous bull markets, you’ve seen this movie before. As soon as big-name analysts turn openly bullish, attention turns from Bitcoin into higher-beta sectors. This includes leverage products, Bitcoin Layer 2s, and infrastructure tokens that can outperform if $BTC actually makes that leg higher. That’s where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) starts to make more sense on trader watchlists. Instead of being ‘just another alt,’ it’s pitched as a direct way to amplify a renewed Bitcoin move. How? By unlocking the one thing $BTC has never had at scale: fast, programmable blockspace tied back to Bitcoin’s settlement layer. In that context, Bitcoin Hyper isn’t competing with Bitcoin. It’s monetizing the gap between Bitcoin’s perks (security, brand, liquidity) and trader demands: sub-second execution, low fees, and a place to deploy real DeFi and dApps around $BTC. As more readers dig into Tom Lee’s thesis, expect a growing chunk of them to ask not only ‘Can Bitcoin hit $100K?’ but also ‘What could ride its coattails the hardest if it does?’ That’s the funnel where narrative-heavy infrastructure plays like Bitcoin Hyper tend to live. You can read a dedicated breakdown in our ‘ what is Bitcoin Hyper ’ guide. Why Bitcoin Layer 2 Narratives Heat Up In Late-Cycle Rallies The structural problem hasn’t changed: Bitcoin settles around 7-10 transactions per second on L1, with variable fees and no native smart contracts. That’s fine for long-term holders. But the building potential is capped without a Layer 2 that handles high-throughput execution. As price targets like Lee’s $100K call re-enter the discourse, that technical ceiling becomes a trading angle. If $BTC does break higher, on-chain activity and speculative demand for ‘Bitcoin-adjacent’ yield, DeFi, and leverage historically spike. Infrastructure that can absorb that flow (Lightning, sidechains, and new L2s) tends to capture outsized attention relative to its actual maturity. You’re already seeing a mini arms race: Bitcoin rollup experiments, EVM sidechains pegged to $BTC, and Solana-style high-throughput designs aimed at Bitcoin liquidity. Bitcoin Hyper slots in as one of those options: a Bitcoin Layer 2 that leans on the Solana Virtual Machine rather than EVM. It tries to offer Solana-like speed while staying anchored to $BTC. For traders, it’s another way to express a view that ‘this time, Bitcoin’s upside should come with usable blockspace.’ Here’s a step-by-step guide to buy $HYPER now. Inside Bitcoin Hyper’s Bet On SVM-Powered Bitcoin Blockspace $HYPER’s architecture is modular: Bitcoin L1 for settlement and finality, and a real-time SVM Layer 2 where high-frequency smart contracts and DeFi logic actually run. The thesis is simple: if you can get Solana-style performance, which includes low-latency transaction processing, sub-second confirmation, and fees closer to fractions of a cent), but with $BTC as the underlying asset and settlement layer, then you potentially unlock a very different flavor of the Bitcoin ecosystem. High-speed payments in wrapped $BTC, AMMs, lending markets, NFT platforms, and gaming dApps can all execute on SVM while periodically anchoring state back to Bitcoin. Technically, Bitcoin Hyper uses a single trusted sequencer with periodic state anchoring to Bitcoin, plus a Decentralized Canonical Bridge for $BTC transfers into the L2. SPL-compatible tokens are modified for this environment, letting Solana-native devs port Rust-based code and tooling into a Bitcoin-centric context with relatively low friction. For builders used to Solana’s SVM, that’s a powerful on-ramp. On the token side, the presale has already raised $28.6M, with tokens currently priced at $0.013345. Smart money is moving as well: one whale bought $500K $HYPER two weeks ago . If you’re betting that Bitcoin’s next leg includes not just higher prices but more sophisticated on-chain activity, Bitcoin Hyper is effectively a leveraged play on that thesis via SVM-powered blockspace. Join the $HYPER presale now for a 40% staking APY. This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, investment, or trading advice; always do your own research.

    "title": "Bitcoin Ready For $250,000 As ETF Basis Trade Dies, Says Arthur Hayes",
    "body": "Arthur Hayes believes Bitcoin’s October flush to $80,000 marked the end of a liquidity-driven reset, not the start of a new bear market – and that the structural forces that pushed BTC down are now reversing. $80,000 Was The Bottom As Dollar Liquidity Turns In a Milk Road Show episode recorded November 26 and released November 27, the BitMEX co-founder argued that the much-celebrated US spot ETF “institutional bid” was largely a leveraged basis trade that has now run its course at the same time as US dollar liquidity appears to have bottomed. “And so that’s why I believe that the $80,000 dip on Bitcoin recently is the bottom,” Hayes said. “And now we’re going to have a supportive liquidity situation, at least marginally on the dollar, and we’re bottom here and can go higher.” Hayes is still openly targeting a blow-off move into the $200,000–$250,000 range by year-end, repeating the call from his recent “Snow Forecast” essay. “I’m going to stick with it,” he said. “If I’m wrong it doesn’t matter. I’m long, right? I’m still happy either way. It’s either $200k–$250k or not.” Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New ‘Line In The Sand’ May Be $82,000, Not $56,000: Analyst At the time of recording, the host noted Bitcoin was “back above $90K.” Hayes said ETF flow charts that dominated crypto social media in the spring and summer badly misled retail. He pointed to the largest holders of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) – Brevan Howard, Goldman Sachs, Millennium, Avenue, Jane Street – as evidence that the dominant players were not long-only allocators. “These entities are not places where they’re just going to go long Bitcoin,” he said. Instead, they were running a standard basis trade: buying IBIT, pledging it as collateral and shorting CME futures. “They were making, let’s call it 7 to 10% per annum on that trade. They fund Fed funds at four-ish percent and they lever it up.” When the futures basis collapsed following the October 10 liquidation cascade, that trade had to be unwound by selling the ETF and covering futures shorts, flipping net ETF flows from strong inflows to outflows. Retail investors misread that as “institutions turning bearish.” “Retail thinks, ‘Oh no, institutions loved Bitcoin in the summer and now they hate it in the fall, therefore I need to get rid of my exposure as well,’ not understanding what was driving those flows in the first place,” Hayes said. He paired this with a second temporary pillar: listed digital asset treasury (DAT) companies that issue stock or debt to buy Bitcoin. Once those vehicles traded at net asset value or a discount, new issuance became uneconomic and in some cases incentivized selling BTC to buy back shares, removing another marginal buyer. Macro Conditions Are The Key Catalyst Against that micro backdrop, Hayes situates a much larger macro shift. He tracks a proprietary US dollar liquidity index built from Fed balance sheet series and commercial bank data. In his telling, roughly a trillion dollars of liquidity was drained from dollar money markets from July onward due to Treasury General Account (TGA) refilling and Federal Reserve quantitative tightening. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Now Tied To A 2-Year Cycle, Warns Investment Firm CIO In 2023, then-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen could offset that drain by issuing huge amounts of high-yielding T-bills that pulled about $2.5 trillion out of the Fed’s reverse repo facility back into the system. In 2025, he argues, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had no such reservoir to tap. Now, Hayes says, both the TGA rebuild and QT have effectively run their course. The TGA has been restored to its target zone, and the Fed has halted balance sheet runoff. “We have essentially bottomed on the liquidity chart and the direction in the future is higher,” he said, adding that markets are still waiting to see how the Trump administration actually delivers on promises of massive credit creation via industrial policy, bank lending and a more dovish Fed. He expects the next leg of liquidity to come more from commercial banks than the central bank, citing early signs of rising bank lending and public commitments from institutions like JPMorgan to finance large industrial programs. Hayes was equally direct on the October 10 wipeout, calling it a harsh lesson for underprepared leveraged traders rather than a coordinated hunt. “People think that I’m going to get off of work and trade leveraged crypto for a few hours and I’m going to somehow make money. No, you’re going to get liquidated,” he said. “If you are a proper trader, you should not get liquidated. Period.” On positioning, Hayes said he used the post-crash environment to buy what he considers fundamentally strong altcoins like Pendle, Ethena and EtherFi at levels last seen months earlier. He expects those to outperform ETH in the short term but still backs the long-term “institutional DeFi” narrative that could take Ethereum to “the $10,000 to $20,000 price by the end of the cycle.” For now, his core thesis is simple: the ETF basis trade is largely gone, the liquidity drain is over, leverage has been flushed – and the macro tide, in his view, is turning back in Bitcoin’s favour. At press time, BTC traded at $91,004. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Best Crypto To Buy As Bolivia’s Reserves Fall From $15B To $2B And Banks Embrace Digital Assets",
    "body": "What to Know: Bitcoin Hyper turns Bitcoin into a programmable, SVM-powered Layer 2, enabling low-latency BTC payments, DeFi, and gaming while anchoring security to Bitcoin. SUBBD leverages AI and Web3 to give creators lower fees, token-gated content, and crypto payouts, targeting the $85 billion content industry. Solana’s high throughput, low fees, and new US spot ETF support cement its role as a leading institutional-grade Layer‑1 blockchain. Bolivia’s reserve stress and banking pivot to digital assets underscore the growing demand for crypto infrastructure in the real world, rather than purely speculative tokens. A country’s financial stress often shows up in its policy decisions long before it appears in headlines. Bolivia’s reversal of its crypto ban and its move to let banks custody digital assets isn’t a quirky policy pivot. It’s what happens when foreign reserves fall from over $15B to roughly $2B. In such an environment, stablecoins and liquid crypto rails suddenly appear as essential survival tools. When a country with a long history of monetary controls starts legitimizing digital assets, it shows where macro pressure is heading. Capital wants neutral, censorship-resistant settlement layers. It also wants programmable money that can plug into banking pipes without IMF approval. That shift is why narrowing down the best crypto to buy means focusing on projects with real-world utility. Payment rails that can settle in BTC, high-throughput chains institutions can rely on, and creator-economy infrastructure all rise to the top. Against that backdrop, three plays stand out. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as a Bitcoin-native execution layer with near-Solana speeds. SUBBD ($SUBBD) is building AI-driven tools for creators, while a US spot ETF now backs Solana (SOL) and remains the institutional high-performance L1. Each taps into a concrete use case that becomes more valuable as countries like Bolivia rethink their financial plumbing. In markets where traditional tools fail, crypto infrastructure fills the gaps. That’s why these three assets sit at the center of the reshaping underway. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) — First SVM-Powered Bitcoin Layer 2 If Bolivia’s banks begin holding BTC, the next logical step is faster, programmable rails that still inherit Bitcoin’s security. Bitcoin Hyper positions itself precisely as the first Bitcoin Layer 2, running the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) . The goal is simple: Solana-level execution speed with Bitcoin-level trust. The design is modular. Bitcoin handles settlement, while a real-time SVM execution layer processes smart contracts and high-throughput workloads. A single sequencer currently manages ordering, with periodic state commitments anchoring everything back to Bitcoin. A Decentralized Canonical Bridge moves BTC between layers as wrapped assets. That setup enables high-speed payments, near-instant confirmations, and low fees, all powered by wrapped BTC. Developers can port SPL-style tokens , use Rust SDKs , and deploy Solana-style dApps without leaving Bitcoin’s trust model. On the capital side, the $HYPER presale has already raised over $28.6M, with tokens at $0.013345. That momentum has already fed into broader market modelling, with analysts mapping out where the ecosystem could trade once the network goes live. For a deeper breakdown of potential upside ranges, you can check our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction guide . Two high-net-worth wallets accumulated $396K recently, including a $53K buy . Staking opens right after TGE with high APY and a short seven-day presale vesting model. If you expect banks and emerging markets to route payments through Bitcoin over time, a Bitcoin-native SVM execution layer becomes a clear infrastructure play. You can learn more about Bitcoin Hyper or join the $HYPER presale directly . 2. SUBBD ($SUBBD) — AI + Web3 Stack for Creators Under Pressure Bolivia’s pivot is about financial survival, but creators are facing their own pressure as platform cuts rise and ad cycles tighten. SUBBD ($SUBBD) responds by merging AI and Web3 to give creators more control over distribution and monetization. The platform bundles AI Personal Assistants, AI Voice Cloning, and AI Influencer Creation into one toolkit. Creators can automate interactions and gate premium posts or communities behind token-based access that settles in crypto. This shift matters because programmable monetization lets a YouTuber in La Paz or a musician in Buenos Aires earn in crypto and keep ownership of their catalog. In regions dealing with FX friction and banking limits, that flexibility becomes real economic optionality. On the numbers, the SUBBD presale has raised over $1.3M, with tokens at $0.05705 and 20% first-year staking. That mix of AI tooling and on-chain monetization positions SUBBD as a targeted bet on the $85B creator economy moving into Web3. Explore the SUBBD presale today . 3. Solana ($SOL) — High-Throughput L1 Now Backed By a US Spot ETF You also want exposure to infrastructure that institutions can actually use. Solana ($SOL) has evolved from a ‘fast L1 experiment’ into a high-performance settlement layer with thousands of TPS and sub-cent fees. That performance profile matters as banks and corporates explore routing stablecoin payments or tokenized treasuries across public chains. Solana’s throughput and low fees give it real advantages for scalable payments, order books, and consumer apps. Its ecosystem has matured into one of the strongest in crypto. NFTs, DeFi, and consumer-grade applications now operate at scale without the bottlenecks seen on older networks. The shift became unmistakable when Bitwise launched the first US spot Solana ETF on October 28, 2025. It pulled in roughly $420M in the first week, signaling that institutions now treat SOL as investable infrastructure. For investors watching countries like Bolivia normalize digital assets, Solana offers liquid, battle-tested exposure to high-performance public chains. It also complements higher-beta presale plays by anchoring a broader conviction in scalable blockchain rails. Recap : As Bolivia’s reserves decline and banks adopt digital assets, structural demand shifts toward the real utility of these assets. Bitcoin Hyper , SUBBD , and Solana all align with this trend. Bitcoin Hyper targets BTC-native execution, SUBBD rewires creator monetization, and Solana anchors institutional-grade throughput, together forming a diversified way to front-run the next phase of adoption.

    "title": "Best Meme Coins To Buy Before the Shibarium 2026 Privacy Upgrade",
    "body": "What to Know: Shibarium’s planned 2026 FHE upgrade makes privacy-native, utility-rich meme coins the key narrative for the next phase of meme speculation. The best meme coins aren’t just funny tickers; they’re the ones that channel this new flow: trading, payments, and gaming volume that prefers anonymity and speed. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) fuses 1,000x meme culture with staking, competitions, and a growing presale war chest tailored to degen retail traders. PEPENODE’s ($PEPENODE) mine‑to‑earn model gamifies yield through virtual nodes and tiered rewards, aligning naturally with privacy-first, game-heavy meme ecosystems. Shibarium’s roadmap for a 2026 privacy upgrade using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is quietly one of the biggest structural shifts in meme coin history. Moving from simple dog-themed speculation to encrypted L2 rails with confidential smart contracts fundamentally changes what can be built on top of Shiba Inu. ‘Lucie,’ a Shiba Inu executive, shared that the end goal of on-chain privacy and confidential smart contracts could arrive before the end of Q2 2026. FHE-secured transactions and privacy-preserving EVM execution open the door for serious DeFi, on-chain gaming, and high-frequency trading strategies that don’t leak alpha on-chain. Meme coins can plug directly into a privacy-focused infrastructure layer designed for scalable, permissionless experimentation. In that world, the best meme coins with the best upside aren’t just funny tickers; they’re the ones that channel this new flow: trading, payments, and gaming volume that prefers anonymity and speed. You’re not just betting on dog pictures; you’re front‑running an architecture shift toward privacy-backed, utility-rich meme ecosystems. Three meme coins are positioned to ride that transition: one built for leverage-obsessed traders, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , one redefining mining culture, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , and one OG dog coin leveling up its own tech stack as privacy and interoperability go mainstream, Dogecoin ($DOGE) . 1. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Never Skip Leg-Day, Never Skip a Pump Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is built for the kind of trader who treats every bull market like leg day: brutal, focused, and unapologetically heavy. Branded as a canine juggernaut, $MAXI wraps the 1,000x leverage mentality into a meme token that lives and dies by a high-conviction, high-volatility trading culture on Ethereum. It’s the meme coin that never skips a leg-day or a pump, something degens can truly identify with. If that’s got you sold already, we’ve got your way in with our ‘ How to Buy Maxi Doge ’ guide. Under the hood, $MAXI runs as an ERC‑20 with a smart contract–governed supply and a 5% allocation dedicated to staking. Stakers earn dynamic APY currently sitting at 73%, turning idle meme exposure into a yield-generating position while you grind the charts elsewhere. It’s ‘lift, trade, repeat’ encoded directly into token economics. The $MAXI presale has raised $4.2M, with tokens currently priced at $0.0002705, giving you a defined on-ramp before any Shibarium-powered privacy narrative fully ignites. If Shibarium’s FHE upgrade accelerates demand for high-reward trading communities, a leverage-obsessed meme hub like Maxi Doge sits right in that slipstream. Join the $MAXI presale today. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): World’s First Mine-to-Earn Memecoin PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) leans into the other side of degen culture: building a pseudo-mining empire. Branded as the world’s first mine‑to‑earn memecoin, it replaces GPU rigs with a virtual mining system and a gamified dashboard that feels closer to a clicker game than a staking page. Instead of simply buying and holding, you use your $PEPENODE to buy and upgrade virtual nodes that earn tiered rewards, simulating the economics of mining without the hardware or power bill. Higher-tier nodes earn more, creating a clear progression loop that keeps you checking in, upgrading, and chasing the next yield threshold rather than passively sitting on a bag. The PEPENODE presale has already raised over $2.2M, signaling strong demand for this gamified mining narrative. Our experts also note a potential 2026 EOY price prediction of $0.0077 , giving you a possible ROI of over 558% if you bought at today’s price. As memecoins get pulled toward DeFi and on-chain gaming, a mine‑to‑earn model with tiered node rewards positions PEPENODE as a natural fit for users who want interactive yield rather than passive speculation. It’s a clear bet on meme culture evolving into persistent, game-like economies. Get your $PEPENODE for $0.0011685 and don’t miss the 584% staking rewards. 3. Dogecoin ($DOGE): OG Payments Meme Readying a Tech Overhaul Dogecoin ($DOGE) remains the original meme asset that accidentally became real money. Launched as a joke, it evolved into a peer‑to‑peer cryptocurrency for fast, low‑fee transactions, widely used for tipping creators and simple payments. That grassroots utility is now getting a serious technical upgrade. Developers are preparing the DogeOS upgrade, which is set to bolt on ZK-proof–based privacy and Ethereum-compatible smart contract support. That combination could finally push $DOGE beyond simple transfers into DeFi, Web3 gaming, and dApp ecosystems. For a meme asset that already ranks among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap and has been cited as the eighth-largest with rising institutional interest , that’s a non-trivial pivot. It means Dogecoin can realistically coexist with privacy-forward L2 environments like Shibarium, serving as both a payments rail and a composable building block. If Shibarium’s FHE roadmap pulls liquidity and users toward private, EVM-compatible meme ecosystems, a technically upgraded DOGE can act as a bridge between legacy meme liquidity and the next wave of privacy-native applications. It’s still the OG dog, but with a much sharper toolset on the way. Buy $DOGE on top exchanges like Binance. Recap: As Shibarium’s 2026 FHE upgrade drags meme coins into a privacy-first, EVM-powered future, Maxi Doge , PEPENODE , and Dogecoin each target a different vector that could help you stay ahead of the pack. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

    "title": "35% Bitcoin Correction And Hash Ribbon Bottom Signal Put SUBBD Token On Trader Radar",
    "body": "What to Know: Hash Ribbon recovery after a 35% Bitcoin correction, coupled with depressed hashprice, aligns with historic late‑stage capitulation and potential cyclical bottoms. Miner stress and hashrate pullbacks often precede cleaner supply dynamics, setting the stage for capital rotations into higher‑beta narratives like AI and creator tokens. AI‑powered creator platforms are targeting opaque fees, arbitrary bans, and fragmented tooling as Web2 subscription and fan platforms continue to extract oversized revenue shares. SUBBD combines Web3 payments with AI assistants, voice cloning, and token‑gated content to help creators keep more earnings and automate fan engagement. When Bitcoin bleeds this hard, the market’s real opportunities finally show up. A 35% Bitcoin drawdown , from $124K to around $81K, has cleared out a large amount of late-cycle leverage. Yet the rebound toward $90K, with network hashrate still ~15% below its all-time high, sits right in the zone that has historically produced cyclical bottoms. These periods tend to reset excesses without breaking long-term structure. The Hash Ribbon indicator , which measures miner stress across short- and long-term hashrate trends, is now flashing a recovery signal linked to the end of miner capitulation phases. Hashprice remains at five-year lows , pushing miners to shut down older rigs, sell reserves, or merge operations. This is textbook late-stage bottoming behavior. Anyone who’s lived through multiple Bitcoin cycles recognizes this environment: sentiment wobbles, macro headlines turn gloomy, yet the chain itself gets stronger as weak hands exit. It’s also the window when early rotation into emerging narratives, AI, RWAs, and the creator economy historically outperforms. Once Bitcoin stabilizes, these plays often lead the next leg. That’s where SUBBD comes into focus. While Bitcoin rebuilds its base, $SUBBD is aiming to fix a core problem in the $85B creator economy: platforms taking up to 70% of revenue, opaque moderation rules, and fragmented AI tooling. For traders seeking asymmetric upside before risk-on fully returns, SUBBD’s AI-powered, Web3-native creator stack is gaining attention, with independent analysts already circulating early SUBBD price projections. Why Bitcoin Capitulation Is Fueling Rotations Into New Narratives Miner capitulation historically lines up with peak fear, but also with some of Bitcoin’s strongest forward returns. As inefficient rigs shut down and miners sell reserves to survive, that final burst of sell pressure often clears the last major correction of the cycle. Once that reset hits, capital naturally starts hunting for higher-beta plays. This cycle, AI and the creator economy are two of the standout narratives pulling early rotation. AI-assisted creator platforms, decentralized media rails, and token-gated fan ecosystems are all pushing to capture a chunk of a market where platforms like OnlyFans or subscription sites can take 20–70% of creator income. It’s a gap big enough for new Web3 rails to matter. Across Solana, Polygon, and Ethereum, teams are experimenting with NFTs, micro-tipping, decentralized storage, and AI-as-a-service models for creators. SUBBD is among the Ethereum-based entrants, positioning itself as a full-stack AI and payments layer for creators rather than another one-off NFT experiment. How SUBBD Aims To Tokenize and Automate the Creator Economy Where many creator tokens simply bolt crypto onto Web2 business models, SUBBD is built around a clearer premise: merge Web3 settlement with integrated AI so creators keep more and automate more. Instead of 30–70% platform cuts, SUBBD targets transparent, smart-contract-driven revenue splits and crypto-native payouts. At the center of $SUBBD is an AI Personal Assistant that can handle chats, DMs, support, and personalized responses trained on creator-approved data. Additionally, SUBBD incorporates AI voice cloning, AI influencer tools, and object-recognition features, enabling creators to launch new formats without needing to juggle multiple SaaS tools. The token underpins access and incentives across the platform. Users can unlock token-gated content, enter VIP staking tiers, and vote on features. At the same time, creators monetize through subscriptions, PPV content, AI-exclusive drops, NFTs, and tipping via EVM-compatible smart contracts. The presale has already raised over $1.3M with $SUBBD priced at $0.05705, showing meaningful early traction. It’s a model built around both creator monetization and fan participation. To learn how you can get your hands on this upcoming token, check out our helpful How to Buy $SUBBD guide . Staking is currently at a fixed reward rate of 20% APY for year one before evolving into a ‘platform benefits’ system offering exclusive livestreams, in-house content, daily behind-the-scenes drops, and boosted XP multipliers. In a market reset following a significant Bitcoin correction, SUBBD positions itself as a bet on transparent, AI-enhanced creator rails over extractive Web2 platforms.

    "body": "According to reports, the government of Bhutan moved 320 Ethereum (ETH) into staking on November 27, 2025. The transaction was routed through Figment.io, an institutional staking provider. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces More Downside After Recent Crash, Data Shows At the time of the move, the Ether was valued at about $970,000. The transfer is being watched in both crypto and policy circles because it links a sovereign treasury to active participation in a public blockchain. Details Of The Staking Move Onchain Lens say the 320 ETH created 10 new validators, matching the network rule that each validator requires 32 ETH. The payment and validator setup were recorded onchain and were visible to blockchain trackers shortly after the move. This is Bhutan’s largest ETH action since May 2025, when the nation moved 570 ETH to a Binance wallet, based on earlier disclosures. The Royal Government of Bhutan sent 320 $ETH, worth $920.8K, for staking into #ETH2.0 @Figment_io.https://t.co/q4dW3qJBT5 pic.twitter.com/qo0evHxthf — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) November 27, 2025 Beyond Treasury Management Observers note Bhutan is not only holding crypto as an asset. By staking ETH, the country is helping to secure the Ethereum network and earning rewards that come from validator participation. Reports have disclosed the move also ties into national plans to shift parts of its digital identity project from Polygon to Ethereum. That plan would make the chain more than a place to park funds; it could become part of public infrastructure. What It Means For Bhutan Bhutan is already known to hold a sizeable amount of Bitcoin. Public data and media reporting put the country’s Bitcoin reserves at about 6,154 BTC, making Bitcoin the primary reserve asset. Staking ETH, even at a smaller scale compared with those holdings, signals that Bhutan is experimenting with using crypto not just for investment but as a tool for state services and network involvement. The action was described by some analysts as an example of a small state testing new financial and technical models. On Liquidity And Rewards When ETH is staked it becomes illiquid for a period tied to network rules. That means the staked tokens cannot be used for immediate spending or trading. At the same time, validators earn rewards that may add modest income to a state treasury. The trade-offs are clear: more participation in protocol security, less short-term flexibility in asset use. Several commentators asked whether sovereign staking will affect how other small nations treat crypto reserves. Related Reading: Crypto Wins Big: Thailand Moves To A 0% Tax On Local Exchange Gains Broader Crypto Context On the world stage the amount is modest, but the move is symbolic. Sovereign actors rarely operate validators on major smart-contract chains. This step was noticed because it ties public services and reserve management to one blockchain. Regulators, market watchers, and blockchain developers have been monitoring the transaction and related policy moves to see whether similar steps might follow elsewhere.

    "body": "Crypto analyst Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) is mapping out a sharply asymmetric setup for XRP, arguing that the token is locked in a textbook Wyckoff reaccumulation and is “still NOT bearish in the slightest” despite a year of range-bound trading. Why XRP Is Still Not Bearish His work is based on XRP/USD Bitstamp charts posted on X on 27 November 2025. On the weekly view, XRP trades around $2.23 after an 8–9% gain on the week, consolidating below the 2025 peak at approximately $3.317, which he marks as the 1.0 Fibonacci level. The retracement is drawn from the cycle low near $0.11400 up to that high, producing a ladder of levels that structure the entire thesis. Key Fibonacci levels include 0.5 at about $0.61495, 0.618 at $0.91531, 0.702 just above $1.20 and, crucially, 0.786 at $1.61246. A broad highlighted band covers the prior 2021 high zone and this 0.786 cluster, roughly from the mid-$1s into the low-$2s. Charting Guy describes this as XRP “building support on prior cycle high as well as top of golden pocket,” referring to the 0.618–0.786 retracement area. Related Reading: XRP Reserves On Binance Collapse To Record Lows: Investors Move Toward Long-Term Holding Above the 2025 high, he plots classic Fibonacci extensions: 1.272 at about $8.29661, 1.414 around $13.38940 and 1.618 near $26.63038. His immediate scenario, however, stops short of those levels, projecting a move toward roughly $7.50. XRP Price Roadmap For 2026 The detailed roadmap appears on a two-day XRP/USD chart overlaid with a Wyckoff schematic. The structure begins with a Preliminarily Supply (PSY) phase and a Buying Climax (BC) into the low-$3 zone, followed by a Secondary Test (ST) and an Automatic Reaction (AR) that defines the lower boundary of the range. Horizontal lines mark that floor near $1.61184, an intermediate band around $1.95, resistance at approximately $2.90 and the upper ceiling just above $3.30. During mid-2025, XRP prints an “UT Phase B” upthrust into that $3+ resistance before rolling into a downward-sloping channel. The upper boundary of this channel, labeled “CREEK,” connects a series of lower highs, while the lower boundary guides price back toward the $1.61–1.70 support. In the scenario path, XRP spikes down to test the blue horizontal at $1.61184. This move is annotated as the “SPRING” — Wyckoff’s final shakeout below range support. Price then rebounds to retake the $1.95 area, marked “TEST,” and establishes a higher low between roughly $2.00 and $2.20 as the first “LPS” (Last Point of Support). Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Hit $100 Before Bitcoin Hits $1 Million From there, the schematic shows a decisive break of the descending “CREEK” trendline, the “JATC” or “Jump Across The Creek,” as XRP accelerates from around $2.20–2.30 through the $2.90 resistance. That breakout is followed by a “SOS” (Sign of Strength) above the former ceiling, with another LPS holding around the $2.90 region and confirming the flip of resistance into support. The right edge of the 2D chart then projects a steep markup phase. XRP rallies from roughly $3.00 to just above $7.50 before stalling, even though it remains below the 1.272 weekly extension at $8.29661. Alongside the charts, Charting Guy pushes back against bearish momentum narratives centered on the monthly RSI. He notes that the RSI peak occurred in January 2025 and “lost momentum ALL 2025 while XRP stayed sideways in a range and held its own,” calling this “a very textbook reaccumulation signal where indicators lose steam to reset and price stays stable.” The technical message is unambiguous: as long as the $1.61–1.70 band holds, Charting Guy views XRP’s extended consolidation as preparation, not distribution—anticipating a final flush below $1.70, followed by a Wyckoff-style breakout sequence toward approximately $7.50. At press time, XRP traded at $2.23. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin Just Suffered An 80% Crash In This Major Metric",
    "body": "Dogecoin’s highly anticipated ETF debut has taken an unexpected slow turn. What began as a strong opening for the new GDOG fund quickly faded as inflows collapsed in dramatic fashion. The launch was expected to give Dogecoin a meaningful boost by opening the door for fresh institutional participation. Instead, the opposite has happened, and the Dogecoin ETF has seen its inflows collapse by 80%. Spot Dogecoin ETF Just Suffered An 80% Crash In Inflows The launch of Grayscale Investments’ first-ever spot Dogecoin ETF under the ticker GDOG was hailed as a monumental moment, the first time Dogecoin would be accessible to everyday investors through a traditional brokerage. On November 24, 2025, the product went live on the NYSE Arca, converting Grayscale’s existing DOGE trust into a publicly traded ETF. Related Reading: Pundit Shares XRP Fact That Will ‘Blow Your Mind’ However, just 48 hours after launch, the excitement appears to have cooled down. Although the first day reportedly pulled in roughly $1.8 million in inflows, the second day saw only about $365,420, a collapse of about 80% in early momentum. This has pushed the cumulative net inflows to around $2.16 million, but this is a modest figure for what many expected would be a major catalyst for Dogecoin. Expectations for GDOG were high. Observers pointed to prior early inflow successes with crypto ETFs, notably those for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more recently Solana, which collectively helped push capital inflows at a large scale. To put this into comparison, Spot Solana ETFs, which first went live on October 18, raked in $117.39 million in inflows in the first two days of trading. The recently launched Spot XRP ETFs also saw inflows of $243.05 million on their first day of trading. According to data from SoSoValue, Dogecoin ETF trading volume for the first day was just $1.41 million, far below many projections. The momentum faded even faster on day two, with volume falling by roughly 78% to $397,620. What It Means for DOGE And The Meme-Coin Space The soft start of GDOG raises questions about whether meme coins like DOGE can truly thrive under traditional financial frameworks. On one hand, the ETF listing is a milestone: a token born as a joke is now trading alongside traditional assets on major exchanges. On the other, the weak capital flows hint at limits to demand among institutional investors.

The long-term relevance of DOGE ETFs can only be judged once the market has had time to digest these new products. A successful DOGE ETF could open the door to other meme-coin funds (some suggest even an ETF for Shiba Inu may follow). In addition to Grayscale, other asset managers have Spot Dogecoin ETFs lined up and ready to hit the market. Bitwise launched its Dogecoin ETF on Wednesday following Grayscale’s debut, but early inflow numbers are yet to come in. The asset manager noted they weren’t expecting to launch this product but are only doing so because the DOGE community requested it. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",
