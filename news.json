    "title": "XRP Forecast Turns Explosive As Canadian Experts Highlight Massive FinTech Utility",
    "body": "The latest analysis circulating is that the Canadian fintech analysts are becoming increasingly bullish on XRP, pointing to a surge in real-world utility that could reshape the digital payments landscape. The financial institutions have continued to adopt blockchain-based settlement systems. This growing utility has led several Canadian researchers to issue an explosive new forecast. How XRP’s Real-world Utility Is Expanding Faster Than Market Valuations Canada’s fintech landscape is shifting, and XRP is rapidly emerging as one of its most influential digital assets. According to a video shared by crypto analyst Skipper_xrp, a Canadian news article highlighted that XRP could become the most compelling fintech play in the entire crypto sector and that it could reach as high as $2,000 by 2027. Related Reading: XRP Price About $1,000 Is A Necessity, Analyst Claims It is worth noting that XRP is no longer just a speculative asset in Canada. It’s now being viewed by Canadian analysts and market observers as a tangible fintech tool powering real change in cross-border payment, with a clear path to becoming a cornerstone of modern finance by 2027. The article also predicts that XRP could become the strongest fintech play in crypto. Skipper_xrp added that RACO, which is known as the beloved raccoon-themed token, has quickly become one of the most talked-about projects and is making a splash on the XRP Ledger. While RACO is gaining traction as more users adopt it for transactions, it is emerging as a standout choice within the XRPL ecosystem. Furthermore, the RACO tokens are now officially available for community members to get early access and be part of the project’s growth. Why The Financial Institutions Can Now Offer XRP Access With Confidence In a major regulatory breakthrough of the Ripple Ledger, analyst Skipper_xrp has also stated that the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has confirmed that the national banks are now legally permitted to conduct riskless principal transactions in crypto-assets. This riskless principal activity will open the door for the token to be used in these regulated operations and give banks a compliant way to facilitate XRP-based trades and payments. Related Reading: Here’s Why XRP Positions Itself As Treasury-Grade Rail For Institutions Moving Trillions Furthermore, with the OCC’s confirmation, US national banks can now act as intermediaries for XRP transactions in a fully regulated manner without taking any market risk. This makes it easier for institutional and retail clients to access and use XRP through trusted, regulated financial institutions. According to Skipper_xrp, this ruling provides regulatory clarity and gives XRP a competitive edge in the US market, making it the perfect asset for banks to integrate into their service offerings. Such a move could power increased adoption and liquidity for the asset. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "The Shiba Inu community was jolted by an unexpected surge of whale activity this week, involving a staggering $35 million worth of SHIB. The large-scale whale movement not only caught the community’s attention but also prompted a rare public reaction from Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama. After months of silence, Shytoshi has seemingly resurfaced to acknowledge the massive transfer. Shiba Inu Lead Dev Breaks Silence After Massive Whale Move After over three months of silence, Kusama reappeared on X as the Shiba Inu community reacted to a substantial whale movement. His return followed a repost by World Blockchain Capital about the unusually large transfer of 4,136,208,073,220 SHIB from the crypto exchange Coinbase to a private key wallet. Related Reading: 121 Billion Shiba Inu Coins From Exchanges, Where Are They Headed With Prices Down? World Blockchain Capital tagged several members of the Shiba Inu community in the transaction, urging them to take note and highlighting how rare such a move has been recently. The transaction was first identified by market analyst Del Crxpto, who reported that the more than 4 trillion SHIB transfer was worth about $35 million. Typically, when tokens are removed from exchanges and moved to a private wallet address, it often signals strategic accumulation or long-term holding by major investors rather than immediate trading activity. In this case, the size of the transaction ignited bullish sentiment from market watchers, especially in a period where the price is experiencing significant volatility and choppy action. Excluding the shock of the transfer, what really caught the interest of the community was Kusama’s unexpected reappearance. The lead developer had previously explained in an earlier post that his reduced visibility was due to a shift in focus toward other new projects. At the time, he disclosed a new interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) initiatives aimed at advancing the ecosystem. Kusama emphasized that, despite exploring new directions, he continues to work with SHIB developers, including Kaal Dhairya and others, to shape Shiba Inu’s next phase. Analyst Eyes $0.0002 SHIB As Whales Return A new report by market analyst ‘SHIB Crack’ on X reveals that the price of Shiba Inu is showing signs of a massive breakout amid rising market activity. Currently, the SHIB price is in a downtrend, dropping by more than 6% this week and over 16% in the past month. Related Reading: Will The Shiba Inu Price Hit A New All-Time High In 2025? Machine Learning Algorithm Answers Despite this severe downturn, SHIB Crack believes that the cryptocurrency is gearing up for a massive rise $0.00002. At the time of writing, the meme coin is trading at $0.0000082, meaning a surge to the analyst’s projected target would require a gain of over 142% SHIB Crack has attributed his bullish forecast to the recent sharp surge in whale activity. According to the post on X, SHIB whales have reemerged and are silently accumulating tokens, signaling confidence in the token’s potential to rally.

    "title": "Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher",
    "body": "Dogecoin rose 4% to trade at $0.14 Thursday, according to market reports. Market capitalization was about $21 billion while 24-hour trading volume hovered near $1.6 billion. The move followed renewed on-chain activity that has drawn attention from traders and analysts. Related Reading: Institutions Scoop Up 9,000 Ether, Fueling Bullish Signals Spike In Active Wallets Based on reports from BitInfoCharts, the number of daily active addresses on the Dogecoin network jumped to over 67,500 on December 3, marking the second-highest reading in the past three months. That earlier spike on September 15 came as DOGE briefly approached a local top near $0.30. At that time, network activity rose as prices climbed; today, rising wallet activity is being watched closely as prices test a familiar zone after a long slide. Support Holding Near $0.14 Dogecoin is sitting above an important area around $0.138–$0.14, which has been tested and defended multiple times. Reports show the token has bounced off that level before, and trading volume has more than doubled during the most recent uptick, a sign that buying interest is growing. Market feeds also report mixed short-term figures: one line shows the token down by 5% in a week while another notes a 7.5% decline over the last week; those numbers do not align and highlight some reporting inconsistencies. Longer-term data show the token has lost roughly 60% over the past year and is about 50% off its recent highs. Volume And Technical Targets Traders are eyeing $0.16 as the next meaningful resistance. Based on reports, a decisive move above that zone would be the first clear break in the short-term bearish pattern. Beyond that, the 200-day exponential moving average sits as a broader target, often watched for signals that medium-term momentum has shifted. A break above the 200-day EMA would be treated by many as confirmation that a recovery could gain traction, although history shows these signals sometimes reverse quickly. Signals Are Mixed Daily active address spikes can point to rising interest. They can also reflect simple transfers, bot traffic, or wallet reshuffles by large holders. Increased volume helps the case for buyers, but active-address readings alone are not foolproof. The current setup looks like a battleground: both bulls and bears are more active than they were a few weeks ago. That activity makes the coming days important for traders who favor short-term moves.

    "title": "Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds",
    "body": "As the start-of-week momentum slows, Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped 5.5% on the daily timeframe, falling to the recent lows once again. Some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency is setting the stage for a massive short-term and mid-term rally if the retests of current levels hold. Related Reading: Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin Is ‘Climbing Another Wall Of Worry’– Here’s Why Dogecoin Prepares For $1 Milestone On Thursday, Dogecoin followed the rest of the crypto market and retraced to the $0.136-$0.138 levels. The cryptocurrency has retraced around 50% following the Q4 market downturn, trading within the $0.130-$0.155 price range over the past few weeks. Amid this week’s recovery, DOGE’s price briefly tested the local range highs, trying to break out of this area for the second time this month. However, Wednesday’s volatility, driven by the expectations of the Federal Reserve’s rate cut announcement, led to a 4.6% intraday drop before continuing its descent to the current levels. Market observer Trader Tardigrade highlighted the cryptocurrency’s performance, noting that Dogecoin is holding strong at a key support area despite the pullback, which could “potentially set the stage for a massive surge to $1” next year. According to the chart, DOGE is retesting an ascending support zone that has preceded major moves over the past two years. Since late 2023, this support has been retested three times, marking the bottom of each major corrective phase and serving as a “launchpad” to new highs. Notably, the subsequent rally’s size and duration have seen an increasing trend, with the bounces lasting longer and reaching higher levels after each retest of the two-year trendline. During the first rebound, Dogecoin rallied 87% in eight weeks. Meanwhile, DOGE surged by over 210% in ten weeks after retesting this crucial level. Lastly, it registered a 14-week 442% run between Q3 and Q4, 2024, to its multi-year high of $0.48. With the price currently retesting this level once again, the analyst suggested that a rally to the $1 mark could be brewing if the current levels hold. A bounce from this area could kick off a 610% jump at the start of 2026. DOGE’s Rally To September Highs Imminent? The trader also pointed out that DOGE’s MACD Bullish Crossover “is now happening.” He explained that the cryptocurrency’s trend began shifting from a downtrend to an uptrend on Wednesday, suggesting a significant price move is to follow. He previously affirmed that this setup has preceded previous breakouts this year, with the price surging to new local highs in Q2 and Q3 after each MACD bullish cross. As this setup begins to unfold, the analyst’s chart suggests that the price could bounce to the October levels. Similarly, other market observers hinted that Dogecoin could be preparing for a 60%-120% surge in the short term. Analyst Bitcoinsensus highlighted a classic bullish reversal pattern, a falling wedge pattern, that has been forming since October in DOGE’s chart.

If we get a decent breakout above the upper yellow line, we could be targeting the 0.20$ area (+60%),” the analyst stated. Meanwhile, AltCryptoTalk recently noted that Dogecoin is retesting “the same weekly demand zone that sparked every major rally in the past,” which could spark a 115% rally to the $0.30 September high if the area holds. As of this writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.137, an 8% decline in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Whales Refuse to Sell: Historic Signal Emerges As Binance CDD Drops To 2017 Levels",
    "body": "Bitcoin has retraced below the $91,000 level following the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, a move that initially generated volatility across risk assets. While the market’s reaction has leaned bearish in the short term, on-chain data tells a very different story beneath the surface. Related Reading: The Whale Who Can’t Stop Buying: BitcoinOG Scales Ethereum Long To $280M After Price Surge According to new insights from CryptoQuant, one of the most striking signals comes from the Exchange Inflow Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric on Binance, which has fallen sharply to 380, its lowest reading since September 2017. CDD is one of the most important indicators for understanding long-term holder behavior because it assigns greater weight to older coins that have accumulated more “coin days.” Low values mean that the BTC moving onto exchanges is predominantly from short-term traders, not long-term holders. In other words, veteran holders — the investors who historically move markets — are refusing to sell, even as Bitcoin trades near cycle highs. Long-Term Holders Signal Strong Conviction CryptoOnchain highlights that the significance of this CDD collapse becomes far clearer when viewed against Bitcoin’s current price context. With BTC trading near $89,600, the market is witnessing an unusually large divergence between price action and long-term holder behavior. Historically, when Bitcoin approaches or surpasses all-time highs, long-held coins tend to move — triggering spikes in CDD as early investors and whales take profits. This pattern has repeated across past cycles, making elevated CDD a classic top-signal. But this time, the exact opposite is happening. Instead of old coins entering exchanges, Exchange Inflow CDD is collapsing, indicating that almost none of the BTC being deposited onto Binance comes from long-term wallets. CryptoOnchain explains that this phenomenon strongly suggests that Smart Money and long-term whales have zero interest in selling at these levels, even after a multi-month correction. This refusal to distribute supply removes a major source of overhead resistance and reflects a market dynamic driven increasingly by strong hands. The absence of long-term sell pressure reduces the available liquid supply, often preceding powerful bullish expansions. In simple terms, whales are signaling confidence — not caution — despite short-term volatility, reinforcing the narrative that Bitcoin may be preparing for its next major move. Related Reading: Why Ethereum’s Rally Isn’t Overheated – And Where Demand Must Grow Next Bitcoin Price Action: Testing Support Amid Weak Momentum Bitcoin’s 3-day chart shows the market stabilizing just above the $90,000 level after last week’s sharp post-FED decline. Price remains compressed between the 200-day moving average (red line)—currently acting as primary support—and the 100-day moving average (green line) overhead, which continues to cap upward momentum. This creates a classic squeeze structure where BTC is holding its ground but struggling to reclaim lost trend levels. The recent candle structure highlights a series of higher lows forming near the $89K–$90K region, suggesting buyers are defending this zone as a short-term floor. However, the rejection from the 100-day MA reinforces the broader bearish shift, as BTC remains below both key trend indicators and is yet to reclaim the breakdown level around $100K. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Largest Binance Inflow Since 2023 – Warning Sign? Volume also tells an important story: despite the bounce, buy-side conviction appears weak. The rebound has not been accompanied by a spike in demand, indicating that market participants are cautious following the rate cut and macro uncertainty. If Bitcoin loses the 200-day MA, the next major support lies closer to $84K, which would open the door to a deeper retracement. Conversely, a decisive close above the 100-day MA near $98K would signal momentum returning to the bulls. For now, BTC remains in a fragile consolidation with limited directional strength.

    "body": "Ethereum price started a fresh increase above $3,15 0. ETH is now consolidating and might soon aim for a clear upside break above $3,350. Ethereum started a downside correction from the $3,450 zone. The price is trading above $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,180 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below the $3,150 zone. Ethereum Price Holds Support Ethereum price managed to stay above $3,150 and started a fresh increase, beating Bitcoin . ETH price gained strength for a move above the $3,300 and $3,320 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above $3,400. However, the bears were active below $3,450. A high was formed at $3,448 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below $3,250, and the price even spiked below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,914 swing low to the $3,448 low. However, the bulls were active near $3,150. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . Besides, there is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,180 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If there is another upward move, the price could face resistance near the $3,290 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,320 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,350 level. A clear move above the $3,350 resistance might send the price toward the $3,400 resistance. An upside break above the $3,400 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,450 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,320 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,200 level. The first major support sits near the $3,150 zone. A clear move below the $3,150 support might push the price toward the $3,040 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,020 region. The next key support sits at $3,000.

    "title": "Report Reveals 65% Of Bitcoin Treasury Companies Struggling With Major Unrealized Losses",
    "body": "A recent report from BitcoinTreasuries.Net highlights significant challenges faced by Bitcoin-focused treasury companies since November. The findings revealed that the vast majority of these firms are now grappling with substantial unrealized losses, prompting many to sell off considerable amounts of their Bitcoin holdings. Market Struggles Continue In a sample analysis of 100 companies with reliable cost basis measurements, approximately 65% purchased Bitcoin at prices that now exceed the current market value, leaving a considerable number of these treasuries with substantial unrealized losses. Bitcoin’s market downturn in late November pushed spot prices down towards $90,000, leaving many buyers from 2025 at a financial disadvantage. Related Reading: Bitcoin Outlook Post Fed’s 0.25% Rate Cut: Historical Patterns And Predictions Now, the market’s leading crypto has retraced below this key level on Thursday, even despite the Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut announcement. Among the companies surveyed, about two-thirds are found to be sitting on unrealized losses based on current market values. But despite the volatility in pricing, some of the largest balance sheets continued to acquire Bitcoin. Notably, firms like Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) and Strive significantly contributed to net additions in November, with Strategy accounting for approximately 75% of all monthly purchases following their sell-offs. Mining companies remain steadfast as a cornerstone of public market Bitcoin holdings. In November, they represented about 5% of new additions to the market and around 12% of the total balances held by public companies. Bitcoin Demand Remains Strong Even as Bitcoin treasury stocks have shown softness compared to Bitcoin itself and broader equity benchmarks, many companies still pursued strategies to add BTC to their balance sheets while refining their capital-market approaches. BitcoinTreasury.Net’s analysis indicates that nearly 50 firms have managed to achieve gains of at least 10% over the last 6 to 12 months. Over time, losses have begun to soften for some. Currently, around 140 companies have experienced declines of at least 10% over a 1 to 3 month period, while about 105 companies have seen similar declines year-to-date. However, not all corporate holders opted to weather the storm of price fluctuations. In November alone, at least five companies decided to sell Bitcoin, with Sequans leading the charge by offloading roughly one-third of its holdings. Related Reading: Strategy Calls For Withdrawal Of MSCI’s Exclusion Plan For Digital Asset Treasury Companies Looking forward, the fourth quarter of 2025 is expected to close with about 40,000 BTC added to public company balance sheets. This figure is notably below the totals from each of the prior four quarters and aligns closely with the additions seen in the third quarter of 2024. The report concluded that despite a clear easing in the “summer buying frenzy,” demand for Bitcoin has not entirely diminished as public corporations are adapting to a more cautious and selective approach as they reassess their recent purchases. At the time of writing, BTC traded at $89,920, down over 2% in the previous 24 hours. This places the cryptocurrency 27% behind its all-time high of $126,000 set in October of this year.

XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.050 zone. The price is now trading below $2.050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.040 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below $2.00. XRP Price Struggles Near Resistance XRP price attempted a recovery wave above $2.150 but failed to continue higher, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price started a fresh decline below $2.080 and $2.050. There was a move below the $2.00 support level. A low was formed at $1.993, and the price recently started an upside correction. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.177 swing high to the $1.993 low. However, the bears are active near $2.040 and $2.050. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.040 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.040 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.080 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.177 swing high to the $1.993 low. A close above $2.080 could send the price to $2.012. The next hurdle sits at $2.150. A clear move above the $2.150 resistance might send the price toward the $2.1850 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.220 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.250. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.040 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.00 level. The next major support is near the $1.9880 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.9880 level, the price might continue to decline toward $1.920. The next major support sits near the $1.880 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.820. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

    "title": "Stellar (XLM) Forms Signal That Last Led To 95% Price Rally",
    "body": "A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how Stellar has just seen a TD Sequential buy signal. Here’s what happened the last time the pattern surfaced. Stellar Shot Up The Last Time A TD Buy Signal Appeared At Current Prices In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential signal that has appeared in the 1-week price of Stellar. The TD Sequential is a technical analysis (TA) indicator that’s used for pinpointing locations of probable reversal in an asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Lacks Fresh Momentum As Realized Cap Growth Still Declining The indicator involves two phases. In both of them, it works by counting up candles of the same polarity (that is, whether red or green) in the asset’s chart. These candles don’t have to be consecutive. During the first phase, called the setup, this count runs until nine candles of a color are in. Once the indicator finishes the setup, the price can be assumed to have reached a potential point of turnaround. Naturally, this signal is a bullish one if the candles leading up to the setup’s completion were red. On the other hand, it’s bearish in the case of nine green candles. As soon as the setup is over, the second phase, known as the countdown, kicks off. In this phase, the candle count runs until 13. After the countdown is over, the asset could be considered to have arrived at another reversal. The TD Sequential has just completed the former of the two phases for Stellar. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows this pattern forming in the weekly XLM price. As displayed in the graph, Stellar has formed the latest TD Sequential setup with nine red candles, implying that the downtrend may be reaching a state of exhaustion and a bullish reversal could be due for the asset. Interestingly, this isn’t the first time that XLM has shown a TD Sequential buy signal at the current price levels during the last few months. From the chart, it’s visible that this pattern also emerged when the cryptocurrency was trading at similar levels in March. That setup in the indicator eventually led to a price surge of 95% for Stellar. Given this trend, it’s possible that the latest signal could also prove to be bullish for XLM. Related Reading: Solana Enters Bear Territory: Realized Loss Now Outweighs Profit Something to note, however, is that the TD Sequential setup didn’t immediately lead into the big price rally back then; it took a while of consolidation before the breakout appeared. It now remains to be seen whether the indicator will hold for Stellar this time, and if so, how long a rally will take to appear. XLM Price At the time of writing, Stellar is trading around $0.243, down more than 4% over the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, charts from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Crypto Market Dips: The Reasons Behind Bitcoin Plunge Below $90,000 Despite FOMC Optimism",
    "body": "On Thursday, Bitcoin (BTC) once again fell below the critical $90,000 mark, even after what many had anticipated to be a bullish event stemming from the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) decision to cut rates by a quarter point. Analysts from Bull Theory note several factors contributing to this unexpected downturn. Bitcoin Sell-Off Amid Market Unease The analysts pointed out that the rate cut itself was largely anticipated by investors weeks prior, with a 95% probability already priced into the market. Ahead of the announcement, they identified that many positioned themselves in expectation of some form of liquidity support from the Fed, leading to a rally in Bitcoin prices. However, when the actual cut and the accompanying plan for $40 billion in monthly T-bill purchases were confirmed, many of these “whales”—large investors in the market—began to take profits. Related Reading: Strategy Calls For Withdrawal Of MSCI’s Exclusion Plan For Digital Asset Treasury Companies Adding to the market’s unease was Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post-announcement press conference, where he highlighted persistent weaknesses in the labor market and ongoing inflation concerns. Furthermore, the Fed’s dot plot projections indicated the likelihood of only one additional rate cut in 2026. The situation was compounded by disappointing earnings results from Oracle, which reported its second quarter’s financials after the market’s close. The tech giant missed its adjusted revenue estimates, and higher capital expenditure projections led the stock to plunge by more than 11% in after-hours trading. This drop also negatively impacted US stock futures, as concerns grew that the artificial intelligence (AI) boom may be peaking. The widespread fear from Oracle’s results quickly spread from equities into the cryptocurrency space. Ultimately, all three factors converged to create a significant sell-off: the rate cut was already factored into the market, liquidity trades had been preemptively enacted, and Powell’s remarks did not provide the strong easing signal that some traders had hoped for. Positive Liquidity Conditions Expected In 2026 Interestingly, Bull Theory analysts assert that the crypto market’s recent decline is not indicative of a fundamental shift towards bearish conditions but rather an overreaction based on high expectations leading up to the Fed’s announcement. The Fed has now enacted rate cuts three times in as many meetings, and their plans to purchase $40 billion in T-bills over the next month are designed to inject liquidity into the markets. Moreover, Powell indicated that further rate hikes are not on the horizon as a base case, and forecasts for solid economic growth next year remain intact.

The current market movements illustrate that the dumping of assets was largely driven by overly optimistic expectations rather than any deterioration in underlying fundamentals. Looking ahead, the analysts believe that next year is expected to be more favorable for Bitcoin and broader crypto prices in terms of liquidity, contrasting sharply with the conditions projected for 2025. Bitcoin recovered above $91,100 as of this writing, amid rising volatility. This puts the top cryptocurrency 26% behind its all-time high of $126,000, set in October of this year.

    "body": "Anthony Scaramucci showed up to Solana Breakpoint in Abu Dhabi wearing a tie — a small act of rebellion in a sea of hoodies — and then proceeded to make a much bigger one on stage: Solana is going to “flip” Ethereum. Scaramucci’s Solana Prediction Not in the Twitter-war, zero-sum, “ETH is dead” kind of way. More like: same league, different growth curve, and Solana ends up with the bigger market cap. “I think it will flip Ethereum, but that doesn’t mean Ethereum’s going down or anything like that. I think there’s going to be market share for Ethereum. I think they could both grow, but I think from a market capitalization perspective, I think Solana will end up growing faster,” Scaramucci told CoinDesk Live on Dec. 11. That’s been his line for a while. This time it came with a prop: his new book, Solana Rising, which dropped Dec. 9 and — according to Scaramucci — quickly hit the top of Amazon’s “new releases” list for investment management/investment strategy. He framed the book as something for the skeptics, or at least for the friends of the believers. Related Reading: Solana Enters Bear Territory: Realized Loss Now Outweighs Profit The pitch is familiar if you’ve been anywhere near crypto conferences this year, but Scaramucci’s version is unusually blunt: Solana is the fastest-growing chain, it’s stacked with activity, it’s cheap to use, and it’s easy to build on. Then you add staking, and you’ve got what he keeps calling “great tokenomics.” And yes, he’s heavily aligned. “Full disclosure,” he said, “I have a large personal holding in Solana. I have it on the firm’s balance sheet.” How large? On SkyBridge’s balance sheet, he put it at “probably 60%,” with the firm sitting on “north of a nine figure balance sheet.” His personal portfolio allocation, he estimated, is around “6% 7%.” Big, but not “I sold the house for SOL” big. Notably, Scaramucci emphasized that he’s not “chain monogamous.” He likes Avalanche. He likes Ethereum. He’s not doing maximalism. He’s doing a portfolio. “In fact, who is chain monogamous?” he joked. Related Reading: Solana Hits Critical Demand Zone — Is A Surprise Bottom Loading? The Skybridge Capital founder added: “It’s not an amorous thing. It just has to do with the realities of investing. It’s like owning a lot of stocks in your portfolio. But to me, I just think that it is the fastest growing chain. That’s the most activity of like the top 50 chains combined. It’s got lots of use cases, lots of versatility. It’s easy to develop on and it’s very low fees to transact on and it’s got great tokenomics if you want to stake your Solana like I do.” He also pointed to the debut of the first spot Solana ETF in the United States — “first staking ETF,” in his words — as another signal that we’re still early. Then came the price talk, because of course it did. Could SOL hit $300–$400 by the end of next year? “Sure,” he said, tying it to a more constructive US regulatory backdrop — specifically his hope that the CLARITY Act gets passed and unlocks “the full utilization of tokenization.” Longer term, he went bigger: “Is Solana go to $1,000 over the next five years? I really do believe that.” He also revisited Bitcoin. Same vibe: right call, wrong calendar. “I’ve been right about Bitcoin, but I’ve been wrong about timing,” Scaramucci said, sticking with a $150,000–$200,000 target, and arguing a friendlier rate environment next year could help. At press time, SOL traded at $139.14. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Do Kwon, the South Korean co-founder of Terraform Labs, was sentenced to 15 years in prison on December 11, 2025 in a Manhattan federal court after pleading guilty to fraud tied to the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin and its sister token, Luna. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher According to court documents and news reports, the judge described the scheme as a massive fraud that left thousands of investors facing heavy losses. Sentence And Court Ruling Judge Paul A. Engelmayer handed down the 15-year term after prosecutors urged for a sentence of up to 12 years and the defense asked for a much lighter term. Do Kwon pleaded guilty in August 2025 to conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud, and as part of the plea he agreed to forfeit roughly $19 million. The US Attorney’s office says the guilty plea admits he misled investors about how the stablecoin kept its $1 peg. Scale Of The Losses Reports have placed the market fallout from the Terra collapse at about $40 billion in erased value. Many ordinary investors lost life savings and some victims gave emotional testimony at sentencing, describing real financial ruin. News outlets and court filings tie the crash in May 2022 to a sudden loss of confidence that cascaded through markets and hurt other crypto firms. Civil Penalties And Settlements Before the criminal case reached this point, Kwon and Terraform faced a major civil action from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the SEC, Terraform Labs and Kwon agreed to pay more than $4.5 billion in disgorgement, interest and penalties, while Kwon personally faced an $80 million civil fine and a ban from crypto trading. That civil judgment was filed in 2024 and has been used by regulators as part of the overall effort to make investors whole. International Arrest And Extradition Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 after leaving Singapore; authorities say he was using forged travel documents when detained. He fought extradition in Montenegrin courts but was eventually transferred to the US late in 2024 to face federal charges. Reports outline a long legal fight across borders that ended with his return to New York to answer criminal counts. Related Reading: American Bitcoin Makes Big Buy, Adds 416 BTC To Its Stack What The Sentence Means Legal analysts say a 15-year term signals the court’s view that the fraud caused wide damage and that punishment should deter similar schemes. Victims’ statements at sentencing appear to have weighed heavily. Kwon still faces separate probes and possible charges in other countries, and the civil judgment means substantial sums are earmarked for recovery efforts tied to Terraform’s bankruptcy.

    "body": "Crypto pundit NoLimit has explained why the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices have been dumping recently. He specifically raised claims of manipulation, with these crypto prices recording gains and then fully retracing those gains. In an X post, No Limit stated that the Bitcoin price is dumping because Binance is buying and that Coinbase is dumping a large amount of BTC. The Bitcoin decline has also sparked declines for the Ethereum and Dogecoin prices, which are known to mirror the flagship crypto. Meanwhile, the crypto pundit raised claims of BTC being manipulated. Pundit Explains What Is Happening With The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices NoLimit pointed out something weird that happened on the order books, noting a massive spike in Binance’s CVD, which didn’t come from retail suddenly buying millions of dollars in BTC. On the other hand, he stated that Coinbase’s CVD fell at the exact same time, indicating that the crypto exchange dumped some BTC, which sparked declines in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Can Hit These ‘Realistic’ Bullish Targets Before The Bear Market Begins The crypto pundit highlighted the sharp decline in Bitcoin’s price as liquidity was yanked, creating a thin order book. He further remarked that one venue is getting aggressively bid up while the other is getting drained. NoLimit explained that this is not a normal spot flow and that it is likely coordinated positioning, hedging, arbitrage, or pure manipulation. NoLimited pointed out that the Bitcoin price reacted instantly to this alleged manipulation, dropping, then pushing to $94,000, and then dropping again. This also dragged down the Ethereum and Dogecoin prices. The crypto pundit asserted that a group of people is playing with the market and that most people won’t notice until it is too late. He stated that when crypto exchanges completely disagree on net flow like this, it is usually a warning. NoLimit added that the next big move is being set up before the public catches on. The crypto pundit urged market participants to pay attention because things are about to get interesting. Another Pundit Raises Manipulation Claims Crypto pundit Vivek also indicated that the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices may be manipulated at the moment. He noted that BTC round-tripped from $94,000 to $88,000 three times in the last few days, liquidating both longs and shorts worth over $200 million. The pundit added that this is an example of clear market manipulation to wipe out both leveraged longs and shorts. Related Reading: When Will Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Go Into A Bear Market?

    "title": "Why This Market Analyst Is Warning Crypto Investors To Stop Buying XRP",
    "body": "The XRP price could be on the verge of a massive crash, as a crypto analyst has identified a key technical pattern in the cryptocurrency’s structure that signals a potentially severe downturn. According to the analyst, this formation has appeared only twice in XRP’s history, and each time has preceded a devastating loss. If the pattern were to repeat, the cryptocurrency could be headed for more pain. The analyst warns traders and investors to stop buying XRP at this time, citing heightened risk. Analyst Advices Against Buying XRP As Price Crash Looms An urgent warning from market analyst Steph is Crypto has spread across the community, as he advises traders and investors to “not touch XRP anymore.” The analyst shared a video of his XRP price forecast on a recent X post, revealing that the altcoin’s long-term indicators point to a troubling setup that could mirror downturns observed during past market cycles. Related Reading: Why Now Is The Perfect Opportunity To Short Bitcoin Down To $40,000 Steph Is Crypto shared that his study of the monthly Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for XRP has revealed a new bearish crossover taking shape, signaling declining momentum. The analyst stated that XRP had formed a bearish crossover on the chart only twice since its inception in 2012. Both times this pattern appeared, the cryptocurrency underwent one of the most dramatic price crashes ever, losing over half its value right after. He explained that during the first bearish crossover in 2019, XRP crashed by more than 84%. Similarly, a second crossover reemerged in 2022, triggering a deep price decline of about 67%. It’s worth highlighting that each time XRP formed this bearish signal, it was after a major bull market. In 2018, the cryptocurrency staged a historic rally that sent its price to its current all-time high above $3.84. Likewise, the steep correction in 2022 came on the heels of an explosive 2021 bull market, one of the most powerful in crypto’s history. Just as in the past, Steph Is Crypto sees a bearish crossover forming once again in the current cycle, suggesting that the conditions are aligning for another devastating price crash. He admitted that he wishes he had not spotted this formation on XRP’s chart, underscoring his usually bullish stance on the cryptocurrency. The analyst has cautioned traders to take this historical setup seriously and to consider the possibility that XRP could revisit significantly lower price ranges if the pattern plays out. XRP Price Momentum Remains Weak XRP remains in a downward trend, with its price barely holding above $2.00. The cryptocurrency has dropped by over 15% so far this month, declined about 2.2% over the past week, and has crashed approximately 16% year to date, according to CoinMarketCap. Related Reading: Here’s Why Strategy’s $1 Billion Bitcoin Purchase Did Not Trigger A Price Rally XRP’s price momentum is weak, with little indication of a near-term recovery. The cryptocurrency’s Fear and Greed Index has slipped to 42, edging closer to the “fear” zone. This market uncertainty is being driven by the cryptocurrency’s sluggish price action, despite having passed $3.00 earlier this year and nearly challenging its all-time high.

    "title": "Silk Road Bitcoins Are On The Move Again, Is The BTC Price Ready For Another Dump?",
    "body": "After nearly five years of dormancy, a cluster of Silk Road–linked wallets just moved 33.7 Bitcoin—roughly $3 million—in a sudden on-chain resurgence that immediately brought the BTC price back into focus. While the volume is modest, the combination of its origin, timing, and institutional destination gives it an outsized narrative impact. With Bitcoin already navigating a fragile price range, this development raises concerns about renewed downward pressure. The 33.7 BTC Silk Road BTC Transfer And Its Potential Impact On Bitcoin’s Price The movement began with a series of small outputs originating from early-era Silk Road addresses, all using the old “1…” legacy format. These wallets had last shown activity on February 2, 2021, before abruptly pushing out 176 tiny transactions that were subsequently consolidated into the bech32 address bc1qnysx9sr0s7uw39awr3hh099d5m0lvrnxz7ga54. Roughly a day later, that entire 33.7 BTC was moved again through an intermediary hop and then flagged by chain-analysis dashboards as a Coinbase Prime deposit. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Set To Surge As Sellers Show Signs Of Exhaustion The first alert about the movement came from the X account DarkWebInformer, which spotted the burst of micro-transactions. Even after this transfer, about 416 BTC—roughly $37.5 million—remains untouched in the wider group of connected addresses. This supports the idea that the 33.7 BTC shift was simply a dust-sweep or cleanup action, not a full-scale release of seized holdings. With the operational picture clear, the focus shifts to the price impact. In terms of liquidity, 33.7 BTC is far too small to trigger a market-wide dump. What matters more is the psychological effect. Bitcoin is already trading in a corrective range, and activity linked to Silk Road history can make traders cautious. Although the Coinbase Prime routing points to OTC or custodial handling rather than a spot-market sale, the optics alone can tighten risk models and stoke volatility in the BTC price. Dormant Wallets And Market Sensitivity Dormant Silk Road wallets have a history of resurfacing. In May 2025, two such wallets moved over 3,400 BTC—worth roughly $322 million—after nearly a decade of inactivity. The funds were transferred into new addresses rather than exchanges, showing that these movements do not automatically trigger selling and are more notable for their on-chain and narrative significance than for their impact on liquidity. Related Reading: Pundit Highlights The Condition That Will Trigger A 2,300% XRP Rally To $50 While these transfers have little direct effect on liquidity, Bitcoin’s current price action makes the market more sensitive to any headline. After approaching $94,000 earlier this month, BTC slipped back to $90,000–$92,000. On X, bearish analysts have highlighted a continuation pattern, with some projecting potential downside toward $88,000 – $89,000. This environment primes traders to react strongly to even minor negative catalysts, including long-dormant wallet activity. Overall, the recent Silk Road transfer is unlikely to trigger a standalone dump. The main pressure stems from Bitcoin’s fragile technical posture, making even small but symbolically significant moves capable of increasing short-term volatility.

    "title": "Fed Cut Lights The Fuse: Bitcoin Rebounds And Bulls Predict More Upside",
    "body": "Crypto markets saw a modest lift after the US Federal Reserve made another move on rates, and traders are watching for a clearer follow-through. According to reports, the Fed has carried out three consecutive interest rate cuts totaling 0.75% from September to December. The move was widely expected. Still, market responses have been mixed and somewhat choppy. Related Reading: American Bitcoin Makes Big Buy, Adds 416 BTC To Its Stack Fed Moves And Market Takeaway According to CoinEx chief analyst Jeff Ko, much of the Fed’s action was already priced in, and the updated dot plot leaned a bit more hawkish than some had hoped. Ko pointed to $40 billion in short-term Treasury purchases as a technical step to ease liquidity and lower short-term rates, not as a broad stimulus program. Markets took the measures as mildly positive. US stocks rose, and that helped Bitcoin find some footing after an early dip. Santiment And The Short-Term Reaction Based on reports from onchain analytics firm Santiment, each cut has prompted a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” move where initial optimism is followed by short selling. 🇺🇸 The US Fed made three strategic cuts over the past 3 months, resulting in a total of an 0.75% reduction to interest rates. 1⃣ September 17, 2025: Fed lowered the target range to 4.00 %–4.25 % (from 4.25 %+) at the 16–17 Sep meeting. 2⃣ October 29, 2025: Fed cut the rate to… pic.twitter.com/X6DWypvq5t — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 11, 2025 Cuts are seen as bullish for crypto over the long haul, yet they have triggered brief pullbacks in practice. Santiment adds that a small wave of FUD or retail selling often signals that the mild post-cut downswing is finished and a bounce may follow once things calm down. Technical Levels Traders Are Watching Bitcoin was volatile in the aftermath. It fell under $90,000 then popped to $93,500 on Coinbase before settling near $92,300 at the time of reporting. Key resistance sits between $97,000 and $108,000. On the daily chart, BTC remains inside a small rising channel that sits within a larger downtrend, and technical traders note that a MACD histogram is approaching a positive crossover — a sign some see as possible renewed momentum. ETF activity has been tepid, with only $219 million in net inflows since late November, which keeps some investors cautious. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher Dollar Weakness And Equity Signals A weaker dollar has been part of the backdrop; the DXY index fell to 98.36 and is showing bearish momentum on its own MACD. Nasdaq’s move back above its 50-, 100- and 200-day simple moving averages helped lift risk assets briefly, and that has supported Bitcoin’s rebound attempts. Yet correlation with equities remains uneven — losses in stocks tend to hit Bitcoin harder than gains help it, creating an asymmetric risk profile for traders.
