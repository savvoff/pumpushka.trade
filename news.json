    "title": "Whale Inflows Dampen XRP ETF Optimism As Selling Pressure Persists",
    "body": "Expectations around XRP exchange-traded funds were seen as a turning point that could unlock new institutional demand and change XRP’s price structure in favor of buyers. However, recent on-chain data suggests the price response has diverged immensely from that narrative. Metrics tracked by the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant point to a very different dynamic unfolding beneath the surface, one that explains why the altcoin continues to struggle for traction despite headline optimism and inflows into Spot XRP ETFs. Related Reading: Banks Could Favor A Higher XRP Price, Finance Expert Says Whale Exchange Inflows Expose Supply Pressure Data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant reveals an interesting trend among XRP whale addresses and their activity on crypto exchange Binance. A closer look at the Binance Inflow-Value Band chart shows that recent XRP deposits to exchanges are overwhelmingly concentrated in the 100,000 to 1 million XRP range and transactions exceeding 1 million coins. These are not retail-sized movements. They reflect activity from large holders moving significant balances onto exchanges, and this behavior aligns with distribution or preparation for selling. The chart showing the exchange inflow into Binance makes this pattern clear, with repeated inflow spikes driven almost entirely by these higher-value bands, while smaller transaction sizes are comparatively lower. The chart image below shows inflows in chunks between 100,000 XRP and 1 million XRP in purple and inflows of chunks more than 1 million XRP in light blue. Most of the inflows into Binance in the past few days have been characterized by these two cohorts, with a few instances of inflows in chunks between 10,000 XRP and 100,000 XRP. XRP Ledger: Exchange Inflow Value Bands – Binance. Source: CryptoQuant This imbalance means that supply is being added to the market by whales at a pace that smaller buyers cannot absorb, and this is why inflows into Spot XRP ETFs have failed to have a positive effect on the altcoin’s price action. Lower Highs, Lower Lows Confirm Supply Overpowering Demand As shown in the price action overlaid in the chart above, the coin printed repeatedly lower highs and lower lows after major exchange deposits. This happens because of the relatively low numbers of new spot buyers on Binance, and even moderate selling pressure has been enough to cap rallies. As it stands, the crypto is facing selling pressure every time it approaches $1.95. Based on the intensity of exchange inflows and the market’s reaction, the first meaningful support zone is between $1.82 and $1.87. However, if large inflows persist, the data suggests the XRP price could continue declining to the $1.50 to $1.66 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Feels The Weight Of Quantum Risk Concerns, Industry Leaders Warn The interpretation is that the ETF trend did not translate into sustained spot demand for XRP. Instead, whales who accumulated XRP ahead of ETF approval expectations appear to have used the resulting attention as an opportunity to dump their holdings. That said, inflows into Spot XRP ETFs may have helped limit deeper downside, as data from SoSoValue shows these funds recorded $82.04 million in inflows over the recent week.

    "body": "Ethereum price started a recovery wave above $2,95 0. ETH is now consolidating and might soon attempt another recovery wave if it clears $3,050. Ethereum started a decent upward move above the $2,950 zone. The price is trading above $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $2,920 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above the $3,050 zone. Ethereum Price Eyes More Gains Ethereum price started a decent increase from $2,775, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to surpass the $2,850 and $2,880 resistance levels to enter a positive zone. The bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,175 swing high to the $2,775 low. Moreover, there was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $2,920 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . If there is another upward move, the price could face resistance near the $3,020 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,175 swing high to the $2,775 low. The next key resistance is near the $3,050 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,080 level. A clear move above the $3,080 resistance might send the price toward the $3,150 resistance. An upside break above the $3,150 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,220 resistance zone or even $3,250 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,050 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,950 level. The first major support sits near the $2,915 zone. A clear move below the $2,915 support might push the price toward the $2,880 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,840 region. The next key support sits at $2,800. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone. Major Support Level – $2,915 Major Resistance Level – $3,050",

That view sits alongside data points and trader commentary that recall past big drops after sharp peaks. Cycle Warning From Fidelity According to Timmer, Bitcoin’s price history follows a roughly four-year rhythm tied to halvings. Past peaks have been followed by steep corrections of about 70 to 85%. For example, after a high of $1,137 in 2013 the price slipped to roughly $230, and the 2017 peak near $14,050 later traded down toward $3,415. Prices surged again after 2021, and that pattern of parabolic advance then sharp retreat has been repeated. Some traders say those falls are tests of patience rather than a sign the story is broken. Fidelity Warns: #Bitcoin Cycle Peak May Already Be In Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer believes the $126K October high was the top for this cycle. Based on $BTC 4-year halving pattern, He expects 2026 to be a down year, with support around $65K–$75K. Short-Term Pain, Long-Term… pic.twitter.com/t9wNeF5lTo — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) December 21, 2025 Historical Charts Show Parabolic Moves Reports have disclosed that long-term log charts help put these swings in perspective by showing percentage growth across cycles, which can make big-dollar moves easier to read. Market action often looks like a rapid climb to a peak, a quick drop, and a long period where prices move sideways and gains feel slow. Those sideways stretches are where many long-term holders are rewarded, though it can take years. BTC will hit $250k by year-end 2027. 2026 is too chaotic to predict, though Bitcoin making new all-time highs in 2026 is still possible. Options markets are currently pricing about equal odds of $70k or $130k for month-end June 2026, and equal odds of $50k or $250k by year-end… — Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) December 21, 2025 Galaxy Research has flagged overlapping macro and market risks that make forecasting harder for 2026, and options and volatility trends suggest Bitcoin is behaving more like a macro asset than a pure growth gamble. Galaxy Research is still bullish on a multi-year view and projects a path toward $250,000 by the end of 2027. First Quarter Patterns May Matter Related Reading: Before You Sell Bitcoin For Gold, Hear This Warning Based on reports from traders, the first quarter has in past cycles been a period that often supports price stability, although recent years have shown less regularity. Large inflows and treasury buys that could arrive in 2025 might be offset by early-cycle selling from big holders. The balance between institutional demand and whale supply will likely show itself in the first half of 2026, making that stretch important for whether historical four-year rhythms hold firm.

    "title": "Fundstrat Predicts Ethereum Drop To $1,800 In H1 2026",
    "body": "A screenshot attributed to Fundstrat Research is stirring debate over whether Tom Lee’s firm is projecting a sharp first-half 2026 correction in crypto markets—despite Lee’s recent public bullishness on Ethereum. Wu Blockchain shared the image via X, describing it as an internal client note titled “2026 Crypto Outlook: Near-Term Headwinds, Second-Half Upside,” timestamped Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025 at 7:34 p.m. ET. Fundstrat’s Bearish Call Vs. Tom Lee’s Bull Case The document is credited to Sean Farrell, Fundstrat’s head of digital asset strategy, and includes a base-case scenario calling for a “meaningful drawdown in 1H 2026,” with target ranges of bitcoin at $60,000–$65,000, ether at $1,800–$2,000, and solana at $50–$75. The note adds that those levels would represent “attractive opportunities into year-end,” and that if the view is wrong, the preference is still to “play defense” until strength is confirmed. The ETH range is what set the market chatter off. Ether is trading around the $3,000 area, making $1,800 a material downside scenario if taken at face value. Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Record Over $600M In Outflows — Warning Signal For Traders? The controversy, such as it is, comes from the proximity to Lee’s own messaging. At Binance Blockchain Week, Lee said ethereum at roughly $3,000 looked “severely undervalued,” a stance that reads very differently than a research framework explicitly mapping a potential move to the high-$1,000s. Over the past few weeks, Lee even publicly shared his predictions that ETH could reach $20,000 next year and $62,000 over the next several years. Farrell responded directly on X on Dec. 20, arguing the framing of “internal conflict” misunderstands how Fundstrat operates. The firm, he said, houses several analysts with independent processes, each designed for different client objectives and time horizons. Lee’s work, Farrell wrote, is aimed at large institutions that might allocate 1%–5% to BTC and ETH and is structured around longer-term macro and “secular” trends. Farrell’s research, by contrast, is positioned for investors with heavier crypto exposure—he referenced portfolios with ~20%+ allocations—where active risk management and rebalancing matter more than maintaining a single long-duration thesis through volatility. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Outflows Soar To $978M: Sign Of Dip Buying? That distinction is central to interpreting the leaked-style targets. Farrell’s public explanation wasn’t “we are bearish,” but rather “we are cautious in the near term.” He said markets appear priced for “near-perfection” while risks remain elevated—citing government shutdown dynamics, trade volatility, uncertainty around AI capex, and a Federal Reserve chair transition, alongside tight high-yield spreads and low cross-asset volatility. He also highlighted mixed flow conditions. In Farrell’s telling, long-term ETF demand could improve as wirehouses onboard, but near-term pressures persist from “OG selling,” miners, fund redemptions, and even the possibility of an MSCI MicroStrategy delisting—an item that stood out because it suggests the risk lens extends beyond spot crypto into the crypto-equity complex that has become a key liquidity and sentiment barometer. Farrell’s stated base case: “an early-year bounce followed by another 1H drawdown, creating a more attractive opportunity into year-end.If I’m wrong, I’d rather wait for confirmation (trend breaks, flows, momentum, or a clear catalyst). Crypto is reflexive, and for my objective, patience matters in no-man’s land.” The thread ends on a point many readers missed in the initial screenshot-driven outrage cycle: Farrell still expects BTC and ETH to “challenge new ATHs by year-end,” describing a shorter, shallower bear that could compress the traditional four-year cycle narrative. “For those who tuned into the outlook: I still expect BTC and ETH to challenge new ATHs by year-end, effectively ending the traditional four-year cycle with a shorter, shallower bear,” he wrote via X. At press time, Ethereum traded at $3,043. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Crypto pundit BarriC has explained why an XRP rally to $1,000 is possible, even though it could mean the altcoin would have a market cap of almost $100 trillion. The pundit also raised the possibility of XRP rallying to as high as $50,000, which he described as “absolutely possible.” Why XRP Could Rally To $1,000 In an X post, BarriC stated that XRP will have to become extremely expensive so that it can be fractionalized and allocated to every bank and financial institution globally. He noted that this will be the case if every bank and financial institution around the world adopts and utilizes the altcoin. Related Reading: XRP Price About $1,000 Is A Necessity, Analyst Claims In line with this, BarriC declared that this is why a $1,000, $10,000, and $50,000 price tag is “absolutely possible” for XRP. The pundit has continued to reiterate that XRP can hit the $1,000 price target despite how ambitious it sounds, considering what the altcoin’s market cap will be. In another X post, he stated that the altcoin could still close out this year at $100 and hit $1,000 early next year. The pundit admitted that quite a few things would have to happen simultaneously, but that anything is possible in crypto. It is worth noting that finance expert Dr. Camila Stevenson recently echoed BarriC’s sentiment that XRP needs to be expensive to be easily adopted by banks for larger volumes. Meanwhile, BarriC is confident that the XRP adoption among banks is already happening. He recently noted that Swiss bank AMINA plans to start utilizing Ripple payments and, by association, XRP. The pundit also alluded to the fact that Ripple is on course to become a Trust bank after the OCC granted it a conditional approval. Other Potential Catalysts For Higher Price Crypto pundit X Finance Bull highlighted a Trump stimulus and XRP ETFs as catalysts that could drive the XRP price higher. He noted that 20% to 28% of U.S. adults now own crypto, equating to 50 to 65 million people with wallets and market impact. The pundit then raised the scenario in which a small percentage of the proposed $2,000 stimulus check flows into XRP. Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Keeps Crashing X Finance Bull declared that this will create billions in demand, hitting an already rising market. The pundit also mentioned that the infrastructure is in place as XRP ETFs keep launching and banks are onboarding. He added that liquidity finds utility, which is why he is confident that a significant amount of global liquidity could flow into the XRP ecosystem, sparking higher prices for the altcoin. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.92, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",
