    "title": "Ethereum Validators Face Multi-Week Wait As Staking Participation Rises",
    "body": "The Ethereum staking ecosystem is showing clear signs of tightening as demand for validators continues to rise. Participants now face a multi-week wait to enter the network. This growing staking queue reflects a structural shift in how ETH is being held and deployed less as a liquid supply and more as long-term productive capital. As more ETH becomes locked in validation, the dynamics of supply, yield, and network security are quietly being reshaped. Why Validator Delays Add Friction To Supply Re-Entry The current state of Ethereum staking highlights a growing problem with predictability. Crypto expert Dave has pointed out on X that the ETH staking entry queue is now showing an estimated wait of 25 days and 4 hours to enter. Previously, the wait time was around 7.55 days, which is a more than threefold increase in wait time over a relatively short period. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Deposits Just Surpassed Withdrawals, Why This Could Send ETH Price Above $4,000 At the same time, the exit queue is reporting a wait time of 14 minutes, which previously sat for 44.25 days, representing a reduction of well over 4,000 times, from weeks to minutes. According to Dave, staking on a blockchain with this level of variance between entry and exit requirements is uncertain. Waiting weeks to enter while exit clears almost instantly makes staking behavior highly state-dependent and unpredictable. This contract is exactly why the expert prefers staking on Cardano, because there is no entry queue. Also, delegation is reflected on-chain immediately, and stake changes are transparent and deterministic. The only delay is a fixed active stake period of two epochs, which is 10 days before delegation changes take effect. This consistency is the difference because there are no dynamic queues, no sudden shifts, and no surprises driven by changing network states. If demand to stake on Cardano increases rapidly, it will make absolutely no difference, because predictability matters especially with monetary investments. Why Throughput Without Context Is Meaningless The headline claim of $8 trillion in stablecoin transfers on Ethereum sounds impressive, but it’s a completely meaningless metric. Crypto analyst DBCrypto noted that a single entity can move $1 billion back and forth between two wallets ten times, creating a sudden $10 billion in volume, but generating zero economic activity. Related Reading: Big Bet On Ethereum: CEO Sees 10X TVL Growth In 2026 This is why banks don’t advertise transfer volume as a growth metric, as volume without context tells nothing about utility or growth. However, crypto continues to elevate these numbers as milestones because big figures pump bags. What’s being measured here is motion and activity, not progress or value. DBCrypto concluded that until the industry stops celebrating vanity metrics, it will continue to confuse noise for signal. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin Rapid Accumulation Suggests Sharp Upward Sweep Is Coming",
    "body": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is rebounding strongly alongside the broader meme coin market, which has experienced a notable uptick in Q1 2026. As sentiment surrounding meme coins continues to improve, a crypto analyst suggests that Dogecoin could be positioning for more gains. The analyst notes that Dogecoin’s rapid accumulation signals the potential for a sharp upward sweep in the near term. Dogecoin Accumulation Signals Upward Sweep Crypto market expert Bitguru recently shared a fresh technical outlook on Dogecoin, highlighting how its price structure has consistently changed after months of corrective movement. According to him, a completed liquidity sweep followed by an extended consolidation phase suggests that the market has reset and may be setting up for a bullish continuation. Related Reading: Catalysts That Suggests The Dogecoin Price Rally Could Continue Bitguru explained that Dogecoin’s chart shows price stability after clearing sell-side liquidity between November and December 2025, which pushed out weak holders and created a base for accumulation. The consolidation that continued into 2026 shows lower volatility and steady base building, two conditions the analyst believes are needed before Dogecoin’s next major price move. The chart also illustrates bullish patterns, such as a rounded H cup formation and a continuation phase in the middle of 2025, which helped establish higher price levels before the broader market pullback. Bitguru added that Dogecoin’s recent move back above the key support near $0.14 suggests accumulation is likely completed, as price now starts to tighten and move upward from its base level. He noted that as long as Dogecoin stays above this reclaimed support, the chances of an upward sweep toward higher supply zones increase. The chart also points to potential gains reaching the highlighted green target area between $0.188 and $0.194, which lines up with past resistance levels that have previously limited price movement during the decline. Area That Could Invalidate Upward Sweep Bitguru’s chart also shows the possibility of a price decline despite the rapid increase in accumulation. The red zone on the chart represents a stop-loss or risk area. If Dogecoin falls below the support area around $0.148, it could initiate a drop toward new lows within this risk zone. Related Reading: The Dogecoin Cycle Fractal That Shows Where The Price Is Headed Next If the meme coin’s price dips below the consolidation zone between $0.146 and $0.148, then the analyst’s bullish setup and potential upward sweep could be invalidated. The chart projects a potential decline to the $0.13-$0.11 range, reflecting a decrease of more than 9% from current levels. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at $0.143, up more than 18% this week, according to CoinMarketCap data. Although the meme coin is showing clear signs of a recovery from former downtrends, its trading volume is still down by more than 30%. Moreover, DOGE’s price has been unexpectedly volatile recently, dropping by 5% over the past 24 hours. Featured image from Pngtree, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "VanEck Predicts Bitcoin Could Reach $2.9 Million In New Long-Term Capital Report",
    "body": "According to an ambitious research study published by asset manager and cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer VanEck, Bitcoin (BTC) could potentially reach a staggering price of $2.9 million per coin by 2050. The insights come from Matthew Sigel, the firm’s Head of Digital Assets Research, and Senior Investment Analyst Patrick Bush, who have employed a valuation framework based on Bitcoin’s role in two primary total addressable markets: as a medium of exchange (MoE) and as a reserve asset for central banks. VanEck Projects 15% CAGR For Bitcoin In their analysis, Sigel and Bush project a 15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from Bitcoin’s current levels, which would position the cryptocurrency as a significant player in the global economy. Related Reading: Did Morgan Stanley Orchestrate Bitcoin October Crash? Analysts Draw Correlations The report outlines two structural shifts that they believe will be pivotal for Bitcoin’s appreciation. The first, dubbed the Settlement Pivot, predicts that by 2050, Bitcoin will be responsible for settling between 5% and 10% of global international trade, as well as 5% of domestic trade transactions. The second crucial aspect, referred to as the Reserve Pivot, connects Bitcoin’s potential growth to waning trust in G7 sovereign debt. As confidence in these currencies diminishes, the authors anticipate that central banks might allocate resources toward Bitcoin as a hedge against fiscal instability. Yet, the VanEck report does not stop at a mere base case; it also explores a more optimistic scenario termed the Bull Case. ‘Hyper-Bitcoinization’ In this scenario, known as “hyper-bitcoinization,” if Bitcoin captures 20% of international trade and 10% of domestic GDP, its value could skyrocket to $53.4 million per coin, representing a major 29% CAGR. Achieving this would require Bitcoin to either equal or surpass gold’s status as a primary global reserve asset, making up nearly 30% of financial assets worldwide. Related Reading: GENIUS Act Key Provisions In Spotlight: XRP Attorney Deaton Alerts To Bankers’ Role For context, the report uses a baseline current price of approximately $88,000 when projecting these values. Interestingly, it incorporates a Bear Case target of $130,000, reflecting a modest 2% CAGR. In terms of correlation, VanEck anticipates that Bitcoin will exhibit low to moderate correlation with global equities, bonds, and gold over various market cycles. Notably, they emphasize a persistent negative correlation with the US Dollar (DXY), reinforcing Bitcoin’s potential role as a hedge against monetary debasement.

    "title": "Bearish Signal Emerges For Ethereum As US Spot Demand Fades",
    "body": "Ethereum has once again failed to hold above a critical resistance zone, retracing from the $3,300 level back toward the $3,100 area. The pullback highlights the market’s ongoing struggle to establish a sustainable recovery, as bullish momentum continues to fade near key technical thresholds. While buyers have managed to prevent a deeper correction for now, the inability to reclaim higher levels has reinforced a cautious tone across the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tests Key Resistance While $4.7B In Sell-Side Liquidity Builds Beyond price action, on-chain data adds an important layer to this weakness. According to data from CryptoQuant, Ethereum’s Coinbase Premium Gap has dropped sharply into negative territory. This metric, often used as a proxy for US institutional demand, reflects the price difference between Coinbase and offshore exchanges. A negative reading suggests that buying interest from US-based investors is lagging behind global activity, reducing the probability of a strong upside continuation. Historically, sustained Ethereum rallies have coincided with a positive Coinbase Premium, signaling consistent institutional accumulation. The current divergence between price attempts to stabilize and weakening US demand creates a structural headwind for bulls. As long as this premium remains negative, reclaiming the $3,300 level becomes increasingly difficult. For now, Ethereum appears trapped in a fragile range, where price stability depends less on aggressive buying and more on the absence of renewed selling pressure. The coming sessions will be decisive in determining whether this consolidation evolves into a recovery or resolves to the downside. Coinbase Premium Weakness Undermines Recovery Attempt A new on-chain signal is reinforcing the cautious outlook for Ethereum as it trades below key resistance. Analysis shared by CryptoQuant and highlighted by CryptoOnchain shows that the Coinbase Premium Gap has deteriorated sharply, reaching its most negative level in nearly a year. The 14-day moving average of the metric has fallen to around -2.3, indicating that ETH prices on Coinbase are trading at a notable discount compared to Binance. This divergence matters because Coinbase activity is often used as a proxy for US institutional demand. When the premium turns deeply negative, it typically signals that buyers in the US spot market are either stepping aside or actively distributing rather than accumulating. That dynamic is unfolding as Ethereum remains capped below the $3,300 resistance zone, following its sharp correction from the October peak near $4,700. The combination of weak price follow-through and declining Coinbase demand creates a bearish divergence. While ETH attempts to stabilize, the lack of institutional participation reduces the probability of a sustained breakout. Historically, strong Ethereum rallies have required a positive Coinbase Premium, reflecting consistent inflows from US-based investors. Until this gap narrows and flips back into positive territory, Ethereum’s upside appears constrained. For now, the data suggests caution is warranted, as the persistence of weak US demand increases the risk that recent consolidation resolves into another leg lower rather than a confirmed recovery. Related Reading: XRP Sees Back-to-Back Liquidation Waves: Binance Absorbs Majority Of Liquidations Ethereum Struggles As Recovery Lacks Confirmation Ethereum’s price action remains fragile after failing to reclaim the $3,300 resistance zone. On the daily chart, ETH is trading near the $3,100–$3,150 area, a level that has acted as a short-term pivot but has not yet attracted strong follow-through from buyers. The broader structure still reflects a corrective phase rather than a confirmed trend reversal. From a technical perspective, ETH remains below its key moving averages. The 50-day moving average is sloping downward and continues to cap upside attempts, while the 100-day and 200-day moving averages sit higher, reinforcing a heavy overhead supply zone between roughly $3,300 and $3,600. Each rally into this region over recent weeks has been met with renewed selling pressure, highlighting persistent distribution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters Accumulation Regime: Market Supported By Seller Exhaustion, Not Buying Surge The sequence of lower highs since the October peak near $4,700 remains intact. Although price has stabilized compared to the sharp November sell-off, the rebound so far resembles consolidation within a bearish structure rather than a new impulsive move. Volume has also moderated during recent advances, suggesting limited conviction behind the bounce. On the downside, the $2,900–$3,000 range stands out as a critical support area. A sustained break below this zone would expose Ethereum to a deeper retracement toward the mid-$2,600s. For bullish momentum to regain credibility, ETH must reclaim $3,300 with strength and hold above the declining moving averages. Until then, the chart argues for caution, with downside risks still present despite short-term stabilization. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Here’s How High The Dogecoin Price Would If It Repeats Previous Parabolic Runs",
    "body": "Dogecoin’s price action has a habit of compressing quietly before going on a massive rally, and the late-2024 rally is one of the clearest examples of that behavior. After spending weeks grinding sideways around $0.10, the meme coin transitioned into a parabolic phase that carried the price to about $0.45 in a matter of two to three months. Now, how high would the Dogecoin price go if it were to repeat that same parabolic structure? How Dogecoin’s Late-2024 Parabolic Run Played Out The 2024 rally began from a base that had formed just above $0.10, right where Dogecoin spent a long time absorbing sell pressure. Once buyers regained control, Dogecoin cleared intermediate resistance around $0.15 and $0.20 with minimal pullbacks, then entered a vertical phase that pushed it through $0.30 and to $0.45. Related Reading: Dogecoin 50% Crash: Q4 Set To End In Red As All Supports Fail The key takeaway from that period is not just the magnitude of the move, but its speed, as Dogecoin delivered a roughly 4.5x increase in a very short time window of less than four weeks. That move unfolded rapidly, with little warning, and was characterized by expanding volume, strong bullish candles on the 4-hour candlestick timeframe, and momentum indicators pressing into overheated territory. As shown in the chart below, this period was characterized by high RSI readings that pushed into the 70 to 80 range. Applying The Same Parabolic Structure Parabolic rallies often catch many investors off guard. Particularly, one of the defining features of Dogecoin’s strongest rallies is that they rarely announce themselves clearly. Since Dogecoin has performed like that before, then it is not out of proportion to expect similar performance, especially considering that it is now back to trading close to the lows that it rebounded from in late 2024. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Price Reach $1 In 2026? Analysts Reveal What To Expect If Dogecoin were to produce a similar percentage expansion from a higher base, the arithmetic would also be straightforward. Using $0.15 as a reference level, a move equivalent to the late-2024 rally would project the price to around $0.60 to $0.67. That scenario assumes the same kind of rally seen previously, where the consolidation finally gives way to a parabolic rally, not a gradual grind higher. In practical terms, a trader holding 1,000 DOGE at $0.15 would have a position valued near $150 at entry, while a move to anywhere between $0.60 and $0.67 would lift that same holding into the $600 to $675 range. These figures do not come with any suggested timeline. Instead, they serve to show how Dogecoin’s past parabolic moves would translate if the same price behavior were applied to current levels. Even under that framework, the projected move is below Dogecoin’s existing all-time high of $0.76. At the same time, separate outlooks are already pointing to a push beyond that peak, with one notable prediction expecting a move to $0.80 very soon.

    "title": "Analyst Predicts Strongest XRP Price Rally In History Is Coming, Here’s Why",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Bird has indicated that the XRP price may be on course to record its greatest rally ever. The analyst alluded to the falling Bitcoin dominance as the reason why the altcoin could surge soon enough, noting how this development has preceded previous XRP rallies. Analyst Predicts Huge XRP Price Rally On The Horizon In an X post, Bird predicted that the XRP price is set to record its strongest rally yet based on the breakdown in Bitcoin’s dominance. This came as he noted that BTC.D dropped hard the last three times when XRP went truly parabolic, in 2018, 2021, and 2024. The 2018 run was when XRP rallied to its previous all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Why XRP Is About To Experience A Legendary Next 3 Months Bird stated that after that first XRP price ATH between 2018 and 2021, the Bitcoin dominance began to trend back up. The BTC.D then backtested the trend and rebuilt strength before eventually rolling over. Once that rollover occurred, XRP went parabolic again in 2021. A similar scenario is said to have played out in 2024, as Bitcoin’s dominance dropped sharply through the trendline, briefly breaking down and triggering the surge. The analyst noted that the move in 2024 didn’t fully commit as Bitcoin’s dominance recovered and the breakdown failed. However, the attempt was enough to send the XRP price flying, reaching all-time highs. Bird reiterated that XRP is sensitive to a breakdown in Bitcoin’s dominance, even temporarily. Now, a similar move could be playing out again, which could send the XRP price to new highs. Bird stated that between 2023 and 2025, the Bitcoin dominance has trended up once more, broke down through the trend, backtested it from underneath, and is now chopping and rolling over. The analyst added that this is the same historical area where XRP has gone parabolic before, but that this time the setup is even bigger. The Altcoin Could Rally To Double Digits The analyst again alluded to the 2024 run. He stated that if a brief uncommitted breakdown in Bitcoin’s dominance was enough to send the XRP price surging, then a confirmed breakdown would be exponentially stronger. In line with this, Bird remarked that the next move is the one that sends XRP into double digits and beyond. Related Reading: Analyst Updates XRP Price Prediction: Why $16 Is Still On The Table Bird stated that the key difference is what comes next, as this next move isn’t just a fake-out or a shallow drop. Instead, it is the one where the Bitcoin dominance finally loses the trend for good and breaks down hard toward the lower boundary, around the 44 to 40% region. He added that when that happens officially, the XRP price doesn’t just run but enters true price discovery. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.14, down almost 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "Bitcoin Remains In A High-Risk Zone As Short-Term Holders Stay Underwater",
    "body": "Bitcoin is struggling to maintain the $90,000 level after a sharp rejection from the $94,000 resistance zone, keeping market sentiment sharply divided. While some analysts argue that BTC is entering a deeper corrective phase, others believe the pullback is a necessary reset before a renewed upside attempt. The current price action reflects this uncertainty, with volatility rising as buyers and sellers battle for short-term control. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tests Key Resistance While $4.7B In Sell-Side Liquidity Builds According to an analysis shared by Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s short-term risk structure remains fragile. His short-term risk chart places BTC below the Short-Term Holder (STH) Cost Basis, currently estimated near $100,200. Price is also trading beneath all major moving averages, including the 128-day, 200-day, and 365-day SMAs, reinforcing the view that the broader structure is still bearish. At current levels around $91,000, Bitcoin sits in a moderate risk zone, positioned between the STH Cost Basis and the -15% downside boundary. This positioning suggests that recent rebounds should be treated cautiously. Until BTC reclaims the STH Cost Basis, upside moves are more likely to represent technical bounces within a downward trend rather than a confirmed reversal. Conversely, a breakdown below the moderate risk boundary would signal rising downside risk and could accelerate selling pressure. As a result, the $90K–$100K range remains a critical battleground for Bitcoin’s next directional move. STH Losses Continue To Cap Bitcoin’s Upside Adler’s analysis also highlights a second critical framework: the chart tracking Bitcoin’s all-time highs alongside euphoria zones and the Short-Term Holder Market Value to Realized Value (STH MVRV) indicator. This metric measures the ratio between Bitcoin’s current market price and the average realized price of coins held by short-term investors, offering a direct view into the profitability—and behavior—of this highly reactive cohort. At present, STH MVRV sits near 0.92, well below its historical mean of roughly 1.09 and decisively under the neutral level of 1.0. In practical terms, this implies that the average short-term holder is holding an unrealized loss of about 8%. Historically, periods where STH MVRV remains below 1.0 have tended to coincide with either capitulation phases or extended consolidation ranges, rather than sustained bullish expansions. The last clear euphoria zone on this chart appeared during the all-time high update in October 2025, underscoring how far current conditions are from a speculative extreme. As long as STH MVRV remains below breakeven, short-term holders are incentivized to sell into rallies as the price approaches their cost basis. This behavior creates persistent overhead supply and reinforces structural resistance near the STH Cost Basis, close to the $100,000 level. Consequently, reclaiming that zone is not just a psychological milestone but a necessary condition for any meaningful regime shift back to a bullish market structure. Related Reading: XRP Sees Back-to-Back Liquidation Waves: Binance Absorbs Majority Of Liquidations Bitcoin Price Recovery Lacks Confirmation Bitcoin’s price action on the daily chart reflects a market still trapped in a fragile recovery attempt after a sharp rejection from higher levels. Following the failed breakout above the $94,000–$95,000 area, BTC experienced a decisive sell-off that pushed the price back toward the $85,000 zone, where buyers stepped in aggressively. This reaction marked a short-term bottom, but the subsequent rebound has so far lacked structural strength. At present, Bitcoin is trading near the $90,000–$91,000 region, a former support that has now turned into a key pivot. Price remains below the 200-day and 365-day moving averages, both of which are sloping downward and acting as dynamic resistance. The 128-day moving average has also capped recent upside attempts, reinforcing the idea that the broader trend remains corrective rather than impulsively bullish. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters Accumulation Regime: Market Supported By Seller Exhaustion, Not Buying Surge From a structure standpoint, the chart shows a sequence of lower highs since the October peak, suggesting that sellers continue to control the macro trend. Volume expanded notably during the November–December sell-off, while the current bounce is unfolding on comparatively lighter participation. This divergence implies that the move higher may be more short-covering driven than supported by strong spot demand. Unless Bitcoin can reclaim and hold above the $94,000–$95,000 resistance zone with increasing volume, the risk of another rejection remains elevated. Failure to do so could reopen the path toward the $85,000 support, where the market would once again be forced to prove its underlying strength.

    "title": "Cardano Nears End Of 2020-Style Correction: Is $5 To $10 Next?",
    "body": "Cardano (ADA) may be nearing the end of a multi-month corrective phase that closely resembles its 2020 setup, according to a new technical analysis video posted Wednesday by crypto analyst Quantum Ascend. The analyst argues that a similar “lower trendline reset” preceded ADA’s prior breakout cycle, and that several weekly indicators are now starting to turn. Cardano’s 2020 Fractal Is Back In a Jan. 7 video shared on X, Quantum Ascend said he is looking at ADA’s weekly chart through a macro, multi-leg corrective framework. “On a macro count for ADA, you’re looking at an A, B, C, D, and right now waiting on an E,” he said, framing the current market structure as the late stage of a broader consolidation rather than a fresh downtrend. That “E” leg matters in their model because it effectively marks the final phase of a wedge-like compression. Quantum Ascend pointed to an upper trendline, Fibonacci levels, and prior work published in a mid-December video to justify upside targets once the structure completes. “Essentially you have upper trendline, you have some Fib stuff in play, I have a conservative of five bucks, primary up there at $10,” he said. “And then after that, I think it gets ugly for crypto for a little while, so still a believer that alt season is ahead of us.” Related Reading: Is Cardano Entering a New Phase? Technical Strength, ETF Watch, and Ecosystem Direction Align The core of the argument, however, wasn’t the targets themselves, it was the claimed resemblance to an earlier Cardano correction. Quantum Ascend overlaid a historical “fractal” to highlight comparable price behavior: a move up to a similar level, a pullback, another push into resistance, and then a wick that tagged roughly the same area on the overlay. “This correction right here that I just took this from, look at how similar it is to that correction that we just had,” he said. “Obviously it’s not perfect, but if you tried to get it close from a price structure standpoint… look where that wick on 10.10 went, exactly right there.” In the analyst’s telling, that prior pattern was the market’s way of forcing ADA down to establish a lower trendline before the next expansion. “So this is the same exact move that Cardano had to come down to set the lower trendline,” he said. “So right now setting the lower trendline, before it went on a blast off.” He then referenced the scale of Cardano’s last major run as a reminder of what altcoin cycles have historically looked like when momentum turns. “And how far did it end up running? Well, it ended up going 170X from that point in time, from a penny all the way up to $3,” Quantum Ascend said, using that move as context for why double-digit targets don’t automatically fall into the “impossible” bucket during late-cycle expansions. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Addresses ADA Dump Rumors, Is He Behind The 80% Price Crash? The more immediate claim is that the upside implied by a $10 target is not unprecedented in percentage terms compared with prior alt cycles. “When you’re looking at how far that $10 mark is from where we’re at right now, I mean 22X, right? 25X,” he said. “What was this alt season back here? This alt season was just 2021… That was a 21X… So it’s not unreasonable to be looking for 24X there. And then even on the conservative side, more of a 12X.” On indicators, Quantum Ascend highlighted early signs of a weekly momentum shift rather than a confirmed breakout. “You have a completed ABC. This thing’s ready to turn back around,” he said, adding that broader market conditions looked supportive of a bounce. The analyst also pointed to the weekly RSI beginning to lift after an extended period near lows. “Look at the RSI here on the weekly, finally starting to curl up off the floor. We’ve been down on the floor since October 27th that week, finally getting a little juice.” The analyst described negative momentum as “been decreasing,” and referenced an “ABC” structure on MACD as another piece of the same turning narrative. “A lot of these major moves happen when the weekly RSI goes from low to high,” Quantum Ascend said, arguing that higher timeframes can be slower but more reliable when they finally rotate. Quantum Ascend closed by saying he remains constructive on the project even without a current position. “I am a big believer in this project. I don’t hold any right now. It’s just the way that my portfolio has worked out,” he said. “But I do believe that there’s going to be some massive upside coming to Cardano.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.3925.

    "title": "$460M Crypto Longs Squeezed As Bitcoin Slips Below $90,000",
    "body": "Data shows the crypto derivatives market has faced a fresh wave of liquidations as Bitcoin and other assets have gone through a retrace. Crypto Market Has Seen Liquidations Of More Than $462 Million According to data from CoinGlass, a notable amount of liquidations have occurred in the crypto derivatives market over the past day. “Liquidation” refers to the forceful closure that any open contract undergoes after it has amassed losses of a certain percentage specified by the platform. Related Reading: CryptoQuant CEO Expects Boring Bitcoin Action, Not Major Crash A mass amount of simultaneous liquidations can occur when the asset’s price observes a sharp price swing, not allowing investors the time to close their positions. The risk of this happening can increase depending on how much leverage traders are opting for. The trigger for the derivatives flush in the past day has been a downward move across tokens in the digital asset sector, which took Bitcoin to a low under $89,600. Below is a table that shows the numbers involved in this liquidation event. In total, the crypto market has witnessed over $462 million in liquidations during the last 24 hours, with longs dominating most of the flush. More specifically, bullish bets made up for $418 million of the positions involved, representing more than 90% of the total. The large amount of liquidations could indicate that the recovery in Bitcoin above $94,000 lured traders into opening fresh longs, which then ended up getting caught out by the price plunge. In terms of the symbols, the largest contributor to the liquidation event has been BTC with $132 million in positions involved, while Ethereum hasn’t been too far behind with a flush of $116 million. Interestingly, while the top two have been predictable, the third place hasn’t been occupied by the usual suspects this time. As the above heatmap displays, contracts related to Zcash (ZEC) have been caught up in liquidations of $24 million. The asset managing higher liquidations than the likes of XRP and Solana could be down to the fact that it has seen a notably sharper drop over the last 24 hours.

Analyst Sees 2022-Style Bear Flag The latest liquidation squeeze has come as the futures market has been witnessing a re-expansion of Open Interest, as highlighted by Glassnode in its latest weekly report. The bearish price action between October and November had caused a massive amount of liquidations and forced traders to pull back on risk, resulting in the Open Interest taking a significant hit. Recently, the metric has seen a turnaround, implying investors have gradually been building up positions again. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $89,500, down 2% over the past day. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin Prepares For Major Recovery As Bullish Momentum Builds – Here’s The Target",
    "body": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is attempting to hold a crucial area as support after recording a 3.2% drop in the daily timeframe. Despite this, an analyst suggests that the leading memecoin is preparing to reclaim a key resistance level lost during the Q4 2025 pullbacks. Related Reading: XRP Named The ‘New Cryptocurrency Darling’ After Strong Start Of The Year Dogecoin Q1 Momentum Builds Dogecoin has seen a remarkable start to the year, recording a 21% jump from its yearly opening price of $0.117. Amid the recent market recovery, the cryptocurrency reclaimed a crucial price area and hit an eight-week high of $0.156 this Tuesday. Notably, the largest memecoin by market capitalization had retraced more than 50% from its Q2 2025 highs and was in a downtrend until last week’s price breakout. Amid this performance, market observer Trader Tardigrade highlighted a pair of Tweezer candlesticks on the monthly chart, which could suggest a bullish reversal is taking place. DOGE “has nearly recovered last month’s losses in just 8 days,” he explained, which signals that “clearly, bullish momentum is building up.” Notably, the analyst recently noted that DOGE has broken out of a bullish pattern, “showing strong upward momentum.” According to the chart, the cryptocurrency displayed a three-month falling wedge in the three-day chart. Following the recent price surge, Dogecoin was able to breach the pattern’s upper boundary, signaling an initial jump to the $0.140-$0.150 area. The trader highlighted that the memecoin displayed a similar performance during his 2024 rally, moving within a multi-month falling wedge before breaking out and kicking off a remarkable performance. If DOGE repeats its previous performance, the price could retrace briefly to retest the breakout area as support before the next major surge, the market watcher added. He also pointed out that after breaking out of the daily trendline, the cryptocurrency appears to be forming a bullish pennant in the one-day chart. A breakout from this pattern would lead to a 40% move toward the $0.20 area, lost during the early Q4 pullbacks. However, DOGE’s price needs to close the day above the $0.142 area to hold the formation. DOGE’s Rally In Danger? Despite the bullish outlooks, analyst Ali Martinez affirmed that Dogecoin is “hanging by a thread.” In a Thursday post, the market watcher emphasized that the cryptocurrency is trading within a crucial support zone between the local lows of $0.118 and the recent highs. If the memecoin’s momentum doesn’t hold and the price loses this key zone, it could risk a more than 40% retrace. According to the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric cited by Martinez, the next major support is around $0.073, where over 28 billion DOGE tokens were previously exchanged. Related Reading: Bitcoin At A Crossroads: $93,500 Reclaim Holds The Key For Next Move The analyst has recently pointed out that cryptocurrency’s price is seemingly on track to retest the $0.08 level after breaking out of a multi-year ascending channel. The chart shows that Dogecoin traded within an ascending channel on the three-day chart since 2023. However, the late 2025 corrections saw the memecoin lose the lower boundary of the ascending channel, potentially painting a concerning picture for its price if long-term bearish momentum continues. As of this writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.142, a 14.55 increase in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $136 and $138 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $138 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $137 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could extend gains if it clears the $142 resistance zone. Solana Price Regains Traction Solana price corrected gains from the $144 zone but remained stable above the $130 zone, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL formed a low near $132 and started a fresh upward move. The price climbed above the $135 level to enter a short-term positive zone. It surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $143 swing high to the $132 low. Besides, there was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $137 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading above $138 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near $140 and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $143 swing high to the $132 low. The next major resistance is near the $142 level. The main resistance could be $145. A successful close above the $145 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $150. Any more gains might send the price toward the $155 level. Another Decline In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $140 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $138 zone. The first major support is near the $135 level. A break below the $135 level might send the price toward the $132 support zone. If there is a close below the $132 support, the price could decline toward the $124 support in the near term.

    "body": "The Bitcoin hash ribbons indicator has recently flipped back to a buy signal on the weekly timeframe, according to a Jan. 8 video analysis from crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev Capital TA). The setup matters, he argued, because the model has historically been associated with higher prices after corrective periods, even if its record is no longer spotless. In the video, Kev Capital walked viewers through the weekly Bitcoin chart with the hash ribbons overlay, describing it as one of the higher “hit rate” signals in crypto’s technical playbook. “There have been 19 buy signals on the weekly time frame throughout all of Bitcoin’s history and it has an 84% hit rate of playing out,” he said, adding that such consistency is rare for any single indicator. Hash ribbons attempt to infer miner stress and recovery by comparing short- and longer-term moving averages of network hash rate. Kev Capital framed it less as a simple “buy/sell” tool and more as a proxy for network health, where miner behavior can precede shifts in market structure. “It’s not just a buy and sell indicator. It’s tracking mining hash rate,” he said. “And what that basically means is it’s tracking the overall power and network health on the Bitcoin blockchain.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Nears Neutral As Price Recovers The mechanics, as he explained them, hinge on the 30-day moving average of hash rate (his chart showed this as a green line) versus the 60-day moving average (a gray line). When the 30-day crosses below the 60-day, the model labels it capitulation, which he described as aligning with bearish price action and a weaker network backdrop. When the 30-day crosses back above the 60-day, the indicator prints a buy signal (shown as blue dots on his chart), which he interprets as miners “rebounding” after weaker operators have been forced out. “Anytime that 30-day crosses below the 60, it marks a capitulation phase, which shows that there’s been bearish price action in a weaker network,” Kev Capital said. “Now, when it crosses back above is when you get the blue dots, and that is a buy signal. That’s when the 30-day moving average of hash rate crosses back above the 60-day moving average of hash rate.” Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Buy Signal Returns The near-term catalyst for his update was a fresh signal sequence around the end of December. Kev Capital said the hash ribbons flashed capitulation in the second-to-last week of December, followed by a buy signal in the last week of December. He noted the indicator was again “flashing a capitulation signal” during the current week, not yet confirmed which could set up another buy signal if the moving averages continue to “mingle” and then resolve higher.

While he cited an 84% historical hit rate for the weekly buy signals, he said that earlier in the current cycle the indicator printed two buy signals: in May and July that did not deliver the kind of follow-through that has defined prior successful instances. “We did go up from the original buy signal, but it really wasn’t a lot,” he said, contrasting that with prior hash ribbons episodes that “typically produce a 30 to 100% move.” In his telling, those underwhelming outcomes were enough to break what he described as a prior “100% hit rate” framing. https://t.co/vfZFXTAN77 #BTC Weekly Hash Ribbons buy signal and what it means. #Crypto #Altcoins — Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) January 8, 2026 Still, Kev Capital argues the context is now different because the latest signal comes after a drawdown. He referenced a 36% decline in Bitcoin during the recent corrective period and suggested the early signs of miner recovery, reflected in the moving averages stabilizing and attempting to turn up, are the conditions where the indicator has historically performed best. However, he cautioned that timing is variable, saying the setup can take “two to four to six weeks” to play out, or move sooner. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,009.

    "title": "Why The Bitcoin Price Could Crash Another 20% To $76,000 Soon",
    "body": "The Bitcoin price could be in for more pain as a crypto analyst has just released a gloomy short-term outlook, warning that another crash may be on the way. The analyst believes that Bitcoin’s overall market structure remains bearish. As a result, he expects the price to fall to about $76,000, representing a 20% decline from current levels. Bitcoin Price At Risk Of 20% Crash Crypto market analyst Roman has issued a warning that Bitcoin could be heading for another sharp decline, with his primary target set near $76,000. In his post on X, he emphasized that the current market structure shows no evidence of a sustainable price bottom and that downside risk remains dominant. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To Crash Another 50% As Analyst Marks $40,000 Bottom Target Roman explained that his bearish outlook is based on the daily timeframe, where Bitcoin has struggled to regain strong bullish momentum after a significant correction. He also noted that the price is still trading within a broader bearish trend, suggesting the market may simply be taking a pause before the next move lower. The accompanying chart shows BTC trading above $90,000 while still well below the previous resistance area near $96,000. Each attempt to push higher has been rejected, suggesting sellers remain firmly in control of the market. Notably, Roman’s chart has revealed that the expected move lower could start with a drop back to the mid $80,000s, followed by a deeper slide between $78,500 and $75,000. The hand-drawn projection on the chart also illustrates a sharp fall after a brief relief rally, suggesting that BTC’s decline could speed up once support breaks. Volume behavior also plays a key role in Roman’s bearish outlook. The chart shows noticeably weak trading volume during Bitcoin’s recent rebound, which the analyst previously said is typical of holiday-driven pumps. Additional Signals That Support Analyst’s Bearish Forecast Roman’s $76,000 Bitcoin crash forecast is a follow-up to previous posts in which he explained several reasons why the leading cryptocurrency is in a bear market and could correct again soon. He referenced historical indicator behavior to justify his latest prediction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $25,000: Why The Bottom Is Much Lower The analyst explained that Bitcoin’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) were extremely oversold after its price dropped roughly 40% from its all-time high. As a result, the current consolidation has given these indicators a chance to reset. Roman sees the lack of strong buying pressure during this reset as a warning sign. He stressed that a true bullish reversal would need rising volume and clear higher highs, which are not showing on the daily chart. The analyst also noted that Bitcoin’s longer-term trend remains bearish, with the market continuing to form lower highs within a declining range. He has concluded that until clear reversal signals appear, traders should treat any upside moves as corrective, not the start of a fresh bull run.

    "title": "Cathie Wood: Trump May Buy Bitcoin For US Reserve Ahead Of Midterms",
    "body": "Cathie Wood, ARK Invest’s founder and CEO, said she expects the Trump administration could move beyond simply holding seized bitcoin and begin purchasing BTC to build a US strategic reserve, a shift she argued could become a catalytic signal for markets and other governments. Speaking on ARK’s “Bitcoin Brainstorm” podcast in an episode dated Jan. 08, Wood framed government buying as a potential inflection point at a time when she believes institutional participation remains “just beginning” and bitcoin’s supply dynamics are getting harder to ignore. “We have seen very little institutional buy-in, it is just beginning,” Wood said. “And I think if we get the US, for example, not adding just confiscated bitcoin to a strategic reserve but, you know, out there buying, and we don’t know if that’s going to be the case. But if they were to do so, I have a feeling that would set off what we’re all waiting for, which is, you know, the scarcity value to reassert itself again now that we’re near 20 million bitcoin outstanding and we only have one more million to go.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Emerges As A Hedge Amid Rising Global Geopolitical Tensions In the discussion, Wood suggested the administration’s posture so far has effectively been limited to confiscated holdings. She contrasted that with what she described as an earlier ambition for scale, noting “the original intent was to own a million bitcoin,” before adding her view that a pivot toward purchases is plausible. Midterms Could Drive US Bitcoin Reserve Buys Wood linked that possibility to political incentives heading into the 2026 US midterm elections, describing Trump as motivated to keep momentum and avoid being politically sidelined. “President Trump does not want to be a lame duck,” she said. “So I have a feeling that he is going to work with his crypto and AI czar to do a few things… [and] it seems as though there’s been reticence about actually buying bitcoin for the strategic reserve. So far, so far it’s confiscated… So I actually think they will start buying.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator With 84% Hit Rate Flashes Again: Is A Price Rally Next? Wood also pointed to what she sees as aligned constituencies around the president, arguing he has “all kinds of reasons” to lean into crypto while emphasizing that the political calculus matters because of the midterm timeline. When the conversation turned to how such purchases could be executed, Wood echoed the idea that any reserve strategy would need to be budget-neutral. She didn’t outline a mechanism, but treated the constraint as a key gating factor for feasibility. Wood argued that explicit US buying would not just be a domestic market event. Iit could force other capitals to revisit reserve policy. “Something that’s really important… we thought that countries would adopt it much earlier than they have,” she said. “I think if the US actually says, ‘Okay, now we’re going to buy,’ that’s going to spur a lot of other governments to think this thing through. Do they want to be hostage to the dollar…? And you know, no, they don’t. So put some bitcoin in your reserves.” If that dynamic accelerates, Wood warned emerging-market currencies could face renewed pressure, describing a scenario where reserve diversification toward bitcoin reshapes volatility across weaker fiat regimes, a downstream effect, she suggested, of Washington making the first overt move from holding seized BTC to competing in the open market. At press time, BTC traded at $90,578. Featured image from YouTube, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Wall Street Analyst Is Still Bullish On Bitcoin, Predicts Price Recovery",
    "body": "As the market remains divided on Bitcoin’s (BTC) near-term direction, one Wall Street analyst is standing firm in his bullish outlook. He predicts that Bitcoin could soon enter a price discovery, underscoring its value beyond being a payment currency to a market leader and one of the best-performing assets that could eventually reach gold’s market capitalization. Analyst Stays Bullish On Bitcoin Despite Price Instability In a recent interview with CNBC, William Blair’s fintech equity analyst Andrew Jeffrey said recent price swings do not change his long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s recovery and future value. CNBC opened the discussion by pointing out that crypto started the year on a stronger note than Q4 2025, rising about 5% before giving back more than 2% after a sharp rally. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Strongest XRP Price Rally In History Is Coming, Here’s Why When asked what was happening beneath the surface of Bitcoin’s latest moves, Jeffrey said its behavior reflects the nature of an immature asset. He explained that BTC has a market capitalization of more than $1.9 trillion. Yet, roughly one-third of the total supply is controlled by a small group of wallets, roughly estimated at 2 million. The Wall Street analyst stated that this supply concentration creates instability, especially during periods of market stress. He added that recent buyers, particularly retail investors entering through ETFs, tend to have weaker conviction and are more likely to sell during downturns. According to Jeffrey, these sell-offs can feed on themselves, leading to sharper declines. He said the current environment is broadly risk off, but emphasized that he sees this phase as temporary. The Wall Street analyst also highlighted his belief that Bitcoin will increasingly be viewed as a store of value. He stated that BTC could eventually challenge gold’s role in that category and move closer to the precious metal’s market cap, which is currently about 15x larger than Bitcoin’s today. While optimistic about Bitcoin’s outlook, Jeffrey made it clear that he does not see it becoming a dominant payment tool. Instead, he stated that stablecoins like Circle’s USDC are more suited for transactions. The analyst emphasized that price discovery is still underway and that BTC’s long-term potential remains intact despite recent market turbulence. Bitcoin Still Needs To Lead For Crypto To Rise In the interview, Jeffrey spoke with CNBC about fading excitement around Bitcoin as newer crypto stories attract attention. CNBC raised concerns that BTC feels like old news as prices hover and interest shifts towards more interesting news surrounding companies like Ripple. Related Reading: XRP Mirrors Gold’s Trajectory: What A Similar ATH Rally Would Mean Jeffrey replied that Bitcoin’s short-term price action is driven by investor psychology, while its long-term performance tells a different story. He highlighted that Bitcoin has been the best-performing asset in the world over the past decade and said investors need to maintain that perspective. CNBC also questioned whether crypto growth could now occur without Bitcoin leading the way. The Wall Street analyst responded that it would be very hard for the crypto market to see sustained gains without BTC at the forefront.
