Bitcoin failed to remain above $82,500 and started another decline. The price is trading below $80,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $79,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might dip further if it trades below the $75,000 and $74,000 levels. Bitcoin Price Dips Again Bitcoin price failed to remain stable above the $85,000 zone. BTC started a major decline below the $83,200 and $82,500 levels. The bears were able to push the price below $80,000. It spared major bearish moves, pushing the price below $78,000. A low was formed at $75,665, and the price is still signaling more downsides. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $79,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

A close above the $79,200 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $82,000 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $83,000 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $90,440 swing high to the $75,665 low. The next barrier for the bulls could be $84,000 and $84,500. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $79,200 resistance zone, it could start another decline.

    "title": "Crypto Hacks Explode: $370 Million Stolen In January Alone: Researchers",
    "body": "The start of this year brought a hard reminder: people remain the weakest link. Reports note that roughly $370 million in crypto were taken in January, a sharp climb from earlier months. Related Reading: Crypto Funds Bleed $1.80 Billion As Metals Rally Heats Up That surge was driven mostly by one massive social-engineering con that emptied a single victim of about $284 million. Simple lies and well-crafted messages beat code this time. Phishing Dominates Losses According to CertiK, phishing-style scams grabbed about $311 million of the January haul. That means most losses came from attackers tricking users and insiders rather than breaking cryptographic systems. Social pressure, fake links, and impersonation were used to push victims into moving funds. People clicked. Money moved. Accounts were drained. A Bigger Picture Of Monthly Swings Based on reports, January’s total is nearly four times the $98 million stolen in January 2025 and more than triple December’s close to $118 million. The month is the largest since February 2025, when roughly $1.5 billion was taken, most of that tied to the huge Bybit heist. Those big events show how a single breach or scam can tilt an entire month’s tally. Numbers can look calm one month and explosive the next. That unpredictability keeps wallets and treasuries on edge. #CertiKStatsAlert 🚨 Combining all the incidents in January we’ve confirmed ~$370.3M lost to exploits. ~$311.3M of the total is attributed to phishing with one victim losing ~$284M due to a social engineering scam. More details below 👇 pic.twitter.com/uXhi0P6dl5 — CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) January 31, 2026 Major Technical Exploits Hit Treasuries PeckShield flagged several large protocol attacks. Step Finance lost nearly $29 million after treasury wallets were compromised and over 261,000 SOL vanished. Truebit suffered a $26.4 million hit when a smart contract flaw allowed near-free minting, which also crushed its token price. SwapNet and Saga were among other victims, with losses around $13.3 million and $7 million respectively. Those hacks were technical, aggressive, and fast. #PeckShieldAlert In Jan. 2026, the crypto space saw 16 hacks totaling $86.01M in losses, representing a slight 1.42% YoY decrease compared to Jan. 2025 ($87.25M) but a notable 13.25% MoM surge from Dec. 2025 ($75.95M). Meanwhile, #phishing remains staggering with losses… pic.twitter.com/pxugbsPcZ7 — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) February 1, 2026 Why This Matters Now Reports say there were 40 exploit and scam incidents over January, though the bulk of value lost was concentrated in a few cases. That pattern means the raw count of incidents doesn’t tell the whole story; a single, well-executed con can dwarf many smaller breaches combined. Some months will show many small thefts. Other months will be defined by one enormous fraud. What Needs To Change Security teams and project treasuries must tighten both human and technical safeguards. More rigorous wallet controls, staged approvals, and stronger identity checks would blunt social-engineering strikes. At the same time, independent code audits and quicker response plans can limit damage from smart contract bugs. Education programs for staff and users are cheap compared with the cost of a single large loss. Related Reading: Gold Vs. XRP: One Asset Just Added 20x The Other’s Market Value The recent spike is a clear message: attackers are mixing social skill with technical know-how. The playbook now often starts with a message in a chat app or an email, then turns into code-level theft. Patching software helps. Teaching people how to spot scams will stop many attacks before they ever reach the code. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "XRP Price Falls Below $1.6: You Won’t Believe What Institutions Are Doing Amid The Crash",
    "body": "Crypto pundit X Finance Bull has highlighted how institutions are accumulating XRP amid the crypto market crash. His comment comes amid the XRP price drop below the psychological $1.6 level, which has further sparked bearish sentiments among retail investors. Institutions Are Still Accumulating Amid XRP Price Crash In an X post, X Finance Bull noted that while retail investors are panicking over the XRP price crash, institutional investors continue to accumulate the Ripple-linked token. The crypto pundit pointed to inflows into XRP ETFs, while Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs continue to see outflows. Based on this, he stated that the rotation is starting, with institutional investors moving from BTC and ETH to XRP. Related Reading: XRP Price At $10,000 Is Not A Prophecy: Analyst Shares Simple Framework That Points Higher SoSoValue data show that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs recorded outflows of $1.61 billion and $353 million, respectively, on January 30. Meanwhile, the XRP ETFs recorded a net inflow of $15.6 million. X Finance Bull noted that these inflows might be small now, but that direction matters. He further remarked that institutions don’t chase hype in choppy markets but rather position for fundamentals. The crypto pundit also noted that inflows into XRP ETFs, while Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are bleeding, aren’t random. He highlighted fundamentals that are bullish for the XRP price despite the current market crash. This includes the token’s cross-border payments utility, which he noted solves a “Quadrillion-dollar problem.” He added that regulatory clarity is coming and that infrastructure is already in place. X Finance Bull expects the XRP price to be among the first to recover when the market rebounds, noting that capital flows to utility. He added that the smart money is already front-running that shift. The crypto pundit also believes that those investing in XRP now are still early, given that the XRP ETFs have just recorded $1.18 billion cumulative inflows in three months. Two Potential Paths For The Altcoin At The Moment Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has highlighted two paths for the XRP price following its drop below $1.60. He stated that the first path is a double liquidity grab, whereby a relief bounce happens from here, followed by a second liquidity sweep and then an expansion. His accompanying chart showed that the second liquidity sweep could happen around $1.3. Meanwhile, the second path of the XRP price is a direct expansion, which aligns with the cycle fractal. Egrag Crypto stated that if history rhymes, the altcoin could record a 340% gain, similar to the 2021 bull cycle, or a larger 1,600% gain, similar to the 2017 bull cycle. A 340% surge and a 1,600% surge would put XRP at $7 and $27, respectively.

    "title": "Bitcoin Price Crash To $76,000: Why This Analyst Is Warning Against Buying",
    "body": "Since the recent Bitcoin price crash to $76,000, the broader crypto market has been on high alert, with sentiment shifting to extreme fear levels. A crypto analyst who has shared insights on Bitcoin’s latest market movements predicts more pain for the leading cryptocurrency. He has also warned investors against taking advantage of the decline and buying BTC during this highly volatile and unpredictable period. Analyst Warns Not To Go Long After Bitcoin Price Crash Crypto analyst Tyrex has warned investors against going long on Bitcoin following the recent price crash. Over the weekend, BTC experienced another devastating decline, dropping by more than 14% according to CoinMarketCap. For some investors, this drop may appear as an opportunity to buy the dip and go long on the leading cryptocurrency. However, Tyrex advises against making such a move. Related Reading: XRP Prints Bullish Divergence On The Weekly Chart, But Is ATHs Still Possible? The analyst stated in an X post on February 1, 2026, that Bitcoin had crashed to a new low around $76,000 on January 31, confirming a bearish breakout. He noted that, based on past market movements in which similar setups occurred, excluding fakeouts, Bitcoin is highly unlikely to stage a full recovery back to $85,000. Instead, he said the price is more likely to keep dumping until it completes its downside move and reaches a price discovery at lower levels. Tyrex cited Bitcoin’s price action in May 2021, May 2022, and June 22, noting that massive price crashes occurred during these periods after similar breaks in market structure. He said Bitcoin failed to recover quickly in each case and actually continued to crash on the daily chart after the main red candle was printed. The analyst’s accompanying Bitcoin chart shows the cryptocurrency trading above $79,000 at the time of his analysis, after it initiated a slight recovery from its previous low near $76,000. He projected on the chart that Bitcoin could soon resume its decline and fall toward the $75,400 region, representing a more than 4.5% decline. Tyrex added that a major support level sits around the $74,000 level on the weekly chart, which could temporarily hold off further downside. According to Tyrex, this level is equivalent to a key support near $2,100 for Ethereum. Related Reading: Analyst Says Chainlink Price Could Crash 50% If This Level Fails Analyst Shares Highly Likely BTC Decline In his analysis, Tyrex stated that, given Bitcoin’s latest price crash, structural weakness, and past cycle trends, he expects the cryptocurrency to retest recent lows once again. Considering his view that a recovery is unlikely, the analyst suggests that the near-term outlook for BTC is predominantly bearish. He noted that the $74,000 support is the main area for potential long positions. However, he expressed caution, noting that this level may not be particularly strong since it is relatively distant on the weekly chart and could be broken if Bitcoin continues its downward trend.

    "title": "Death of the Premium: Strategy’s Discount to NAV Breaks the $BTC Buying Machine, Helping $HYPER Soar",
    "body": "For years, Strategy (MSTR), formerly MicroStrategy, has traded as the market’s go-to high-beta Bitcoin proxy, commanding a massive premium (the Syalor Premium) over its Net Asset Value (NAV). Investors happily paid $2.00, sometimes even $2.50, for every $1.00 of Bitcoin on the balance sheet. They treated the stock like a leveraged ETF without the management fees. But that dynamic is breaking. Recent trading data suggests the famous ‘Saylor Premium’ isn’t just eroding; it’s occasionally flipping into a discount . Source Saylor Tracker That premium wasn’t just a vanity metric. It was the fuel for the entire engine. Strategy’s playbook relies heavily on ‘At-The-Market’ (ATM) equity offerings, effectively selling overvalued stock to acquire Bitcoin. When the stock trades at 2x NAV, issuing shares is mathematically beautiful; it increases the Bitcoin per share for existing holders. But if MSTR trades at a discount (sub-1.0 NAV ), that math turns punitive. Issuing undervalued stock to buy Bitcoin at market price actually dilutes the Bitcoin-per-share metric. Frankly, the panic here isn’t about solvency; Michael Saylor has structured the debt to avoid liquidation cascades, it’s about velocity. A discount throws sand in the gears of the accumulation machine, effectively neutralizing one of the market’s biggest, persistent buyers. As this corporate arbitrage trade dries up, capital is starting to rotate toward protocol-level innovations that offer yield without the friction of traditional equity markets. Innovations like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). Bitcoin Hyper Brings SVM Speed to Replace Corporate Proxies As the ‘paper Bitcoin’ trade faces structural headwinds, the narrative is shifting toward on-chain scalability. The market’s appetite for Bitcoin exposure hasn’t waned, but the mechanism is evolving. It’s moving from passive corporate holding companies to active Layer 2 infrastructure. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is catching this rotation, positioning itself as the first Bitcoin Layer 2 to integrate the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) . Source: Bitcoin Hyper While Strategy offers passive exposure, Bitcoin Hyper tackles Bitcoin’s ‘dinosaur’ problem: slow transactions and zero programmability. By using the SVM for execution while anchoring to Bitcoin L1 for settlement, Bitcoin Hyper unlocks sub-second finality. If Bitcoin remains solely a store of value, it competes only with gold. If it gains the programmable velocity of Solana through layers like Bitcoin Hyper, it competes with the global financial system. The setup fixes the bottleneck that has historically pushed developers to Ethereum or Solana. Through a decentralized Canonical Bridge and Rust-based developer SDKs, Bitcoin Hyper allows DeFi applications, swaps, lending, and gaming to exist directly on top of Bitcoin liquidity. If you’re watching the MSTR premium evaporate, this represents a fundamental shift. It’s no longer about betting on a CEO’s buying strategy; it’s about betting on the expansion of the network itself. Find out more in our ‘What is Bitcoin Hyper’ guide. Whales Accumulate $HYPER as Smart Contract Utility Grows Smart money is already hedging against the stagnation of traditional Bitcoin proxies by moving into early-stage infrastructure. Whales are signaling high-conviction positioning before the public mainnet launch, with $HYPER purchases as high as $500K . Our ‘ Bitcoin Hyper Price Prediction ‘ also shows we think it’s got good legs. Our experts predict that by the end of 2026 it could reach prices as high as $0.02595. That’s a potential ROI of 89% this year alone. The presale shows that $HYPER is doing well, having already raised over $31M , with tokens currently priced at $0.013675. Unlike the Strategy model, which relies on capital markets to generate accretion, Bitcoin Hyper uses a direct staking model. The protocol offers a high APY currently standing at 38%. Source: X This creates a sharp divergence. MSTR shareholders rely on stock issuance premiums, a variable they can’t control. Conversely, on-chain staking offers programmatic yield derived from network activity. With Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) offering immediate staking after TGE (subject to a 7-day vesting period for presale participants), the incentives look much closer to DeFi standards than Wall Street equities. As the discount to NAV makes corporate accumulation harder, the ‘real yield’ in the Bitcoin ecosystem is likely to migrate toward these functional Layer 2s.

    "title": "UAE Investment in Trump’s WLF: Will Aggressive Change Bring the Hype for Best Crypto like $MAXI?",
    "body": "The intersection of sovereign wealth and decentralized finance has shifted from theory to hard negotiation. Reports of UAE investment flowing into Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLF) signal a major pivot in how political crypto projects operate. This isn’t just about campaign financing or political branding. It represents a structural shift. Source: X Nation-state capital, specifically from hubs like Dubai and Abu Dhabi, is poised to validate this speculative asset class on a global stage. When analysts talk about ‘aggressive change,’ they are referring to WLF’s rumored restructuring to court Middle Eastern institutional players. If sealed, that deal injects massive liquidity into the ecosystem. And history is clear here: when sovereign entities enter the chat, markets don’t accumulate gradually. They reprice violently. The downstream effect is predictable. Retail traders, priced out of institutional rounds, scramble for high-beta assets that match this aggressive sentiment. The market splits. While the UAE and Trump negotiate infrastructure, the retail cohort hunts for volatility. It’s the perfect storm for ‘leverage culture’ projects, tokens embodying the high-risk, high-reward mentality of the bull run. As institutional money anchors the top, liquidity spills into aggressive contenders like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , positioned to capture that speculative overflow. Leveraging Gym Culture And Aggressive Tokenomics While WLF targets the suit-and-tie crowd, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) corners the ‘degens’ driving actual on-chain volume. Frankly, the dog-coin market is saturated. $MAXI differentiates itself by pivoting away from kawaii aesthetics toward a ‘gym bro’ culture equating physical gains with portfolio growth. Think of it as a 240-lb canine juggernaut built for the 1000x leverage mentality. Source: Maxi Doge In a bull run, narrative fit often beats technical novelty. Maxi Doge capitalizes on this by baking utility into its meme structure. We’re talking planned holder-only trading competitions and a ‘Maxi Fund’ treasury dedicated to liquidity partnerships. Instead of passive holding, the ecosystem encourages active participation through leaderboard rewards, appealing to the exact demographic currently bored by low-volatility infrastructure coins. Running on Ethereum, the protocol uses smart contracts to govern supply, preventing the inflationary spirals typical of lower-cap assets. By branding itself around ‘never skipping leg day,’ the project signals a commitment to the grind of the bull market, a stark contrast to the passive income promises of previous cycles. If you’re watching the Trump-UAE headlines, $MAXI represents the retail answer: a tool designed to lift, trade, and repeat until it dominates the charts. Explore the official Maxi Doge presale here. Whale Accumulation Signals Confidence In Maxi Doge Smart money appears to be front-running the broader retail crowd, likely anticipating that the aggressive shift in market sentiment will benefit high-octane meme tokens. On-chain data shows the largest $MAXI purchases at $314K and $314K . Clearly, high-net-worth individuals are looking beyond the top 10 for yield. Maxi Doge has already raised over $4.5M, with tokens currently sitting at $0.0002802. That steady capital inflow suggests the ‘Leverage King’ narrative is sticking (and backed by a staking model rewarding conviction). The project offers a dynamic APY currently at 68%. This incentivizes you to lock supply for up to a year, reducing sell pressure during price discovery. When whales lock that much capital, it usually signals an expectation of post-launch momentum, a sharp contrast to the ‘pump and dump’ mechanics of some launches. Want in?

    "title": "SUI Slides Into Key Fib Support — Is the Downtrend Far From Over?",
    "body": "SUI is back under pressure after sliding into a key Fibonacci support zone, raising fresh concerns about whether the recent pullback is only a pause or the start of a deeper downside move. With bearish momentum still in play and no clear reversal signal yet, the market is now at a critical decision point that could shape SUI’s next major move. Fibonacci Support Comes Into Focus Crypto analyst More Crypto Online, in a recent update, revealed that SUI has now reached its next Fibonacci-based support levels, bringing key downside zones into focus. The 61.8% retracement sits near $1.20, while a broader support region extends between $0.91 and $1.70. These areas are defined using different analytical methods, with the orange zone representing retracement-based support and the blue zone derived from a measured comparison between the initial A-wave decline bottoming in April last year and the current C-wave. Related Reading: SUI At The Smart Money Zone: Big Moves Brewing Above $2 From a structural perspective, SUI continues to display relative weakness when compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, all of which remain above their April 2025 lows. SUI has already broken below that level, reinforcing the view that downside pressure remains dominant. According to the analysis, the breakdown aligns with either a fifth wave to the downside unfolding within circle wave C, or with price moving through circle wave 3 of a larger bearish sequence. At this stage, no technical signs confirm that a local bottom has formed. Both the yellow and white scenarios outlined in the analysis continue to allow for further downside. As long as price action fails to show clear reversal signals, additional weakness cannot be ruled out. White Scenario: SUI Third Wave Down Remains In Play The analyst further highlighted that under the white scenario, the market is considered to be in a third wave to the downside within a broader bearish structure. In this case, circle wave 3 is expected to reach at least the $0.915 level and could extend even lower. The more directly price continues to decline, the greater the likelihood that this bearish interpretation remains in play. Related Reading: SUI Reclaims Smart Money Zone, While Weekly Structure Signals Big Move Ahead In contrast, the yellow scenario still leaves room for a future recovery. This outlook allows for a rally that could lead to new highs as part of a broader C-wave advance. However, for this bullish case to gain credibility, the market would need to deliver a clear five-wave move to the upside. Without such confirmation, any upward movement is more likely to develop as a corrective wave 4 within the white scenario rather than the start of a new impulsive rally. In that context, rebounds would be expected to face resistance, with the standard resistance zone currently defined between $1.81 and $2.55. Featured image from YouTube, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "MSTR Price Dwindles as Strategy’s $BTC Holdings Show $900M in Unrealized Losses",
    "body": "MicroStrategy (MSTR) has long acted as a high-beta proxy for Bitcoin. But that leverage is a double-edged sword. As Bitcoin faces resistance, the valuation of corporate treasuries is suddenly under the microscope. Reports suggest the firm’s aggressive accumulation strategy temporarily left a chunk of holdings underwater, with some metrics pointing to $900M in unrealized losses during local lows. That volatility isn’t just a headline number; it’s a signal to institutional risk managers that the era of simply ‘parking’ Bitcoin is getting harder to justify without yield. The correlation between MSTR stock and spot Bitcoin prices remains tight, yet the divergence in volatility is widening. While Michael Saylor’s “buy and hold” thesis relies on infinite time horizons, Wall Street lives and dies by quarterly results. When the underlying asset sits idle, generating zero yield while subjecting the balance sheet to massive drawdowns, investors start questioning capital efficiency. Frankly, the market is demanding that Bitcoin do more than just collect dust in cold storage. This sentiment shift is forcing a migration of capital toward infrastructure that makes the asset productive. While traditional equity investors sweat over MSTR’s unrealized PnL, on-chain liquidity is moving aggressively into Layer 2 solutions that solve Bitcoin’s dormancy problem. The focus is shifting from companies that hoard Bitcoin to protocols that activate it. Leading this pivot is Bitcoin Hyper, a project utilizing the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to bring high-speed execution to the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Hyper Activates Idle Capital With SVM Integration The main knock against the MicroStrategy model is capital inefficiency. Bitcoin stored in a corporate treasury is secure, sure, but it’s effectively dead capital until sold. Bitcoin Hyper addresses this by introducing the first Bitcoin Layer 2 integrated with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). This architecture allows Bitcoin to move with the speed of Solana, sub-second finality and negligible fees, while keeping the security guarantees of the Bitcoin network intact. For developers and DeFi users, this is a game changer. Previous scaling attempts like the Lightning Network or Stacks often struggled with latency or complexity. By adopting the SVM, Bitcoin Hyper lets developers write smart contracts in Rust and deploy high-performance dApps that leverage native Bitcoin liquidity. This unlocks use cases previously reserved for Ethereum or Solana: high-frequency trading, real-time gaming, and complex lending markets, all denominated in $BTC. The technical implications are significant. Bitcoin Hyper uses a modular blockchain structure where Bitcoin L1 handles settlement and the SVM L2 handles execution. A decentralized canonical bridge ensures trustless transfers, meaning users can bridge their $BTC to access high-yield DeFi opportunities without relying on centralized custodians. In a market where holding creates ‘unrealized losses,’ the ability to stake and utilize Bitcoin changes the equation entirely. Buy your $HYPER on the official page. Whales Accumulate $31M as Smart Money Targets L2 Infrastructure While traditional finance focuses on MSTR’s daily chart, on-chain data suggests a different narrative is playing out in the presale market. Smart money is clearly positioning itself for a ‘Bitcoin DeFi’ summer. According to the official presale page, Bitcoin Hyper has raised over $31M signaling robust demand for infrastructure that unlocks Bitcoin’s programmable potential. The accumulation patterns are distinct. Smart money is moving. Etherscan data reveals three high-net-worth wallets accumulated over $1M in the most recent buys, with the largest single buy hitting $500K . This isn’t retail behavior. These ‘whale’ wallets appear to be securing allocation in the infrastructure layer before the wider market catches on. Currently priced at $0.013675, the $HYPER token serves as the fuel for this new ecosystem, handling gas fees and governance within the L2. The tokenomics include a high-APY staking mechanism immediately available after TGE, designed to incentivize long-term security. For investors watching MicroStrategy’s volatility with concern, the rotation into a protocol that offers yield and utility represents a logical hedge. The market is voting with its wallet, and the vote is for a programmable Bitcoin. Visit the official Bitcoin Hyper site.

    "title": "The $ETH Exodus: $ETH Slides to 68th as ‘Blue Chip’ Crypto Underperforms in the Market",
    "body": "The ‘ultrasound money’ narrative has gone quiet. While Bitcoin corrected a manageable 11% amid macro headwinds, Ether took a violent 14.5% hit, a divergence that has rattled the confidence of long-term holders. That price action pushed Ethereum’s market capitalization down to roughly $300B. It now sits at 68th in global asset rankings , trailing behind traditional ‘boomer’ equities like Coca-Cola and Cisco. Source: 8marketcap This isn’t just a dip; it’s an identity crisis. The $ETH/$BTC ratio has bled to multi-year lows, suggesting that institutional capital views Bitcoin as the sole safe haven. Meanwhile, retail liquidity is bypassing Ethereum entirely for faster, higher-beta ecosystems. The reality? Ethereum is currently trading more like a leveraged play on the Nasdaq than the decentralized computer of the future. But liquidity in crypto rarely vanishes; it rotates. As the ‘blue chip’ premium evaporates from Ether, sophisticated traders are moving down the risk curve. They’re hunting for assets that offer the volatility and community-driven upside Ethereum has temporarily lost. This rotation is fueling a surge in specialized trading tokens like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , which prioritize high-leverage culture and gamified returns over slow-moving infrastructure roadmaps. Volatility Hunters Rotate Into Maxi Doge ($MAXI) While the broader market stagnates, smart money is positioning for the aggressive leg of the bull cycle. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has emerged as a key beneficiary of this rotation. It pitches itself not just as a meme token, but as a ‘Leverage King’ ecosystem for the high-octane retail trader. Unlike the passive holding strategy currently punishing $ETH investors, $MAXI is built on active participation: ‘lift, trade, repeat.’ Source: Maxi Doge The appetite for this approach is clear. According to the official presale page, Maxi Doge has raised over $4.5M, signaling strong conviction despite the macro downturn. Priced at just $0.0002802, the token lowers the barrier to entry for retail traders who have been priced out of meaningful gains in major caps. What separates Maxi Doge from standard speculative assets? A utility layer tailored for the “degen” economy. The ecosystem plans to feature holder-only trading competitions with leaderboard rewards, directly incentivizing the volume and engagement currently fleeing the Ethereum mainnet. Plus, the project implements a Maxi Fund treasury to sustain liquidity and back partnerships with futures platforms. This structure suggests the team is building a sticky ecosystem for traders who find traditional spot holding too slow for the current cycle. Want in already? We’ve got you covered. Check out our ‘ How to Buy Maxi Doge ‘ guide. Whale Accumulation Signals Shift to High-Beta Assets The thesis that capital is fleeing ‘unproductive’ blue chips for new entrants is supported by on-chain forensics. While Ethereum whales have been net distributors recently, substantial buy orders are hitting the Maxi Doge contract. It looks like high-net-worth players are front-running the public launch. On-chain data from Etherscan shows two whale wallets accumulated $628K. The individual amounts, $314K , and $314K a signal of ‘smart money’ positioning. It suggests insiders expect the token to outperform sluggish majors once it hits public markets. Beyond buy pressure, the protocol’s staking mechanics offer shelter from market chop. The smart contract governs a dynamic APY system currently at 38%. However this is subject to change. If you’re fatigued by Ethereum’s slide, earning yield on a high-leverage asset offers a compelling alternative to holding a depreciating ‘blue chip.’ As Ethereum struggles to reclaim its narrative, the ‘gym bro’ energy of Maxi Doge, embodied by its 1000x leverage mentality, is capturing a market hungry for gains.

    "title": "Analyst Highlights What People Are Missing In The XRP Price Chart",
    "body": "An XRP analyst is pushing back against the growing sense of boredom surrounding XRP’s price action, with the outlook that people are misreading what is actually happening on the higher timeframes. Taking to the social media platform X, an analyst known as XRP QUEEN said traders are overlooking a typical setup that has always preceded some of XRP’s most notable rallies. Her view is based on XRP’s weekly price structure and a comparison with how previous long consolidation phases eventually resolved. Why XRP $1.50 To $3 Range Matters More Than It Looks A look at the weekly candlestick timeframe chart shows that XRP’s price action over multiple months has been largely confined between support at $1.5 and resistance just above $3. Interestingly, according to the analysis from XRP Queen, XRP’s price action being pinned between roughly $1.50 and $3 is not a sign of weakness but a repeat of earlier accumulation zones. Related Reading: Pundit Says XRP Price Is Not A ‘Crypto’ Question, But A Systemically Important Liquidity Asset The chart shows how the token has previously spent long stretches moving sideways for hundreds of days, highlighted on the chart as 200-day, 800-day, and even 1,000-day consolidation phases. In each case, price compression eventually gave way to a vertical move higher, labeled as MOON on the chart. The key point being made is that these flat, frustrating periods tend to drain interest and attention from the market. That drop in engagement, according to the analyst, has always aligned with smart accumulation. The longer the range holds, the more pressure builds beneath the surface. $2.72 And The Projection Of A Teleport Move A notable level on the chart is the $2.72 zone, which is sitting around the 0.786 Fibonacci extension level projected from XRP price lows in 2018. Breaking and holding above $2.72 would be important to how XRP rallies to new all-time highs. As noted by XRP Queen, if $2.72 holds, then the next outlook is looking at $9-$15. Related Reading: Pundit Explains Why The XRP Price Hitting $100 Isn’t Delusional Once XRP leaves this range, it teleports. No pullbacks and no second chances. The projection on the chart shows Fibonacci extensions stretching far above the current price. These extensions include 0.786 at $2.71, the 1.0 extension around $3.40, followed by 1.618 at $5.47, 2.818 at $8.78, and the most extreme 4.764 extension around $15.89, all pointing to price targets to be broken once the current range is broken. However, the altcoin is currently trading far below the $2.72 level needed to confirm the price teleportation to interesting highs. At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $1.60, meaning the price would need to climb by about 69% just to retest $2.72. Until that happens, XRP is in consolidation mode, and it is unclear how long it will keep trading sideways in the current range. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "The Solana price has entered the new month under pressure after losing a level that had acted as a psychological anchor for much of the past year. The token’s drop below $100 shifted market attention from recovery narratives to damage control. Related Reading: Crypto Hacks Explode: $370 Million Stolen In January Alone: Researchers Traders are now closely watching whether upcoming support levels can halt a decline that has accelerated amid overall weakness in the crypto market. Although network activity and institutional interest continue to draw attention, short-term price movements have clearly shifted into a bearish trend. SOL's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Solana Price Breaks $100 as Selling Pressure Builds Before bouncing back to the current $102 level, the Solana price dipped to around $98, marking its lowest point in nearly ten months and extending losses to nearly 20% over the past week and approximately 25% over the last month. Trading activity has thinned as prices fell, with spot volume and derivatives participation both declining. Data from CoinGlass shows falling open interest, suggesting long positions are being unwound rather than a surge in aggressive short selling. The move has not occurred in isolation. A wave of market-wide liquidations over the weekend, combined with thin liquidity, amplified downside moves across major cryptocurrencies. Macroeconomic concerns have also weighed on sentiment after renewed expectations of tighter U.S. monetary policy following President Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair, a choice viewed as hawkish by markets. Technical Outlook Points to Lower Support Levels From a technical perspective, Solana’s structure has weakened. The break below $100 confirmed a pattern of lower highs and lower lows, with the Solana price hovering well beneath its declining short-term moving averages. Bollinger Bands are widening, and Solana price action remains near the lower band, suggesting downward momentum remains dominant rather than stabilizing. Momentum indicators underline the pressure. The daily relative strength index is hovering near 25, placing SOL deep in oversold territory. While this increases the probability of short-term bounces, it does not, on its own, signal a trend reversal. On the downside, traders are watching the $95 area closely, followed by a broader $92–90 zone. Below that, $85 and $80 stand out as larger historical support levels. Some on-chain and pattern analyses suggest that if selling accelerates, thinner support could expose deeper zones later in the year. Fundamentals Remain Active Despite Weak Price Action Despite the bearish price forecast, Solana’s underlying network metrics remain comparatively strong. January transaction counts rose sharply, and recent data shows continued growth in on-chain activity and stablecoin usage. Institutional interest has been mixed but not absent, with earlier January inflows offset by more recent Solana ETF outflows. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? CMT Reveals What Traders Need To See Now Currently, the technical picture dominates. Solana would need to reclaim $110 and hold above key moving averages to ease bearish pressure. Until that happens, rallies are likely to be viewed as corrective moves within a broader downtrend, leaving the next support levels as the market’s immediate test.

    "title": "XRP Market Structure “Very Similar” To April 2022, Glassnode Says",
    "body": "As XRP slides below $1.60, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has highlighted how the current structure is looking similar to that of April 2022. XRP Is Fast Approaching Its Realized Price In a new post on X, Glassnode has talked about where XRP is currently trading with respect to its Realized Price. This on-chain indicator measures the cost basis or acquisition price of the average address on the blockchain. When the spot price of the cryptocurrency is trading above this metric, it means the investors as a whole can be assumed to be in a state of profit. On the other hand, it being below the indicator suggests the majority of the supply is underwater. Related Reading: Bitcoin Death Cross That Last Preceded A 66% Drop Is Back Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the XRP Realized Price over the last several years: As is visible in the above graph, the XRP spot price has been above the Realized Price since 2024, indicating that holders have been enjoying net unrealized gains. The degree of profitability, however, hasn’t been constant in this period. The asset’s price had the largest gap over the metric back in late 2024, owing to a fast bull rally. Then, over the first three quarters of 2025, profitability gradually dropped as tokens changed hands at higher levels, leading to an increase in the Realized Price. The indicator hit a plateau in the last quarter of the year, but the bearish shift in the asset meant that it was now the price’s turn to approach the line, cutting back on average investor profits further. This trend has deepened recently. Following the sector-wide crash during the past week, XRP has come dangerously close to the Realized Price, which now sits at $1.48. “The current market structure is very similar to that of April 2022,” noted the analytics firm. Back then, the asset was transitioning to a bear market and its price fell to the Realized Price. That retest failed, and what followed was a steep move down that eventually led to the cycle low. Given the proximity that the current XRP price has to the indicator, it now remains to be seen whether a retest will occur in the near future and if it would lead to further bearish action like in 2022.
