    "title": "STH Panic Emerges as Bitcoin Crashes To $81K: Realized P/L Turns Negative For The First Time This Cycle",
    "body": "Bitcoin is struggling to find support after losing the $85,000 level and plunging to $81,000, marking its weakest point since early spring. Bulls have clearly lost control of the trend, and fear now dominates the market, with sentiment rapidly shifting from caution to outright panic. Many traders are calling for a confirmed bear market, while others argue the move is an orchestrated shakeout designed to flush out weak hands before the next macro leg. Related Reading: Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden Deposits Final 2,499 BTC ($228M) to Kraken – Details Amid the chaos, top analyst Axel Adler shared new insights that highlight a structural shift beneath the surface. Until just yesterday, short-term holders (STHs) appeared relatively stable despite the correction. However, the situation has now changed dramatically. The Realized P/L component — which measures whether investors are selling at a profit or loss — has fallen to –1, signaling broad loss realization across the STH cohort. This metric turning negative for the first time in weeks confirms that capitulation among recent buyers is accelerating, a dynamic that historically increases pressure on the spot market. Although the sell-off is severe, some analysts argue that these conditions resemble previous manipulation-driven liquidity grabs, where deep corrections eventually set the foundation for sharp rebounds. STH Panic Mirrors Past Cyclical Bottom Signals Adler explains that the latest spike in short-term holder (STH) panic is not an isolated event — it closely resembles patterns seen during previous market bottoms. The chart clearly shows that similar surges in STH loss realization occurred in July 2021 and again throughout the 2022–2023 bear market, each time leading to accelerated selling, liquidity stress, and deeper short-term corrections. These phases were marked by fear-driven capitulation, where recent buyers dumped coins rapidly, often exaggerating the downside but ultimately exhausting available sell pressure. Today, that same structure is reappearing. With STH Realized P/L dropping sharply and the STH-MVRV ratio sitting below 1, fear has pushed many recent entrants into loss, triggering panic moves. Adler notes that this kind of forced selling tends to cluster near the end of corrections, not the beginning. Once STHs capitulate, the market often shifts into a period of stabilization as long-term holders absorb supply. Despite extreme sentiment across social and derivative markets, several analysts argue that this setup could create the conditions for a recovery. Historically, when STH panic peaks and long-term holders remain steady, Bitcoin has often staged strong rebounds in the weeks that follow. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mean Reversion Oscillator Prints First Green Oversold Bar in Months – A Classic Bull-Market Bottom Signal BTC Testing Key Demand Levels Bitcoin has entered a steep downtrend, and the chart clearly reflects the intensity of the current sell-off. BTC has dropped to the $83K–$84K range, marking one of the sharpest declines of this cycle. The breakdown accelerated once price lost the $92K and $90K supports, and the chart now shows a near-vertical move to the downside — a classic sign of capitulation-driven selling. On the daily timeframe, BTC is trading well below the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages. All three have begun sloping downward, forming a full bearish alignment that signals weakening momentum across multiple time horizons. Price is currently attempting to stabilize around the 200-day moving average (red line), one of the last major trend supports in a macro bull structure. A clean close below this level could open the door to deeper downside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Capitulation Deepens Around $90K Level: Classic Late-Stage Fear Structure Emerging Volume has spiked aggressively over the past sessions, confirming panic participation. Unlike earlier corrections, this one shows sustained distribution without meaningful bounces, suggesting forced selling from short-term holders and large entities. However, the chart also shows early signs of selling exhaustion. Candles are printing long lower wicks, and intraday volatility has increased — conditions that often precede a temporary bottom.

    "title": "XRP Price Has Surged 15% Anytime This Metric Appeared In The Past",
    "body": "Analysts note that the XRP price is showing unusual resilience, as a key metric previously seen before short-term rebounds reappears on its chart. In a new technical analysis, crypto market expert Dom points out that the latest market setup mirrors conditions that have led to at least a 10% surge each time this pattern emerges. Recurring Metric Signals 10% XRP Price Surge In an X post released while XRP was still trading around $2.19, Dom highlighted a familiar technical signal, noting that past appearances of a bid-skew metric on the chart have consistently led to sharp price recoveries. As a reflection of its previous stability, the analyst stated the XRP had displayed incredible strength over the last several days, trading above the $2 level. Related Reading: Analyst Claims XRP Price Will Surge To $220 Due To ETFs, But Is This Possible? Even as the Bitcoin price plummeted by more than $15,000 in the past few days, the analyst pointed out that XRP had maintained its local low from November 5. The accompanying chart highlights this divergence between XRP and BTC, where the altcoin’s structure holds its range despite the widespread market downturn. Historically, when XRP has shown such strength during periods of Bitcoin weakness, Dom notes that it has signaled countless price reversals. The analyst further highlighted that over the past three months, every time the recurring bid-skew pattern appeared, XRP followed with an upswing of at least 10%. If the historical metric holds, Dom’s analysis suggests there could be a continuation of XRP’s recent resilience, potentially driving its price up by 10% to at least $2.09. At the time of the analyst’s post, this target may have been higher, since XRP was still trading above $2. However, the cryptocurrency has since fallen below that threshold, reaching $1.9 at the time of writing. XRP CVD Data Reveals Controlled Selling Pressure In a subsequent update, Dom shared a second chart, showing that XRP’s price had declined from its previous level of $2.19 to $2.01. He highlighted that this negative price action serves as a reminder that market dynamics don’t always follow textbook patterns. The recent decline in XRP also falls into roughly 15% of cases where typical orderbook signals fail to predict short-term moves. Related Reading: Here’s How High The XRP Price Needs To Be To Flip Bitcoin In the Binance spot market, Dom points out evidence of “controlled” selling rather than forced liquidations. Unlike earlier periods where strong bids consistently led to upward price momentum, XRP’s Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) curves on Binance, Coinbase, Bybit, and other exchanges are sloping downwards. Moreover, among all the crypto exchanges, Binance has recorded the most decline. Dom notes that controlled selling can be seen clearly in the smoothed cumulative volume lines on the chart. He warns that these developments are tricky to time. Moreover, without a sudden climax or sharp liquidation, bottoming could form slowly, making entries based on traditional reversal signals more challenging.

    "title": "$400 Million XRP Offloaded in Just 48 Hours, What’s Behind the Massive Sell Pressure?",
    "body": "XRP has been hit by one of its most aggressive sell waves this year, with on-chain data revealing that major whale wallets offloaded nearly 200 million XRP, roughly $400 million, within just 48 hours. Related Reading: Ethereum Dead Cat Bounce Puts Price At $3,400, But What’s The Ultimate Target? According to Santiment analytics, wallets holding between one million and ten million tokens were the primary contributors, adding significant sell-side liquidity to an already fragile market. This sudden influx of supply arrived at a time when XRP was already battling bearish sentiment across the broader crypto space. The asset slipped 10.32% in 24 hours, falling below the key $2 psychological level, touching lows near $1.85, and posting double-digit losses within a single day. XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Extreme Fear Grips the Market Market indicators paint a grim picture. XRP is trading below both its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages, signalling sustained downward momentum. The Fear & Greed Index sits at 14, firmly in “extreme fear” territory, while selling volume surged past $7.2 billion in 24 hours. Analysts warn that a failure to reclaim resistance near $2.30 could open the door to deeper losses, with short-term projections suggesting a potential drop toward $1.50 if bearish pressure continues. The weakness is not isolated to XRP. Bitcoin’s retreat below the $85,000 zone and Ethereum’s slide below $3,000 have triggered market-wide liquidations, with macro uncertainty adding fuel. Concerns over a possible delay in Federal Reserve rate cuts, driven by soft U.S. jobs data and rising unemployment, have dented investor appetite for risk assets across the board. Will XRP Stabilize or Sink Further? The big question now is whether whales will continue distributing or pause their offloading. If no new wave of large-scale selling emerges, analysts believe XRP could stabilize and attempt to reclaim the $2 mark in the coming sessions. Recovery projections place the short-term target between $2.50 and $2.70, though this would require a decisive break above long-standing resistance. Medium-term predictions remain cautiously optimistic but restrained. Many experts expect XRP to trade between $1.96 and $2.27 into the end of 2025, with stronger upside momentum unlikely until regulatory clarity and upcoming ETF activity begin shaping demand heading into 2026.

Related Reading: Ethereum Dead Cat Bounce Puts Price At $3,400, But What’s The Ultimate Target? With Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other major assets plunging sharply, traders are bracing for what could be another turbulent stretch, especially with billions in options set to expire. ETH's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Massive Liquidations Trigger Steep Sell-Off According to data from Coinglass, more than $2 billion in long and short positions were liquidated over the last 24 hours, marking one of the most severe unwinding events since October’s historic crash. Bitcoin (BTC) crashed as low as $82,000, while Ethereum (ETH) slid below $2,700. Traders holding long positions bore the brunt of the damage, with over $1.8 million in longs wiped out across major exchanges. The largest single liquidation order took place on Hyperliquid, where a massive BTC-USD position valued at $36.78 million was wiped out. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin long liquidations alone have totaled approximately $966 million, while Ethereum long positions have similarly suffered around $407 million in losses. With no details revealed on the specific tokens or exchanges involved, the incident still sent shockwaves through the community, further fueling bearish sentiment. Options Expiry and Whale Moves Add to Market Pressure The sell-off comes ahead of a crucial $4.2 billion crypto options expiry, with more than 39,000 BTC options and 185,000 ETH options set to expire. Traders have leaned heavily into put positions, signaling expectations of further downside. For Bitcoin, the max pain point sits near $98,000, well above current prices, while Ethereum’s around $3,200. Meanwhile, whale behavior has added fuel to the fire. A mega BTC whale who has held Bitcoin since 2011 reportedly sold over 11,000 BTC, worth $1.3 billion, intensifying downward pressure. However, at the same time, other large holders accumulated over $65 million in spot BTC near the $85,000 level, hinting at strategic dip-buying even as volatility spikes. Fragile Liquidity Keeps Market on Edge The market’s instability can be traced back to October’s $19.5 billion liquidation event, which severely disrupted liquidity conditions. Market makers, still recovering from the shock, remain cautious, creating a fragile environment where even minor price swings can trigger cascading liquidations. Despite the chaos, signs of resilience emerged from infrastructure players like Solana and Fireblocks, which maintained high transaction speeds and network reliability during periods of unprecedented stress.

    "title": "Anti-CZ Whale Loses Big: $61M in Profit Wiped Out As Ethereum and XRP Longs Collapse",
    "body": "Ethereum has officially broken below key support levels, and market sentiment is rapidly deteriorating as major assets across the crypto landscape continue to slide. Analysts are increasingly calling for the arrival of a new bear market, noting that both Bitcoin and the leading altcoins have lost critical technical zones that previously held the broader structure together. ETH, now trading at multi-month lows, is feeling the full weight of cascading liquidations, strong sell-side volume, and evaporating investor confidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden Deposits Final 2,499 BTC ($228M) to Kraken – Details Adding to the growing uncertainty, Lookonchain reports a striking development: in just 10 days, more than $61 million in profit has disappeared for a well-known market participant often referred to as the Anti-CZ Whale. This trader previously gained attention for aggressively opening shorts immediately after CZ purchased ASTER — a move that paid off handsomely until the recent violent downturn reversed his fortunes. The Anti-CZ Whale’s Unrealized Profit Collapse Adds Pressure According to Lookonchain, the trader known as the Anti-CZ Whale has taken a massive hit during the latest market downturn — and Ethereum sits at the center of the damage. Just 10 days ago, this whale had accumulated nearly $100 million in total profit on Hyperliquid, largely fueled by aggressive positions built during periods of high volatility. However, as the crypto market sharply corrected, his oversized ETH and XRP longs turned against him. The result has been a brutal drawdown: his total profit has now fallen to just $38.4 million, wiping out more than 60% of gains in less than two weeks. This dramatic reversal reflects more than one trader’s misfortune — it signals the extent of the pressure weighing on Ethereum. As ETH continues to decline and investor sentiment deteriorates, even the most seasoned actors are struggling to navigate the volatility. The whale’s rapid profit erosion highlights how quickly bullish conviction can shift when key support levels fail. For Ethereum, holding the current zone is crucial. Price action has already inflicted significant pain across longs, short-term holders, and leveraged players. If ETH loses this support decisively, the next wave of forced selling could deepen losses and accelerate the broader market capitulation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mean Reversion Oscillator Prints First Green Oversold Bar in Months – A Classic Bull-Market Bottom Signal ETH Price Analysis: Testing a Major Weekly Support Zone Ethereum has entered a critical phase on the weekly timeframe, with price pulling back sharply toward the $2,680 region — a level that now acts as the last meaningful support before a deeper market breakdown. The chart shows a strong rejection from the $4,500 zone earlier this quarter, followed by a sustained series of lower highs and lower lows, confirming a medium-term downtrend. The 50-week moving average has been lost decisively, and ETH is now sitting directly on top of the 100-week MA, a level that has historically acted as a key pivot during major market corrections. Volume has expanded during the recent drop, highlighting an environment driven by fear and forced selling rather than controlled profit-taking. This aligns with broader market conditions, where liquidity is thin and volatility remains elevated across majors. A clean break below $2,650 would open the door for a retest of the $2,300–$2,400 zone, which served as strong accumulation during previous cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Capitulation Deepens Around $90K Level: Classic Late-Stage Fear Structure Emerging However, the weekly chart also shows that ETH is entering a historically oversold area, similar to mid-2022 and late-2023, where reversals eventually formed after weeks of compression. For now, Ethereum must hold above this weekly support to avoid a deeper retrace and preserve the structure needed for a potential recovery. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "According to exchange and on-chain data, global crypto markets plunged Friday as prices slid and forced a widespread sell-off. Bitcoin fell under $83,000, while Ethereum traded below $2,800. The breakdown sent roughly $2 billion of positions into liquidation, knocking confidence and prompting quick losses across major tokens. Related Reading: XRP Supply Shock Ahead? ETFs Could Consume It All, Analyst Predicts Heavy Liquidations Rock Traders Reports show more than 390,000 accounts were wiped out during the move. One single BTCUSD order on Hyperliquid stood out at $37 million, a sign of how fierce the selling became. Bitcoin bore the brunt: about $962 million of BTC positions were erased within 24 hours, with long bets making up nearly $931 million of that total. These figures underline how concentrated the damage was among those betting on higher prices. Long Positions Versus Shorts Long liquidations across the market approached $1.78 billion, while short liquidations were much smaller at close to $130 million. A rapid shift followed a strong US jobs report, which removed odds of a December rate cut and triggered roughly $450 million in liquidations in just two hours. That macro surprise appears to have fed directly into traders’ risk management systems. Options Expiry Raises Stakes Derivatives activity added pressure as more than $4.2 billion of crypto options were due to expire that day. Over 39,000 BTC options, valued near $3.4 billion, were on the docket. The longer-term put-call ratio sat at 0.52, but heavy recent put buying pushed the 24-hour ratio up to 1.36, signaling a burst of hedging. The so-called max pain level for Bitcoin was around $98,000, well above where spot trades were happening. Ether options also featured prominently, with more than 185,000 contracts worth close to $525 million set to lapse. ETH’s 24-hour put-call moved to 1.01 from 0.72, and the options market’s max pain rested near $3,200, above spot prices near $2,800. Altcoins Felt The Impact The rout spread fast. Solana dropped 11% to about $126, while XRP slid more than 8% to roughly $1.91. Other tokens that fell in the wave included ASTER, HYPE, TNSR, DOGE, and ZEC. Selling was broad, showing that the move was not limited to one market or sector. #PeckShieldAlert Following $ETH‘s drop below $2,900, a whale (0x3ee3…42a6) was liquidated on their long $wstETH position.

    "body": "In what could soon be recognized as the worst-performing week since November 2022, the market’s leading crypto, Bitcoin (BTC), experienced a significant downturn on Friday, plummeting to an eight-month low of $80,000. Market analysts suggest that this downturn began in earnest on October 10, when the market first exhibited signs of a downward trajectory. That day was marked by a brutal liquidation event, erasing nearly $21 billion within minutes and triggering a series of flash crashes that have since perpetuated fears throughout the industry. Digital Asset Treasuries At Risk? Ran Neuner, the founder of Crypto Banter, believes he has uncovered the reasons behind the crash that commenced on October 10 and why the market has struggled to regain its footing since then. Related Reading: Saylor’s Strategy Under Threat: Index Status At Risk With $8 Billion On The Line According to Neuner, two primary players known as Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), including firms like Strategy (MSTR) and others, have been significant buyers driving this market cycle. The objective for these firms is straightforward: to become large enough to gain entry into major indices. Once included, passive index trackers are compelled to purchase large quantities of their stocks, thereby enabling these companies to grow even larger and secure placements in additional indices, thus perpetuating a self-reinforcing cycle. On October 10, MSCI, the world’s second-largest index company, announced a critical evaluation. They are questioning whether companies that primarily hold crypto assets should be classified as either “companies” or “funds.” If these firms are categorized as funds, they would no longer qualify for inclusion in passive indexing. This is crucial because funds follow a cyclical pattern: they acquire assets, grow larger, and become eligible for additional indices, further boosting their asset base. A ruling on this matter is anticipated on January 15, 2026. Should it favor the classification of these companies as funds, Neuner asserts that firms like Strategy could face automatic removal from all indices. Such a decision would compel pension funds and other passive index holders to divest from these companies, effectively diminishing one of their primary reasons for existence. The Future Of Crypto Hinges On Upcoming Ruling Given that DATs have underpinned the current market cycle through substantial purchasing pressure, investors apparently recognized the implications of the October 10 announcement right away and adjusted their positions accordingly. This pivotal date now appears anything but coincidental; it marked a realization among informed market participants regarding significant risks to both cryptocurrencies and the existing market structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Market Confirmed? Expert Predicts Price Target Of $40,000 By Late 2026 Looking ahead, the expert predicts that the market could continue to decline until the end of December. If the forthcoming announcement from MSCI is unfavorable, Neuner believes that a substantial sell-off may ensue as investors prepare for the potential exclusion from indices. Conversely, if the ruling is positive, Neuner asserts that it could signal a renewed bull market for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. As of this writing, Bitcoin has slightly recovered to $84,880. However, the market’s leading cryptocurrency is trading 32% below its all-time high of $126,000, which was reached at the beginning of October—just four days before the major crash.

    "title": "USDC Floods Exchanges: Are Traders Buying The Bitcoin Crash?",
    "body": "On-chain data shows a large amount of USDC inflows have just hit exchanges, a potential sign that investors are looking to buy the Bitcoin dip. USDC Exchange Inflow Has Registered Multiple Spikes Recently As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the USDC Exchange Inflow has shot up recently. The “Exchange Inflow” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of a given asset that’s being transferred to wallets connected with centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Retraces To Lower Bound—What Comes Next? Generally, investors deposit their coins to these platforms when they want to trade them away. As such, whenever the Exchange Inflow spikes, it can be a sign that there is demand for selling the asset. Such a trend can naturally be bearish for Bitcoin and other volatile cryptocurrencies. When it comes to stablecoins, however, trading has no effect on their price, as they are, by definition, stable around the fiat currency that they are pegged to. This doesn’t mean that stablecoin exchange deposits are without consequences, though. Investors usually store their capital in the form of USDC or another stablecoin when they want to avoid the volatility associated with Bitcoin and company. Once these traders feel the time is right to buy back in, they send their stables to exchanges and swap to the asset of their choice. As such, stablecoin inflows can actually be a bullish sign for the market. From the chart shared by Maartunn, it’s visible that the USDC Exchange Inflow has surged recently, a potential sign that fresh capital is looking to accumulate the volatile coins. The latest wave of USDC exchange deposits have arrived as Bitcoin and other digital assets have gone through a crash. Given this timing, it’s possible that traders are buying the dip. In some other news, the recent bearish price action has been especially hard on the short-term holders (STHs), as Glassnode analyst Chris Beamish has pointed out in an X post. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STHs have witnessed a plunge in their Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) alongside the market downturn. STHs are the investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days, and the asset is currently trading at levels notably below any seen during this window, so the entire cohort has dropped into a state of loss. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Dominated By US Selling, CryptoQuant Data Shows Since the recent downtrend has been quite steep, the degree of unrealized loss faced by the cohort has also been unlike anything witnessed since November 2022, when the last bear market reached its bottom. “STH are seriously feeling the pain,” noted Beamish. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly slipped below $81,000 earlier in the day, but it has since seen a small jump back to $83,900.

    "title": "Crypto Funds Face Third Consecutive Weekly Losses, Totaling $3 Billion In Outflows",
    "body": "Recent commentary from the Kobeissi Letter has underscored a troubling trend in the capital markets: crypto-focused funds have encountered substantial outflows, with a notable $2 billion exiting last week alone. This marks the most significant withdrawal since February and extends a concerning streak, bringing total outflows to $3.2 billion over the last three weeks. Bitcoin And Ethereum Face Massive Withdrawals Leading these outflows is the market’s leading crypto, Bitcoin (BTC), which experienced a massive $1.4 billion in withdrawals, while the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), followed closely with $689 million. As a result of these dynamics, the average daily outflows as a percentage of assets under management (AuM) have reached unprecedented levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Market Confirmed? Expert Predicts Price Target Of $40,000 By Late 2026 The cumulative impact of these outflows, coupled with declining prices, has led to a 27% reduction in total assets under management, now standing at $191 billion, a situation that the Kobeissi Letter has termed a “structural decline.” Market sentiment remains largely negative, particularly for Bitcoin, with expert Lark Davis examining current trends through the lens of key moving averages. Davis pointed out that as long as Bitcoin trades below the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), currently placed just above the $10,000 mark, it remains in a bear market. He questioned whether the current downturn signifies a “big bear,” hinting at skepticism regarding recovery prospects, or a “mini bear,” reminiscent of April’s decline where Bitcoin, despite losing the 200-day EMA, did not breach the 50-week EMA. Davis proposed three possible scenarios for the coming weeks. The first posits a drastic descent into “goblin town” without recovery, which he considers unlikely given current oversold conditions. The second scenario involves a short-term rally that tests the 50-week EMA, potentially luring investors back before a sharp downturn. The third scenario, which Davis leans towards, suggests that Bitcoin could reclaim the 50-week EMA by year-end, fueled by easing macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates and market valuations. Crypto Market Turmoil Intensifies Compounding these market concerns is the precarious situation of Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, headed by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor. Jacob King, CEO of SwanDesk, remarked that should Bitcoin fall a few more percentage points, specifically below Strategy’s average buy at just below $80,000, the firm would find itself in a precarious position with its Bitcoin holdings. King fears that forced liquidations could occur again for crypto investors, which could drive Bitcoin prices down toward $10,000 or lower due to increased selling pressure. Related Reading: Saylor’s Strategy Under Threat: Index Status At Risk With $8 Billion On The Line King’s commentary reflects a broader skepticism regarding the sustainability of the crypto market’s structure. He criticized the investment strategies surrounding Bitcoin as being propped up by “unsustainable fraud and hopium.” Highlighting past statements by Saylor, King recalled when Saylor encouraged extreme measures—such as taking out double mortgages and selling personal assets—to invest in Bitcoin, asserting that the current market turmoil should come as no surprise. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $84,700, over 30% below all-time high levels of $126,000 reached earlier in October. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Analyst Says It’s Time To Rethink Altcoins And Alt Season Expectations – Here’s Why",
    "body": "As the market bleeds red and most altcoins lose crucial levels, some have suggested that investors must reshape their expectations of the crypto market this cycle and the long-awaited “alt season.” Related Reading: BitMine’s Unrealized Losses Hit $3.7B As Ethereum (ETH) Price Struggles Below $3,000 Old Crypto Cycle Is Gone – Analyst Over the past month, the crypto market has wiped out over $1 trillion in market capitalization due to a series of large-scale liquidations and strong selling pressure since the October 10 pullback, which has sunk investors’ sentiment to its lowest levels in months. Amid this performance, the early Q4 rally buzz has faded, and most altcoins have lost the ground gained during the Q3 market breakout. Market observers have shared their outlook on how the crypto market has changed and what to expect in the future. In October, Nic Carter, crypto investor and partner at Castle Island Ventures, weighed in on the shift in retail sentiment regarding most altcoins. As reported by NewsBTC, he affirmed that the bearish sentiment means the space has matured significantly. Carter explained that crypto is “boring” now because most of the uncertainties that drove much of the historical volatility have been resolved, adding that the industry has also largely derisked as a technological substrate. The investor considers that “crypto natives no longer control the narrative, there’s more serious businesses (which don’t require tokens), there’s less chaos, the whole space has matured significantly.” In a Friday thread on X, the Altcoin Sherpa also discussed the market changes, affirming that the “old cycles” have been “dead” for a while. As he explained, the previous cycles consisted of an euphoric phase, a corrective phase, and an accumulation phase before the start of a recovery phase. He highlighted the performance of Altcoins like Solana (SOL) between 2020 and 2024, noting that “this market environment is gone.” Instead, the analyst believes that the market is in a “hyper-accelerated regime.” Altcoins In A ‘Hyper-Accelerated Regime’ Under this new regime, the market experiences short-term uptrends followed by mid-term downtrends, similar to the price action of altcoins like BONK since late 2023, Altcoin Sherpa added: We have 1-3 months of pump followed by 2-6 months of downtrend and rinse repeat. There is no more euphoria where things go berserk for an entire year. Just 1-3 months and then down. Look how many cycles BONK had in a year or 2. The analyst suggested that investors should not expect 2021 conditions for most altcoins or a traditional “Alt Season,” where most tokens experience massive gains at once. He advised to capitalize when the “good times” arrive and be aware that “price can still die in 3 months.” “Reframe your brain in how you think about alt pumps and ‘alt season’. Coins will still downtrend, just not in a slow bleed. More [of] an accelerated destruction + carnage, Altcoin Sherpa detailed. Related Reading: This Altcoin Soars 20% In One Day Following Major Saudi Arabia Partnership He also noted that, unlike previous cycles, altcoins will also recover “a bit quicker than before,” and won’t take over a year to bottom and accumulate before a new leg up begins again. However, Sherpa affirmed that the lack of an accumulation phase will mean that “the overall coins will NOT have as strong of pumps like they used to,” as that period is what makes the rallies strong. “We aren’t seeing anything close to that anymore,” he concluded.

    "title": "Buckle Up, Bitcoin ETF Buyers, $79K Might Be Your First Real Test",
    "body": "The cryptocurrency market has been under severe bearish pressure in the past week, with the price of Bitcoin falling below this year’s opening price. At the same time, other large-cap assets have struggled, registering double-digit losses over the past few days. In recent months, conversations have swirled around the death of the typical four-year cycle and a shift in the Bitcoin market structure, with the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) providing fresh, consistent liquidity. However, the latest on-chain data shows that BTC ETF investors could be under pressure in the coming days. $79,300: The Pain Threshold For BTC ETF Buyers In a recent post on the CryptoQuant platform, IT Tech shared an insight into the current Bitcoin market dynamics and how it could affect the relatively new set of investors known as BTC ETF buyers. According to the on-chain analyst, these exchange-traded fund holders are “about to face their first real test.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows A Clear Momentum Reset — Is A Trend Reversal Coming? The relevant metric here is the Bitcoin US ETF Realized Price, which tracks the average purchase price of BTC held by United States-based exchange-traded funds. This indicator offers insights into the profitability of institutional investors and holders. IT Tech, however, made an interesting assertion, calling out the idea that ETF capital inflows are “Institutional Money.” The crypto analyst noted that most value added through US-based exchange-traded funds is mostly from retail investors buying through their brokerage accounts. As observed in the chart above, the Bitcoin US Exchange-Traded Funds Realized Price currently stands around $79,300. IT Tech said that the ETF buyers often feel “smart” when above the realized price, while they feel panic (as seen with most retail investors) when below their cost basis. According to the on-chain analyst, these ETF investors are not accustomed to Bitcoin price declines. Hence, this group of exchange-traded fund holders or “new retail,” who have not been tested before, could enter a phase of panic selling should they go underwater. Currently, the next significant support for the market leader is marked at around $82,000, where several spot investors have their cost basis. Ultimately, this evaluation makes $79,300 another crucial level to watch should the price of Bitcoin suffer further downturn. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $84,500, reflecting an over 2% decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency is down by more than 11% in the past week. Related Reading: Who’s Selling?

    "title": "Bitcoin Investors Sitting On Deep Unrealized Losses — What This Means For Price",
    "body": "The price of Bitcoin has continued to struggle in the final quarter of the year, recently slipping beneath the 2025 starting point. According to the latest on-chain data, investors are currently sitting on deep unrealized losses, which suggests more pain for the market. STHs Sit On Heavy Losses Through Market Crash In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, online crypto pundit Crazzyblockk revealed that specific classes of Bitcoin investors are holding through worrying amounts of losses. This evaluation is based on the Age-Band Unrealized PnL Distribution metric, which shows the amount of profit or loss different classes of Bitcoin holders (sorted by age of coins held) are yet to realize. Related Reading: Saylor’s Strategy Under Threat: Index Status At Risk With $8 Billion On The Line According to Crazzyblockk, Bitcoin’s latest investors, who have held between a day and a week, are facing significant unrealized losses. Meanwhile, recent funders with a slightly broader maturity bracket (1-day to 1-month) are not exempt from the current market heat. Additionally, short-term holders who have been involved for up to six months are also experiencing significant drawdowns, as the Bitcoin price stands far beneath their cost basis. In the Quicktake post, Crazzyblockk highlighted that when investor groups face these high amounts of unrealized losses, any price recovery stands as a source of exit liquidity. This is because crypto investors tend to exit the market under minimal losses, or at breakeven. As a result, the classic ‘Support Becoming Resistance’ phenomenon would continue to play out, as these investors keep exiting just beneath or at their cost basis. However, the verdict is not totally grim for the Bitcoin price, as the analyst explained. While the BTC market evidently leans towards a bearish structure, short-term holder behavior will play an important role in determining its direction in the coming days. Crazyyblockk explained, based on historical data, that if the short-term investors avoid capitulating at roughly 20 – 30% unrealized losses, the flagship cryptocurrency could avoid the deep reset associated with a full-blown bear market. On the flip side, a series of capitulation events among this investor cohort could cause a deep extension of Bitcoin’s crash, as these exits add more momentum to the already existing bearish pressure. And until this investor group is fully wiped out of the market, the price of Bitcoin could continue the current descent. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at around $84,530, reflecting a 4% decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is down by more than 11% in the past week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows A Clear Momentum Reset — Is A Trend Reversal Coming?

    "title": "Pundit Reveals Why XRP Price At $1,000 Is Not A Dream – ‘It’s Math’",
    "body": "A crypto pundit has ignited discussion about the long-term outlook of the XRP price after arguing that a surge to a $1,000 target is not a dream but a realistic goal supported by market math. The analyst believes that XRP’s future depends on measurable utility rather than market hype, positioning the cryptocurrency as an asset built for deep financial integration, which could fuel a prolonged upward rally. Why A $1,000 XRP Price Is Not A Dream Pseudonymous crypto analyst 24HRSCRYPTO predicted on X this Friday that XRP could climb from its current price of above $1.9 to $1,000. He described the path to this ambitious target as a matter of scaling rather than a dream. He also framed it as a math-based outcome, essentially driven by XRP’s foundational role as a global payments currency. Related Reading: Analyst Claims XRP Price Will Surge To $220 Due To ETFs, But Is This Possible? The analyst noted that XRP’s upside potential is more closely tied to real financial infrastructure than to short-lived speculation-driven appreciation. He emphasized that investors often overlook the role of utility, global settlement demands, and deep liquidity, which he believes are the backbone of XRP’s trajectory. These factors set XRP apart from other cryptocurrencies that mainly depend on traders buying at consistently rising prices. 24HRSCRYPTO uses a simple comparison to illustrate the difference that drives cryptocurrency prices. In his view, the Bitcoin price reaches new all-time highs primarily through speculation, while XRP grows through real financial activity supported by its innovative technology. According to the analyst, this disparity is why he believes patience and consistency matter more than hype cycles. The analyst also insists that XRP’s design positions it for long-term use in financial infrastructure where trillions of dollars flow, creating steady demand. He explained that even a modest investment of $5,000 held with discipline until 2030 can grow when supported by real value. This bullish scenario puts a $100 target for XRP within reach as global settlement usage increases. The same logic also supports the analyst’s bold $1,000 price projection. XRP Technical Analysis Signals Growing Strength The XRP price has been dragged down amid the broader market slump, recently crashing to new lows below $2. Despite the altcoin’s weak price action, analysts still hold out hope for a potential market shift to the upside. Related Reading: Analyst Claims XRP Will Flip Bitcoin As These Developments Play Out In a recent technical analysis, crypto market expert Rose Premium Signals notes that XRP has tapped the same demand zone for the third time, creating a strong triple bottom on the weekly timeframe. The analyst’s chart shows that each time the price returns to the $1.8 to $1.9 demand zone, it triggers strong buying. This repeated pattern confirms the formation of a triple bottom, which she considers a classic high-timeframe reversal signal. The chart also reveals that XRP’s recent downtrend has been controlled and met by a well-defended support level. Rose Premium Signals emphasized that each bounce from this support area has triggered progressively stronger reactions. If momentum is confirmed, she predicts that XRP could surge above $3 in the mid-term. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "The cryptocurrency market continues to bleed, with the total market cap now hovering around $2.89 trillion. Zcash (ZEC), one of the privacy tokens daring to defy the fearful market sentiment, has experienced a steady, choppy price action as market forces struggle to establish control. Interestingly, a prominent market analyst with the X username PlanD has discovered significant bearish potential on the horizon. Related Reading: Why is Zcash Surging? Analysts Break Down the ZEC Rally and What Comes Next Zcash To Fall To $281 – Is The Party Over? Despite its performance amid the general crypto market correction, Zcash struggles to break past a formidable barrier in the $750 price zone. In the last week, the privacy coin experienced this rejection in the two instances it climbed above the $700 price mark. According to PlanD, ZEC’s multiple rejections are also threatening the viability of an ascending channel that began in October. Notably, Zcash has broken below the lower boundary of this channel at $672, in successive moments, signaling increasing bearish pressure and weakening upward structure. If the market bears assume a dominant hand of the privacy coin, PlanD is projecting a price crash to around $281, indicating a potential 50% price loss from the present market prices. PlanD’s prediction is similar to that by fellow analyst Ali Martinez, who has since tipped ZEC could correct to around $325, following its struggles at the $750 price zone. However, while technical indicators point to an impending price collapse, strong fundamental developments provide bullishness for a continuous price uptrend. These include institutional endorsements as Cypherpunk Technologies, backed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, which has recently launched a $50 million Zcash treasury strategy. Furthermore, the upcoming Zcash halving event, slated for November 28, adds another layer of bullish undertone as an increase in token scarcity is expected to drive demand pressure and subsequently boost prices.

Meanwhile, daily trading volume is down by 6.1% and valued at $2.24 billion. Nevertheless, ZEC’s monthly performance stands at a staggering 99.41% representing the coin’s defying bullish performance during a time when the total crypto market cap has reduced by 28%. In the last year alone, the privacy coin has surged by 928%, highlighting a remarkable and sustained bullish trajectory. With a market cap of $7.8 billion, ZEC now ranks as the 13th largest cryptocurrency in the world. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from Tradingview",
