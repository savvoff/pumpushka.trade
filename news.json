    "title": "Ripple Exec Reveals Why The Bitcoin Price Is So High Now",
    "body": "Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, has provided a clear explanation for why the Bitcoin price remains so high, currently the most expensive cryptocurrency on the market. Notably, Schwartz’s statement had sparked new discussions across the crypto community. His remarks focused on how people view and use BTC in transactions, revealing a simple economic truth that helps explain the market’s continued confidence in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Ripple CTO Explains Logic Behind Elevated Bitcoin Price On Tuesday, Schwartz shared his thoughts on X, offering a simple but insightful explanation for Bitcoin’s current price strength. Responding to a community member’s question about why anyone would spend BTC given its potential for future appreciation, Schwartz explained that the reason lies in the asset’s perceived value and future expectations. Related Reading: Why Did The Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Crash On October 10 And Will It Happen Again? According to the Ripple CTO, when individuals use Bitcoin to pay for goods or services, they are essentially realizing the full expected value of its future growth today. Rather than holding Bitcoin as a long-term investment and waiting for price gains, these users convert its potential into immediate utility. This behavior, he noted, reflects a broader belief in BTC’s enduring value and is one of the primary reasons why the cryptocurrency’s price remains so high. Notably, Schwartz’s remarks followed a conversation that began when Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Square, a business technology company, announced that Bitcoin payments had gone live across the firm’s platforms. Dorsey revealed that Square customers can now pay for services and products using Bitcoin directly, and sellers can choose between multiple settlement options, including BTC-to-BTC, BTC-to-fiat, and fiat-to-BTC transactions. Funds received through Bitcoin payments will be automatically stored in a user’s Square wallet, with self-custody transfer limits of up to $15,000 per day or $50,000 per week. Interestingly, the timing of Schwartz’s explanation comes a month after BTC reached a new all-time high of over $126,000. Compared to other digital assets, Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency in the six-figure territory, even surpassing traditional investments like gold and major stock indices. While some analysts argue that Bitcoin is overvalued, many investors remain convinced that it could still climb significantly higher in the long term. Bitcoin Price Expected To Rise Even Higher The Bitcoin price is currently sitting above the $100,000 level, but analysts believe it could rise even further. The leading cryptocurrency is hovering near $103,300, experiencing some volatility, which has triggered a nearly 2% dip in the past 24 hours amid whale capitulations. Crypto analyst Joe Francesco noted that Bitcoin had initially surged to $107,000 following a wave of optimism sparked by US President Donald Trump’s proposed $2,000 stimulus plan. Related Reading: New XRP ETF Just Dropped, But Will Anything Be Different This Time? However, the rally proved short-lived, as BTC fell a few days later. Despite the pullback, Francesco has described the cryptocurrency’s chart setup as positive, predicting that Bitcoin could soon break through $107,000, with the potential to reach $115,000 and even $120,000 if upward momentum continues.

    "title": "Abundance of Catalysts Suggests XRP Price Could Take Off This Week",
    "body": "XRP is entering one of its most crucial weeks in months as a series of bullish catalysts align to set the stage for what could be a breakout move. The token has held firmly above the $2.20 support zone despite the recent market crash, and both technical and fundamental factors now point toward a possible surge in price. According to crypto analyst Guy on the Earth, XRP is in a make-or-break moment, with abundant news catalysts giving traders reasons to stay optimistic about the short-term direction. XRP Holds $2.20 Support; Analyst Eyes Resistance Ahead “Another reversal from lows as XRP holds onto the $2.20 support,” said Guy on the Earth in a recent post on X, capturing the cautious positiveness in the price of XRP. He noted that the token is currently slap bang mid-range, targeting a retest of the $2.63 to $2.72 resistance zone. Related Reading: The XRP Price Is About To Do This In November – “Get Ready” According to him, there is an abundance of positive catalysts this week, ranging from ETF speculation to the end of the ongoing government shutdown. These catalysts are very important, as XRP needs a continuation of its momentum bounce from $2.2 to target the next resistance from here; otherwise, this is a dead cat at best. The analyst emphasized that XRP’s ability to defend its key support levels will be critical in shaping its near-term trajectory. He warned that if the token revisits the $2.20 range, it may struggle to hold that level again, potentially slipping to between $1.90 and $2.00. Despite this caution, he maintained his conviction that the recent lows are already in and that XRP is gradually preparing for a range breakout to the upside. “Things are coming together for the rally we’ve been looking for,” he added, while noting that chopping around this zone is healthy before a break of the range higher. ETF Anticipation Builds Momentum For XRP A large part of this week’s optimism surrounding XRP is tied to growing speculation that a US-listed exchange-traded fund could be nearing approval. Canary Capital’s recent Form 8-A submission to the US Securities and Exchange Commission has increased expectations that the long-discussed spot XRP ETF might debut soon, possibly under the ticker “XRPC.” Related Reading: XRP Price Performance In November: History Says It’s The Most Bullish Month In History The anticipation surrounding this ETF has already begun shaping market sentiment, reflected in the steady stream of excitement from XRP supporters across social media. Traders are drawing comparisons to the rallies seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum following their respective ETF approvals, anticipating a similar influx of institutional demand if XRP’s turn arrives. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.41, a 2% dip in the past 24 hours. Maintaining the $2.20 support remains the key technical objective for bulls, as holding that level could pave the way for another attempt at the $2.72 resistance zone in the next few days.

    "title": "Bitcoin’s Historical Liquidity Indicator Just Lit Up — Big Move Incoming?",
    "body": "According to an analyst, Bitcoin sits in a liquidity set-up that has shown up before big rallies. Prices are not shooting higher yet. At press time Bitcoin trades around $104,500, down 0.5% over the past day. Related Reading: XRP’s Next ‘Face-Melting’ Rally Could Hit Within 6 Weeks—Analyst Traders watched a decline of about 1.8% earlier that pushed the price near $103,400 and it briefly touched $102,850 during the move. Stablecoin Signal Points Toward Accumulation CryptoQuant analyst Moreno points to the Stablecoin Supply Ratio, or SSR, as the first clear indicator. The SSR compares Bitcoin’s market cap to the total market cap of stablecoins. It has dropped back into the 13 range. Based on historical readings, that 13 area has lined up with market lows in mid-2021 and at several moments across 2024. Reports show that when SSR fell to similar levels, liquidity quietly built up and buying followed after a period of low volatility. Liquidity Pattern Has Appeared Before Every Bitcoin Surge — And It’s Back “We’re witnessing a liquidity configuration that has only appeared a handful of times since 2020, and each instance marked a pivotal moment for Bitcoin’s trajectory.” – By @MorenoDV_ pic.twitter.com/vWKcCkyn55 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 11, 2025 Binance Reserve Trends Add A Second Layer The second metric Moreno highlights comes from Binance. On that exchange, stablecoin balances are rising while Bitcoin reserves are shrinking. In plain terms: more cash-like tokens sit on the exchange and fewer coins are being held there. That pattern has appeared only a handful of times since 2020, according to the data he referenced. Each time, the movement suggested capital waiting on the sidelines and holders moving coins off exchanges into longer-term storage. Market Calm Can Hide Big Moves The current trading backdrop is cautious. Many investors expected a lift after news that the US Congress approved short-term federal funding through January 30, yet crypto did not rally with other risk assets. Some capital rotated back to stocks. At the same time, large holders took profits after recent highs, and momentum cooled. That mix shows how macro events can shift flows without immediately turning into crypto buying. Risk Still Exists — Structure Could Break Moreno warns this liquidity zone acts like a final structural support. If the metrics break down decisively, it could signal a deeper reset before any sustained recovery. In that scenario, buying would likely be delayed and volatility would rise. This is not a guaranteed outcome, but it is a clear risk that traders watch closely. Outlook: Limited Downside, Growing Upside Based on reports and on-chain signals, Moreno believes the risk-to-reward favors buyers at these levels. He points to the built-up stablecoin supply and falling exchange BTC reserves as reasons for that view. Related Reading: Could Shiba Inu Triple? Analyst Sees 200% Move Coming Historical patterns suggest the last three months of the year often bring gains for Bitcoin, but past behavior does not promise future returns. For now, the indicators show capital parked in stablecoins and fewer coins available on major exchanges. That creates a setup where fresh buying could push the market higher quickly if sentiment turns. Yet the opposite is possible: a break below these levels would reshape the cycle and force many participants to rethink positions. Markets will decide which path comes next.

    "body": "Uniswap (UNI) has sparked a storm across DeFi after founder Hayden Adams unveiled the long-awaited “UNIfication” proposal, a sweeping governance overhaul that introduces protocol fees, a substantial $842 million token burn, and a strategic buyback plan. Related Reading: XRP’s Next ‘Face-Melting’ Rally Could Hit Within 6 Weeks—Analyst The move marks Uniswap’s biggest reform since its 2020 token launch, designed to transform UNI from a passive governance token into a deflationary, yield-generating asset. Under the proposal, 0.3% of all trading volume will now be split between liquidity providers (0.25%) and a UNI buyback pool (0.05%), creating continuous demand for the token. With over $1 trillion in annualized trading volume, analysts project roughly $38 million in monthly buybacks, about $450 million annually. Whales Accumulate as Uniswap (UNI) Skyrockets 63% The market reaction was explosive. Uniswap (UNI) surged by over 63% in one week, peaking at $10 before stabilizing around $8.57. On-chain data from Santiment shows rising whale accumulation and a steady increase in UNI held outside of exchanges, indicating long-term investor confidence. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes reportedly purchased $244,000 worth of UNI, joining institutional buyers positioning for a supply shock. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju predicted that if protocol fees remain active, annual burns could exceed $500 million, drastically tightening supply. “Even with unlocks, a UNI supply shock seems inevitable,” Ju noted. The rally also extended to other DeFi assets, such as AAVE, Synthetix, and Compound, as traders speculated that Uniswap’s model could set a new standard for protocol-owned liquidity and value distribution. UNI's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: UNIUSD on Tradingview UNIfication Ushers in the Next Era of DeFi Governance Beyond tokenomics, UNIfication unites Uniswap Labs, the Foundation, and the Unichain L2 network under one ecosystem. The proposal eliminates interface fees, introduces fee discount auctions to enhance LP returns, and compensates governance delegates, turning Uniswap’s decision-making into a professionalized, revenue-sharing system. Adams emphasized that the initiative represents more than a technical upgrade, it’s a cultural shift. “Uniswap can be the primary place tokens are traded globally,” he said. “This proposal ends a restrictive chapter and begins the decade of Uniswap.” Related Reading: Ethereum Ready To Explode To $12,000 By January, Says Tom Lee With UNI up more than 66% this week and investors anticipating formal governance approval, the DeFi giant appears poised to reclaim its dominance as crypto’s flagship decentralized exchange.

    "title": "Ethereum Whale Adds $105M To His ETH Position – $1.33B Bought Since Nov 4",
    "body": "Ethereum has entered a consolidation phase following a turbulent period of selling pressure driven by macroeconomic uncertainty and market fear surrounding the US government shutdown. Over the past week, Ethereum’s price has stabilized around the $3,500 level after briefly dipping below key supports, as traders and institutions reassess risk exposure across the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH-MVRV Rebounds From Local Low – Potential Recovery Toward $115K–$120K Despite the cautious sentiment, on-chain data reveals a contrasting story — large holders, or “whales,” are quietly accumulating ETH during the downturn. According to data from Lookonchain and CryptoQuant, several high-value wallets have increased their Ethereum positions significantly, signaling growing confidence among long-term investors even as broader market momentum slows. This accumulation phase suggests that sophisticated players view current price levels as an opportunity rather than a sign of broader weakness. Historically, similar patterns of whale buying during macro uncertainty have preceded periods of recovery and renewed market strength. Whale Activity Suggests Strategic Accumulation Despite Market Uncertainty According to data from Lookonchain, a whale known for aggressive Ethereum accumulation has just purchased an additional 30,548 ETH ($105.36 million) within the past hour. This move brings his total acquisitions since November 4 to an astonishing 385,718 ETH, worth roughly $1.33 billion. Notably, around $270 million of the funds used for these purchases were borrowed from the decentralized lending platform Aave, highlighting a highly leveraged but strategic positioning. This type of activity often signals strong institutional confidence in Ethereum’s medium-term outlook. Borrowing large sums to accumulate ETH indicates that the whale expects price appreciation substantial enough to offset borrowing costs and volatility risks. It also reflects growing demand for Ethereum exposure within decentralized finance (DeFi), where whales utilize platforms like Aave to optimize capital efficiency. Such large-scale buying can have multiple implications: it absorbs available market liquidity, strengthens psychological support zones, and may trigger a sentiment shift among retail investors who interpret the move as bullish. However, it also introduces potential short-term risk — if prices correct further, leveraged positions could amplify volatility. Overall, the data points toward renewed accumulation momentum, suggesting that sophisticated market participants are positioning for Ethereum’s next major move. Related Reading: Uniswap Founder Submits Governance Proposal To Burn UNI — Token Jumps 50% Bulls Attempt to Reclaim Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is currently showing signs of stabilization after weeks of intense selling pressure, trading around $3,479 at the time of writing. The daily chart shows ETH holding just above the 200-day moving average (red line) — a key long-term support level that has historically acted as a launch point for bullish recoveries. After dipping below $3,200 earlier in the week, Ethereum bounced strongly, supported by renewed whale accumulation and improving market sentiment. However, the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages remain above the current price, indicating that the short-term trend is still tilted to the downside. For bulls to regain control, ETH needs to close decisively above $3,650–$3,700, where a confluence of resistance sits. Related Reading: Ethereum Trading Volume On Binance Surpasses $6 Trillion: A Speculative Frenzy Unfolds Volume data suggests that selling pressure is gradually fading, but momentum remains weak. If Ethereum fails to maintain the $3,400–$3,450 zone, the next major support lies near $3,200. On the upside, reclaiming the $3,700 mark could open the door to a recovery toward $4,000. Overall, Ethereum appears to be in a consolidation phase, with large holders accumulating while retail traders remain cautious — a structure that often precedes a stronger directional move.

Reports point to similar setups in past rallies: in 2017 DOGE moved from about $0.00022 to $0.019 — roughly 9,800% — and in 2021 it climbed from about $0.0025 to $0.75, a surge of over 32,000%. Those runs are the basis for the “fractal confluence” argument that history could repeat. DOGECOIN READY FOR ITS NEXT HISTORIC MEGA RUN 🚀 Breakout ✅ Retest ✅ Structure locked and loaded for a parabolic explosion! The same pattern that sent $DOGE flying in 2017, 2021 is repeating again on the monthly timeframe and this time, the move looks even more powerful.… pic.twitter.com/yZIFHthnm5 — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) November 11, 2025 A Recent Breakout, Retest Highlighted As Trigger Based on reports, DOGE cleared the triangle in December 2024 during a US President Donald Trump-led crypto market boom, pushing above $0.48. The coin then came back to test the former trendline, which some traders call a normal step after a breakout. Other analysts have flagged similarities between today’s action and the token’s early bull runs, and some see that as confirmation for more upside. Short-Term Indicators Looking Up Technical numbers show a nearer-term forecast of a rise of 13.51% to $0.2002 by December 12, 2025. Current readings described by data providers list sentiment as Bearish and the Fear & Greed Index at 20 (Fear). Over the last 30 days DOGE had 13/30 (43%) green days and about 6.71% price volatility. Those numbers suggest that, for now, traders remain cautious even as longer-term charts are cited as bullish. Bitwise DOGE ETF Reports note that Bitwise moved forward with a DOGE ETF filing under Section 8(a) using CF Benchmarks’ settlement price, an action that could draw institutional interest if it progresses.

According to Bitwise, its fund would use the CF DOGE-Dollar Settlement Price from CF Benchmarks to calculate net asset value, which provides transparent, rules-based pricing across venues. If approved, this structure could make DOGE more accessible to institutions needing a regulated vehicle, potentially boosting order book depth and easing inflows or outflows. This increased access, combined with clearer pricing, could explain the recent movements in the market value of DOGE. Featured image from Gemini, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "SEC Chair Sets Out Plans For Crypto Taxonomy To Define Digital Asset Classification",
    "body": "In recent statements made by Chair Paul Atkins, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced a strategic plan targeted at giving much-needed clarity on the classification of crypto assets. Howey Test And Token Taxonomy In Crypto Atkins highlighted the forthcoming consideration of establishing a “token taxonomy” within the Commission, a structured framework rooted in legal rationale to discern between securities and commodities. He emphasized the importance of adhering to “limiting principles” in laws and regulations to ensure a cohesive approach towards crypto asset classification. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Bottom Out In 300 Days: Top Expert Forecasts $38,000 To $50,000 Price Point Atkins commended the efforts of Commissioner Hester Peirce, particularly her work in providing a transparent and economically grounded treatment of crypto assets under federal securities laws. The Chair emphasized three key themes in his address: the significance of a clear token taxonomy, the application of the Howey test in recognizing the temporary nature of investment contracts, and the practical implications for innovators, intermediaries, and investors in the evolving crypto landscape. Addressing the prevalent issue of distinguishing between securities and non-securities in the crypto space, Atkins noted that while most tokens are not inherently securities, certain tokens may have been sold within the context of an investment contract during a securities offering. However, he refuted the notion that every token involved in an investment contract perpetually retains its security status, emphasizing the importance of contextual analysis and recognizing the dynamic nature of investment contracts. Atkins Pledges Support For Evolving Digital Asset Laws In his remarks, Atkins also underscored the challenges faced by developers, exchanges, custodians, and investors in navigating the crypto ecosystem, where tokens serve various functions beyond traditional securities. He criticized the previous administration’s “blanket treatment” of all tokens as securities, highlighting the need for a more nuanced and practical approach to regulation to prevent stifling innovation and driving it offshore. Related Reading: China’s Cybersecurity Agency Alleges US Government Stole $13 Billion In Bitcoin In alignment with ongoing legislative efforts, Atkins reassured that the SEC aims to complement, rather than replace, existing crypto legislative initiatives. He emphasized the agency’s commitment to robust fraud enforcement and the development of clearer regulatory guidelines to ensure the safety of US investors. In closing, Atkins emphasized the importance of forward-looking regulatory practices, rejecting a stagnant approach rooted in fear of change. He reiterated the SEC’s commitment to delineating clear boundaries and providing transparent guidance. The statement concluded: That is what Project Crypto is about. That is what the Commission should be about. And that is the commitment I make to you today as Chairman: we will not let fear of the future trap us in the past.

    "body": "Following the recent comeback of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, Cypherpunk Technologies has launched a $50 million Zcash (ZEC) treasury strategy backed by Winklevoss Capital. Related Reading: SUI Eyes Key Retest As Price Breaks Out Of Downtrend – Rally To $3 Ahead? Cypherpunk Technologies Launches Zcash DAT On Wednesday, Leap Therapeutics announced the official launch of its Zcash Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) strategy and rebrand to Cypherpunk Technologies. The biotech company previously revealed that it had closed a $58.88 million private placement in October, led by Winklevoss Capital, as part of its plan to expand to the digital assets sector. The company currently holds 1.25% of the current ZEC supply after acquiring 203,775 ZEC at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $50 million, or $245.37 per token. Cypherpunk Technologies will reportedly continue to accumulate Zcash to own at least 5% of the total ZEC supply. The Company believes that privacy-protecting assets and related technologies will be critical in an increasingly digital world. The Company intends to acquire and hold ZEC, the native coin of Zcash, as its primary digital asset and to be an active participant in the Zcash community. Douglas E. Onsi, President and CEO of Cypherpunk Technologies, asserted that “This past month has been transformative for the Company, marked by closing a $58.88 million private placement led by Winklevoss Capital and successfully deploying $50 million to build a digital asset treasury designed to create long-term shareholder value focused on active participation in the development of Zcash and acquiring ZEC.” Per the announcement, the company will begin trading on Nasdaq under the new CYPH ticker on Thursday, November 13. Meanwhile, its ongoing cancer research and development operations will continue under a subsidiary that will take the Leap Therapeutics name. Winklevoss Twins Back ‘Encrypted Bitcoin’ In an X post, Gemini’s co-founder, Tyler Winklevoss, explained the reasons behind Winklevoss Capital’s investment in Cypherpunk Technologies, emphasizing the importance of supporting privacy and self-sovereignty in the online era. “Privacy is the precondition for many of our freedoms. It’s the point at which government and corporate reach end and our individual freedoms and self-sovereignty begin. As our lives have moved online, privacy’s become a rare, vanishing commodity,” the post reads. Winklevoss highlighted Zcash’s “highly symbiotic relationship” with Bitcoin since its launch nine years ago, affirming that, “If bitcoin is digital gold, Zcash is encrypted bitcoin, or digital cash.” One is your store of value, the other is how you privately move your value. We’ve been tracking this symbiosis for years and believe that now — as we enter the age of AI — is the right time to begin accumulating ZEC. Gemini’s co-founder also argued that Zcash could capture “a meaningful percentage” of BTC’s market capitalization, which he has predicted will surge to $1 million per BTC over the next 5-10years. Therefore, he believes that “Zcash will appreciate significantly from here as well.” Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Reclaims $3,500 Amid Market Rebound, Analysts Forecast December Take-Off It’s worth noting that Zcash has recorded a parabolic rally since September, surging 1,775% to its all-time high (ATH) of $750 last Friday. Since then, the cryptocurrency has followed the market’s correction, dropping over 40% to the $420 area before recovering. As of this writing, Zcash is trading at $507, a 15% increase in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "United States President Donald Trump late Wednesday signed legislation that ended the country’s 43-day government shutdown, reopening federal agencies and restarting paused services after what had become the longest shutdown in modern history. Reports have disclosed the measure passed both houses this week and moves quickly to restore pay and services. Related Reading: Dogecoin Alert! Price Could Explode Over 2,800%, Analyst Says Funding Push Restores Pay And Services According to official House materials, the measure passed the House by a 222–209 vote and carries continuing appropriations that fund agencies through January 30, 2026. The bill covers several full-year appropriations and aims to return back pay to hundreds of thousands of federal workers who were furloughed or forced to work without pay. President Trump signs bill to OFFICIALLY reopen the government, ending the Democrat Shutdown. Let’s get our country WORKING again. 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/QJqX90k9sC — The White House (@WhiteHouse) November 13, 2025 Markets Liked The Certainty Risk assets jumped as lawmakers moved to end the standoff. Reports have disclosed Bitcoin climbed back toward the $105,000 area after the breakthrough, while broader crypto tokens also showed gains as traders priced in the reduction of fiscal uncertainty. Short, sharp moves in the market reflected traders unwinding defensive positions. Crypto Reaction In Numbers Bitcoin rose from lows near $99,300 earlier in the week to above $105,000 on news of progress, a move that some outlets measured as a roughly 6.7% uptick over recent sessions. Ethereum recovered toward about $3,600 as investors rotated back into riskier assets. These moves came alongside rallies in stocks and other risk markets. Based on reports from market commentators, the end of the shutdown reduced one layer of macro uncertainty. That made it easier for large funds and ETFs to move money without the risk of sudden policy disruption. Some short-term flows into crypto appear tied to renewed confidence that key infrastructure — like air travel and federal programs — will run normally again. Political Fallout And Next Steps Lawmakers from both parties have already signaled new fights ahead, with pressure to address policy items that were left out of the funding package. The White House framed the outcome as a win for governance, while critics said parts of the deal leave important programs and protections unresolved. Related Reading: XRP Has Held Its Ground As Most Altcoins Fall, Market Observers Say Market Watchers Offer Caution While the immediate market reaction was positive, several analysts warned that gains tied to the shutdown’s end could be temporary. Volatility may return if political gridlock reemerges or if technical resistance levels hold for major tokens. The buying seen on the reopening was broad, but not unanimous, and many traders are watching whether flows remain steady into year-end. Featured image from ABC News, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "$30M Manipulation On Hyperliquid: The POPCAT Connection And What You Need To Know",
    "body": "Memecoin POPCAT experienced a significant downturn on Wednesday following a major manipulation event on Hyperliquid (HYPE), one of the leading decentralized exchanges in the cryptocurrency market. POPCAT Faces 43% Drop Following Manipulative Scheme According to a detailed analysis of the situation by DeFi researcher Hanzo on social media site X (previously Twitter), an unknown trader executed a well-coordinated strategy approximately 13 hours prior to the market disruption. The trader withdrew $3 million in USDC from the OKX exchange and distributed the funds across 19 different wallets on Hyperliquid. Subsequently, they initiated sizable long positions on POPCAT, accumulating total exposure estimated between $20 million and $30 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Bottom Out In 300 Days: Top Expert Forecasts $38,000 To $50,000 Price Point To create an illusion of demand for the memecoin, the trader placed a massive buy wall at the price point of $0.21, with orders totaling $30 million lined up on the order book. This artificial façade of high buying interest successfully attracted real traders, prompting them to jump on the bandwagon and increase their own buying activity. However, the situation took a swift turn when the trader removed the buy wall without warning, leading to an instantaneous collapse in the price of POPCAT. This shift resulted in the liquidation of all the long positions taken by traders. The unknown trader lost their $3 million collateral, while Hyperliquid’s HLP system automatically absorbed the open positions. This action triggered an additional loss of approximately $4.9 million to the HLP, exacerbating a broader market selloff across the token. Hyperliquid Faces Third Major Disruption This Year In the wake of the incident, the Hyperliquid team took emergency measures to stabilize the market and close any remaining exposures. Shortly after, the platform paused its Arbitrum (ARB) bridge, although it continued processing deposits and withdrawals normally. The community has expressed skepticism regarding the circumstances surrounding this incident, with many suggesting it may not have been a random liquidation. Instead, some believe the event could resemble a deliberate stress test or an attack aimed at destabilizing Hyperliquid’s liquidity system. Some contend that the rapid loss of millions in such a short time frame seems too calculated to be merely coincidental. Related Reading: China’s Cybersecurity Agency Alleges US Government Stole $13 Billion In Bitcoin This incident marks the third major market disruption on Hyperliquid in 2025, raising serious questions about the exchange’s approach to handling liquidity concentration and its systemic risk management practices, as noted by Hanzo in his analysis. Following the manipulation, the POPCAT memecoin saw a steep decline of approximately 43%, dropping from $0.21 to $0.12, with total liquidations reaching around $63 million. The decentralized exchange’s native token, HYPE, also declined significantly following the event. According to CoinGecko data, it is currently trading at $38.25, which is a 7% decrease on the weekly timeframe. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "The Shiba Inu price and its trajectory over the last few months have been a source of growing concerns for SHIB investors as the meme coin has failed to secure any meaningful recovery. Despite the Bitcoin price rallying, Shiba Inu has remained quite muted, failing to reach new all-time highs through the bull rally. Therefore, with only two months left in the year 2025, the question remains as to whether the Shiba Inu price can still rally to new all-time highs. Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Shiba Inu Price Trajectory The machine learning algorithm at the Coincodex website has shown a trajectory for the Shiba Inu price that suggests that the meme coin is destined for more sideways action this year. The prediction for the new year is that the meme coin will continue to trade in a very tight range. Related Reading: Institutions Have Been Buying Solana Every Day For 2 Weeks, Is $300 Possible? Even with the Shiba Inu price currently trending more than 88% below its all-time high from 2021, the machine learning algorithm does not see it bouncing anytime soon. For the rest of the year, the cryptocurrency is expected to trade under $0.000012. This puts it in the tight range of $0.00001-$0.000012. Interestingly, though, the same way the machine learning algorithm has predicted no increase, there is no expectation of a decline. The trajectory of the SHIB price over the next two months shows an almost straight line, and then continues into the year 2026 in the same manner. When Will SHIB Hit New All-Time Highs? According to the machine learning algorithm, SHIB investors awaiting the meme coin to hit a new all-time high have a long wait ahead of them. The long-term prediction suggests that the Shiba Inu price will not hit a new all-time high in the next decade. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Rally Above $0.74 ATHs In The Works As HTF Trend Holds This long-term prediction moves through the next three decades, going all the way into the year 2050, and yet Sh. For most of the time, the algorithm suggests that the cryptocurrency will only see double-digit growth for each year over the next couple of years. Interestingly, historical data also support muted performance for the Shiba Inu price for the rest of the year. CryptoRank website shows an average return of 0.31% for SHIB for the month of November and -9.84% for the month of December. If these hold, then it means that the SHIB price is more likely to decline than recover as the year moves toward an end. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Best Altcoins to Watch as Solana Whales Start Buying",
    "body": "What to Know: Solana’s order books show renewed whale demand while spot $SOL ETFs log a multi-day inflow streak, reinforcing risk appetite. SoFi’s crypto rollout adds a mainstream on-ramp for US retail, a structural tailwind for altcoin participation. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), Best Wallet Token ($BEST), and SPX6900 ($SPX) align with throughput, utility, and liquidity narratives that typically lead early in rotations. Solana just lit up the order books. Fresh ‘smart money’ buy walls and block-sized prints show whales leaning in, with net spot inflows building across top venues. The flow tells a simple story: big players are scaling bids into weakness and front-running a potential trend shift. The backdrop helps. Spot Solana ETFs have now chalked up 10 straight days of net inflows , a rare streak during a choppy week for majors. That run, led by Bitwise’s $SOL fund, pushes the narrative toward persistent demand and strengthens the case for an alt rotation if risk stabilizes. Retail rails are opening too. SoFi Bank has rolled out in-app crypto trading to its millions of customers, becoming the first nationally chartered US bank to offer crypto buying and selling – with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana at the forefront. Easier fiat on-ramps plus ETF flows and whale accumulation is the kind of three-piece puzzle that often precedes a broader alt rally. With that macro tailwind in mind, three tokens stand out due to their fundamentals and timing – two presales riding clear narratives and one listed memecoin with heavyweight liquidity. It’s a focused watchlist for anyone scouting the best altcoins to watch into the year-end. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – BTC L2 Built With SVM Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) takes a direct swing at the oldest pain point in crypto: slow and expensive $BTC transactions that negatively impact the ecosystem’s scalability. The design funnels transactions to a Bitcoin-settled Layer 2 and uses the Solana Virtual Machine for high throughput execution. The result aims for near-instant finality, ZK-assisted validity, and periodic L1 commitments to keep security anchored to Bitcoin. That’s serious design space for payments, dApps and even meme coins, with $BTC as the settlement bedrock. If $SOL ETF inflows are a proxy for demand for high-speed chains, then a Bitcoin-secured L2 using SVM could capture overflow interest from developers and traders looking for $BTC-native performance. Timing and numbers matter in presales. The token is priced at $0.013265 with the presale sitting at $26.99M raised. Based on the presale’s performance and Hyper’s utility proposition, a realistic price prediction for $HYPER puts it at $0.08625 by the end of 2026 and $0.253 by 2030. From today’s prices, these numbers translate into an ROI of 550% and 1,807% respectively. Given that Hyper targets a Q4 2025 – Q1 2026 release window, the earlier you join the $HYPER train, the better. Make sure you read our guide on how to buy $HYPER first. Visit the official presale page and buy your $HYPER today. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Utility-First Wallet Ecosystem Token $BEST is the native token for Best Wallet , a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet aiming to turn power-user features into default settings. Think cross-chain swaps via an autorouter across 300+ DEXs and 30 bridges, MPC security without seed phrases, real-world spending with the upcoming crypto card, and a token launchpad baked into the app. The token links to fee reductions, access, and ecosystem rewards across features that already map to daily crypto usage. Presale mechanics are straightforward. The token is live at $0.025935 with more than $17M raised. Our price prediction for $BEST outlines a potential 2026 high near $0.05106175, representing 96% gains. For a wallet token, utility density is the tell – on-ramp integrations, multi-chain coverage, and soon, in-app staking partners build a clear reason to hold through volatility. The tie-in to today’s flow: SoFi’s crypto rollout and $SOL ETF traction could nudge casual users to seek simple, secure self-custody with swap and bridge UX done right. $BEST plugs that gap natively. If you want in, make sure you read our guide on how to buy $BEST first. Then visit the presale page and buy your $BEST today. 3. SPX6900 ($SPX) – Meme Liquidity With Big-Cap Exchange Reach SPX6900 ($SPX) is a culture-driven meme asset with multi-chain reach and a simple message: internet-scale community meets exchange-grade liquidity. The token’s market cap sits above $615M, with $SPX sitting at $0.6609. As attention rotates, high-beta meme names with deep order books often act as liquidity barometers. They move first, they move fast, and they draw flow. Crucially, $SPX trades on Coinbase , which tends to boost retail access and tightens spreads for US users. That exchange reach matters when volatility returns and users want instant fills on familiar apps. Recent Coinbase pages and converters reflect live SPX markets and volumes on the platform, while aggregators show additional venues and pairs. If ETF and banking rails keep onboarding newcomers, liquid memes like $SPX can catch outsized bursts. And talking about bursts, $SPX showcases an all-time ROI of 25M%, which is literally a wealth-building performance. So, go to your favorite exchange and buy your $SPX today. Recap: Whales are scaling into $SOL, spot ETFs keep stacking inflows, and SoFi’s launch opens a bank-grade retail door. In that setup, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , and SPX6900 ($SPX) each tap a live narrative – $BTC-secured speed, wallet-centric utility, and meme liquidity with top exchange access. This isn’t financial advice. Do your own research before investing. Authored by Aaron Walker, NewsBTC: www.newsbtc.com/news/best-altcoins-to-watch-as-solana-whales-start-accumulating",

The $HYPER presale is nearing $27M raised, signaling strong interest ahead of mainnet milestones and initial listings. Using the current $0.013265 price, our forecast for $HYPER goes to a 1.9x high in 2025 and 6.5x in 2026 if roadmaps land. Bitcoin still moves like a freight train: unstoppable over distance, painfully slow up close. Block space is scarce, fees spike when demand pops, and native programmability is minimal. That leaves everyday payments clunky and DeFi on Bitcoin mostly stitched together with workarounds. Those constraints are tolerable for a store-of-value narrative. They’re a drag on mainstream utility. For reference, Bitcoin ranks 22nd among the fastest blockchains by TPS, which is far below industry standards. Solana ranks second on the same list. Layer-2 solutions are the obvious release valve. Payment channels handle throughput but struggle with complex logic and liquidity routing. Sidechains help, then trade off security assumptions. The real unlock is an L2 that processes high-throughput transactions and settles back to L1 with strong guarantees. Builders get speed and programmability. Users get cheaper, near-instant finality without abandoning the Bitcoin security umbrella. This is the gap Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is trying to close. The project proposes an L2 architecture that batches transactions, uses zero-knowledge proofs for validity, and periodically commits state to Bitcoin. Execution rides on a Solana-style virtual machine for throughput, with a canonical bridge to move $BTC in and out trustlessly. If it ships as planned, the stack aims to make Bitcoin programmable at scale – fast payments, convenient on-chain trading with staking flows, and full DeFi rails tied back to $BTC. Macro doesn’t hurt either. With Bitcoin hovering near cycle highs this year and institutional demand sticky, anything that expands $BTC’s utility surface tends to catch flows. A credible L2 narrative aligned to Bitcoin’s brand strength has a shot at outsized attention. Bitcoin Hyper: Solana-Speed Execution Meets Bitcoin-Grade Settlement Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) blueprint starts with a canonical bridge that verifies Bitcoin block headers and transaction proofs, then mints equivalent assets on the L2. The execution layer uses an SVM-compatible environment to push throughput while fees stay low. Hyper batches transactions, proven with ZK cryptography, and anchors the resulting state roots to Bitcoin for settlement. Withdrawals reverse the path and release $BTC on L1 after proof validation. The design targets three user wins: speed, cost, and programmability – without straying from Bitcoin’s security philosophy. If executed, this architecture invites real apps. Payments clear in seconds. Orderbooks and automated market markers operate without gas anxiety. Yield farming and structured products become feasible for $BTC holders who never wanted to leave the Bitcoin orbit. Developer momentum matters here: an SVM toolchain lowers friction for teams already fluent in that ecosystem, while $BTC settlement keeps the conservative crowd onside. That mix – familiar dev experience plus Bitcoin trust – is the project’s most pragmatic wedge. Competition exists. Lightning remains the OG for peer-to-peer payments. Other Bitcoin-adjacent stacks chase programmability with different compromises. But none of them offer the comprehensive solution that Hyper confidently pitches. Thinking about joining the ecosystem? Learn more about what Bitcoin Hyper does . Bitcoin Hyper is cleaner: keep settlement on Bitcoin, use a high-throughput Solana VM for execution, and prove correctness before committing. In a market where latency and user costs decide winners, that’s a sensible bet. Visit $HYPER’s website for more. Hyper’s Presale Economics and Realistic Upside Potential Momentum is there. The $HYPER presale is now at $26.99M, supported by a run of larger buys as the cycle grinds higher. That’s sizable traction for an early-stage L2 with a technical roadmap and a clear narrative tied to Bitcoin’s growth, which recommends $HYPER as one of the top crypto presales of 2025. The token price is now sitting at $0.013265 per $HYPER, with staking rewards at 43% . From that base, our price prediction for $HYPER maps two checkpoints: a potential 2025 high at $0.02595 if initial listings and early dApps land on schedule, and a 2026 high at $0.08625 if incentives and governance broaden participation. At today’s price, that implies 1.9x growth potential in late 2025 and 6.5x in 2026, respectively. Of course, crypto makes no guarantees. What could go wrong? Execution risk. Building a performant rollup and secure bridge on Bitcoin is not a trivial task. Other stacks chase the same mindshare. If $BTC chops for months, risk budgets thin across the board. Offsetting that, the thesis is simple: extend Bitcoin’s utility without diluting its core promise. If Bitcoin Hyper proves the tech and ships real apps, capital tends to follow utility. Hyper targets a Q4 2025-Q1 2026 listing window, so the presale train doesn’t have much fuel left. And based on the project’s value proposition and investor support, $HYPER could become the next crypto to explode in 2026. Get your $HYPER today. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR and manage risks wisely before investing. Authored by Aaron Walker, NewsBTC: https://www.newsbtc.com/news/next-crypto-to-explode-bitcoin-hyper-l2-could-change-bitcoin",

    "title": "Taiwan Plans BTC Reserve Review — A Bullish Rally Signal For Bitcoin Hyper",
    "body": "What to Know: Taiwan is auditing $BTC exposure and assessing a reserve strategy, with a formal report due by end-2025. This marks a credible institutional tailwind for Bitcoin. Sovereign-level interest strengthens the ‘digital gold’ case and can add marginal demand, supportive for $BTC price and $BTC-native infrastructure. Bitcoin Hyper targets speed and programmability for $BTC via an SVM-based Layer-2, aiming to unlock faster payments, DeFi, and dApps within Bitcoin’s ecosystem. $HYPER’s presale price is $0.013265; a potential high of $0.08625 in 2026 could mean a +550% ROI if devs successfully hit project milestones. Taiwan plans to put Bitcoin on its policy map. Lawmakers have pushed for a full audit of the government’s $BTC exposure and a formal study into adding Bitcoin to national reserves. Premier Cho Jung-tai pledged a detailed Taiwan reserve-strategy report by year-end 2025 . That’s not a casual nod. It’s a signal that $BTC is graduating from ‘risk asset’ to potential sovereign-grade reserve. The motivation is simple enough: diversify a reserve stack still dominated by USD and add a liquid, hard-capped asset with global settlement. This decision comes after Taiwanese legislator Ju Chun Ko had framed Bitcoin as a ‘digital gold’ hedge to USD concentration back in a May 9 session, signalling political cover for a serious allocation debate. Today, Taiwan’s FX hoard sits in the hundreds of billions, totalling $602.94B (of which 90% is USD), as per the CBC . So, even a small allocation would be material on the margin. A proper audit also sweeps up seized coins held by agencies following legal cases — inventory that could seed a pilot treasury program instead of being dumped at auction. This policy change could cause a domino effect. One credible government exploring $BTC reserves tightens the supply narrative and reinforces the ‘digital gold’ idea – particularly in an environment where ETFs have already absorbed a steady flow. If the report lands on schedule and the door opens to a modest allocation, the market gets another demand vector. Projects building real utility around Bitcoin typically benefit first. That’s the plan for Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a $BTC-centric Layer-2 aiming to turn store-of-value into a spend-and-build ecosystem. Bitcoin Hyper Wants to Turn Bitcoin Into a High-Throughput DeFi Ecosystem Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is building a Layer-2 that uses the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for fast execution while anchoring finality to Bitcoin’s base layer. In plain English, this means: cheap, low-latency transactions and smart-contract capability without altering Bitcoin’s consensus. Imagine Solana-style speed and programmability on top of Bitcoin’s security – a combination that’s been missing in $BTC-native ecosystems. To make this happen, the project’s playbook includes a canonical bridge for wrapping $BTC for DeFi use on the Hyper side chain, then releasing the L1 $BTC back to your wallet on exit. Once the live net is up, this setup makes it possible to onboard tooling for payments, DeFi, and dApps. Security is also a dev priority, especially for the project’s financing rounds. External checks from Coinsult and SpyWolf have reviewed the $HYPER token contract and flagged no backdoors or mint functions, a non-negotiable baseline to ensure token scarcity and fair trading. That doesn’t guarantee crypto success, of course. But good security does reduce avoidable smart-contract risk at the token layer. If Taiwan’s review lifts Bitcoin mindshare and on-chain activity, networks that make $BTC usable sit in the slipstream. That’s the lane $HYPER wants to own with its cheap payments, DeFi compatibility, and quick confirmations. See Bitcoin Hyper’s ecosystem plans. $HYPER Token’s Presale Is in Full Swing with $27M+ Raised Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the utility crypto for the Hyper network. Now in presale, $HYPER has crossed $27M, with plans to set aside 75% of its funds to support project development, marketing, and a long-term treasury. The token is priced at $0.013265 right now, though its fundamentals leave room for upside once liquidity and listings arrive in Q4 2025/Q1 2026. According to our $HYPER token forecast , the token has a potential high of $0.02595 in 2025 and $0.08625 in 2026 if listing and live mainnet milestones land as planned. From the current presale price, those levels imply about +96% and +550% respectively — not the moonshot hype you’d see on Crypto Twitter, but grounded in real value and fundamentals. Put simply, if utility ships and Bitcoin stays bid, this type of multiple isn’t fantasy. The market context is certainly on Hyper’s side. Taiwan’s review timeline runs through 2025, overlapping with Bitcoin Hyper’s roadmap windows. A favorable government report won’t flip a switch on day one, yet it improves the macro narrative for $BTC-aligned infrastructure exactly when $HYPER aims to turn on throughput. If a sliver of sovereign-level demand materializes, the liquidity tide can lift the $BTC-centric stack, extending to bridges, wallets, and L2s that make $BTC actually usable. That’s where a fast SVM execution layer tied to Bitcoin’s settlement could capture real volumes instead of pure speculation. Join Bitcoin Hyper and get 43% APY.

    "title": "Best Crypto to Buy as Franklin Templeton Extends Benji to $6T Canton Network",
    "body": "What to Know: Canton’s $6T processed assets and $280B daily repo volumes show tokenization has graduated from pilots to real transaction flow. Franklin Templeton extending Benji to Canton tightens the loop between regulated funds, collateral networks, and on-chain settlement. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) targets Bitcoin’s biggest gap – throughput – while Best Wallet Token ($BEST) leans into UX; Stellar ($XLM) anchors cross-border payments with deep listings. For presale exposure, $HYPER offers higher beta to Layer-2 demand; $BEST ties to wallet utility; $XLM provides listed liquidity. Franklin Templeton just plugged its Benji tokenization stack into the Canton Network, the institution-first blockchain linking collateral, settlement, and regulated markets. The move expands Benji’s reach from public networks into Canton’s private, permissioned rails where banks and trading firms already exchange tokenized assets. It’s a small line in a press release, but a big nudge toward mainstream on-chain finance. This matters, because Canton has scaled beyond pilot theater. Applications on the network are handling more than $6T in tokenized assets and north of $280B in daily U.S. Treasury repo transactions, a scale that signals real throughput rather than slideware. If tokenization is the sticky bridge between TradFi and crypto, Canton is where that bridge is getting traffic – and Benji now sits on it. For investors, this is a credibility signal. Regulated fund shares moving on a network that already processes institutional collateral give tokenized money funds and RWA collateral a clearer route into trading workflows. 💡 That’s a tailwind for projects positioned around Bitcoin scalability, self-custody user experience, and cross-border payments – three narratives with actual users and obvious product-market fit. Through that lens, three names stand out today as the best crypto to buy now. Read on as we delve into Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST), both in presale, plus Stellar ($XLM) on the listed side. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin Layer-2 With Throughput Ambitions When regulated funds go on-chain, low-latency settlement and high-capacity rails stop being optional. Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) pitch is simple: bring Solana-style speed to Bitcoin via a Layer-2 that batches, executes, and settles back to the Layer-1. The presale broke the $27M milestone today, suggesting there’s real appetite for a throughput-first Bitcoin Layer-2 rather than just another meme coin with orange branding. $HYPER is currently priced at $0.013265 with 43% staking APY. ➡️ Check out our step-by-step guide to buying $HYPER. In simple words, Hyper relies on tools like the Solana Virtual Machine and a canonical bridge to make the Bitcoin ecosystem more scalable, cheaper, and more performant, which would qualify it for mainstream adoption. If the Benji-to-Canton momentum translates into higher institutional tolerance for on-chain collateral, Layer-2s enabling $BTC-adjacent activity benefit first. The near-term math checks out. 💰 Our price prediction for $HYPER suggests a potential 2026 high near $0.08625 as core roadmap items – initial dApps, listings, and a DAO – ship. From today’s $0.013265 presale price, that’s roughly ~6.5x to the 2026 high if execution stays on track. These stats alone recommend $HYPER as one of the best crypto to buy today. This isn’t a free lunch; delivery risk is real and competition across Bitcoin Layer-2s is heating up. But the asymmetry suits presale math, and the story aligns with the market’s push toward on-chain collateral and instant settlement. 🚀 Don’t delay – buy your $HYPER today. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Utility-First Wallet Token With Presale Traction Canton’s growth underscores a simple truth: the next wave of users will need better UX for multi-chain portfolios, bridging, and payments. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) centers that need. It’s the native asset for the self-custody Best Wallet app ecosystem that folds in a DEX, cross-chain swaps, and a card product. The presale has reached the 17M raised, with the token currently priced at $0.025935. That’s not froth; that’s users voting for utility and distribution. The Best Wallet ecosystem offers non-custodial services and plans to ‘capture 40% of the crypto wallet market share by the end of 2026’. The roadmap details the exact strategy at work, which involves milestones like 60+ chain support, a fiat offramp, and the Best Card, to name a few. 💰 Our price prediction for $BEST sees a potential end-2025 range topping around $0.035215 and a 2026 potential high near $0.05106175 if the roadmap lands – wallet growth, card rollout, and deeper integrations. From the current presale price, that’s ~36%–90% upside across the two years, with compounding utility rather than pure narrative carrying the lift. Yes, execution and listings timing matter. Still, with tokenized funds and RWAs normalizing, a wallet that abstracts network sprawl while offering real-world spend hooks is exactly what many newcomers will need. ➡️ Our guide to buying $BEST will help you navigate the purchase process. But hurry – the presale ends in two weeks. 🚀 Buy $BEST today and stake it for 77% APY while you still can. 3. Stellar ($XLM) – Payments Rail With Exchange Liquidity Today Stellar ($XLM) remains one of the most proven options for compliant cross-border transfers and fiat on-/off-ramps, now supported by Soroban smart contracts to widen its developer surface. Recent figures show $XLM at $0.2921 with a market cap above $9.3B, and the asset is broadly listed, including on Binance and Coinbase – meaning price discovery and liquidity are not theoretical. In a world where tokenized fund shares and repo collateral settle on permissioned chains, there’s still a huge role for public infrastructure that lets fintechs, remittance players, and stablecoin issuers move value across borders. ⚙️ Stellar’s blend of speed, low fees, and established exchange coverage keeps it relevant as the tokenization stack grows above it. Holders also get a clean story: payments first, programmability now, and plenty of listings to trade the cycle. With $XLM above $0.29 at the time of writing and an all-time ROI north of 9,677%, this one seems to be a banger. 🚀 Buy $XLM on Binance and other leading platforms today. Recap: Franklin Templeton’s Canton integration is the headline, but the subtext is bigger: regulated liquidity is moving on-chain at industrial scale. That is the connective tissue behind $HYPER’s Layer-2 throughput pitch, $BEST’s UX-led approach to self-custody, and $XLM’s liquid payments rail. If the question is the best crypto to buy into this tokenized-finance backdrop, these three sit squarely in the narrative with distinct roles and risk profiles.

    "title": "Popular Crypto Trader Reveals Why Bitcoin Price Is Still Crashing",
    "body": "Bitcoin is down by 2.1% in the past 24 hours, and its latest decline has come at a moment when many traders expected the opposite. The US government shutdown is already in the process of winding down after weeks of uncertainty, yet the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum have continued to drift lower and are under pressure. The cryptocurrency market’s inability to rebound notably has led to active debate among traders on X. One of the most vocal views came from a popular trader known as The White Whale, whose remarks express a growing sense of frustration across the crypto community. The Shutdown Isn’t Really Over The White Whale argument is that the crypto market’s price action is yet to rebound because the government shutdown is not truly over. The analyst insinuates that the apparent resolution to the shutdown is far less reassuring than it looks. Related Reading: Adam Beck’s Bitcoin Realization: What Kind Of Money Is BTC? In his view, the government only approved short-term funding so that federal workers get paid through the holiday period, but this leaves the underlying issue unresolved. The temporary nature of the fix means the same uncertainty could come back in just a few weeks, which he believes is preventing markets from reacting positively. The discussion attracted instant responses, including a contrasting view from another commentator, Nara Sumas. Sumas dismissed the idea that the shutdown is the main factor behind price action, noting that markets barely reacted when the shutdown began. The point is that the macro crypto environment is already heavy with weak sentiment, and there is bad news about the markets every day. Therefore, the crypto market’s decline has more to do with those structural conditions than with government drama. Furthermore, the brief uptick earlier in the week was due to exuberance and not anything based on fundamentals. Despite the pushback, The White Whale doubled down on his stance. He maintained that markets do react to shutdowns, but not immediately. Therefore, the delayed downturn is a reaction after it became apparent to investors that the situation wasn’t going to be resolved quickly. What’s Next For The Crypto Market? The path ahead for the crypto market is tied to whether confidence can return after weeks of choppy price action and sentiment. The exchange between traders on X, like the one highlighted above, shows that many are weighing the impact of the temporary government funding deal against the deeper macro issues that have shaped this downturn.

Even though the shutdown is winding down, the uncertainty around what happens next is notable, especially for investors who rely on clear policy direction before taking on additional risk. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,900, down by 2% in the past 24 hours. At the same time, XRP is witnessing a resurgence in interest, as investors are now awaiting the possible launch of a US-based Spot XRP ETF this week.

    "title": "Kyrgyzstan’s Gold-Backed Stablecoin Could Be Shining New Light on Best Wallet Token",
    "body": "What to Know: USDKG changes the usual stablecoin model by backing a dollar peg with real gold from Kyrgyzstan’s reserves. If gold and commodity stablecoins grow, users will want wallets that handle many stablecoins without turning their portfolio into a spreadsheet headache. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) gives real perks, like lower fees, early presale access, and smooth cross-chain swaps. Stablecoin liquidity drives the market, and wallet-layer tokens can collect lasting value from routing, discovery, and spending features. Think of them as the toll booths of the crypto highways. Kyrgyzstan surprised the stablecoin world with $USDKG, a gold-backed dollar coin that comes with a $50M first mint. It’s a different style in a market where most issuers rely on T-bills and repo. This launch is not just a flashy headline. It shows Kyrgyzstan wants more freedom in cross-border trade in a world full of sanctions and red tape. It also pushes the idea that dollar-pegged coins do not always need US financial plumbing behind them. $USDKG is pegged 1:1 to the dollar . Simple. But the backing is the twist. Gold replaces the usual short-term US assets. If USDKG becomes useful for settlement in Central Asia and nearby regions, we could see other countries and commodity exporters try non-Treasury collateral, too. It won’t shake the US.bond market tomorrow, but it does widen the design space for stablecoins. Think of it as switching from a single spice kitchen to a full spice rack. This shift brings wallets into the picture. People don’t change stablecoins alone – they change the tools they use. A wallet that handles swaps, cuts fees, and helps you find new assets becomes the winner. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is built for this moment. It offers a retail-friendly, non-custodial setup where the token has real utility inside the app. If gold-backed and commodity-linked stablecoins pick up speed, users will want wallets that make juggling multiple coins painless. That’s where $BEST fits. The token supports an ecosystem made for cross-chain swaps, presale access, and smoother on-off-ramp flows. Why Best Wallet Token ($BEST) Stands Out in the New Stablecoin Era When collateral changes, user habits change too. Gold backing means nothing if you can’t hold USDKG next to USDT, USDC, and your favorite RWA tokens without stress. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) focuses exactly on removing that stress. The Best Wallet app is non-custodial and multi-chain. It uses Fireblocks MPC security, so you stay in control while avoiding the classic seed phrase panic moment (we’ve all had that nightmare). Inside the app, a DEX aggregator pulls liquidity across some 300 chains and 30 bridges. You rebalance your assets with one tap instead of spending a week crying over gas fees, failed approvals, and mystery errors. $BEST shapes the economics of the wallet. Hold it, and you pay fewer fees. Swaps can get better terms when the network is busy. You also get early access to new tokens through the Upcoming Tokens portal. In a future where gold coins, sovereign coins, and tokenized Treasuries sit side by side, this curation layer becomes useful. You find new assets while staying inside one interface that already holds your $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, and standard stablecoins. Add portfolio tools, multiple wallet support, and anti-fraud features, and you end up with an app built for fast moves between new stablecoin rails and the wider crypto market. If USDKG and similar coins create new trade routes, the wallets that lower switching costs will capture users. It’s a smart time to check out the $BEST presale. The $BEST Presale and Why Timing Helps Wallet Tokens Macro forces help this story. Stablecoins already hold huge piles of T-bills and dominate on-chain liquidity. If some capital shifts toward gold-backed or commodity-linked models, that could expand stablecoin use cases rather than shrink them. In that world, wallet-layer tokens can capture a steady flow of fees and loyalty. The $BEST presale just passed the $17M mark, and you can buy $BEST for just $0.025935. The setup is simple: give the token real perks inside the app and reward people who use it. That includes reduced fees, early allocations, and higher engagement through staking. As cross-chain swaps and launchpad tools grow, the token becomes something you feel in daily use, not just a number on a dashboard. Holders get cheaper transactions, exclusive early access to trusted new projects before they launch publically, and a voice in which chains and features appear next. Demand is not imagined. It grows from an app that already solves basic user problems. At the current presale price, future listings and feature rollouts matter mainly through fee savings and access. That is a healthier angle in a market where narratives move quickly and every little transaction cost adds up. If you think stablecoins will keep diversifying and retail users will keep chasing easier tools, Best Wallet Token is one of the best crypto presales to invest in.

    "title": "Bitcoin Eyes New All-Time High As Analyst Sets $170K Target",
    "body": "According to market watchers, US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs posted a $520 million inflow on Tuesday, a sharp change after a mild $1.15 million inflow the day before and a recent week that saw $1.22 billion in withdrawals. Related Reading: XRP Has Held Its Ground As Most Altcoins Fall, Market Observers Say That swing in flows is being watched closely because inflows into ETFs have in the past helped drive big price climbs. Right now Bitcoin trades around $104,000, and some analysts say a jump toward $160,000–$170,000 is possible if buying pressure keeps building. Diminishing Golden Curves Hint At Lower Peaks Based on reports from CryptoCon, a model called diminishing golden curves maps price bands using logarithmic regression. The model tracks how far Bitcoin moves above a “Golden Curve” growth path and labels those moves with deviation levels. The next target for #Bitcoin is between $160,000 and $170,000 🚀 pic.twitter.com/QAd3RdDS8q — Bitcoin Teddy (@Bitcoin_Teddy) November 12, 2025 Past cycle tops landed at +5 in November 2013, +4 in December 2017, and +3 in November 2021. CryptoCon’s projection now places the next top near the +2 band, which translates to a range between $160,000 and $170,000, with a possible swing toward $186,000. If that plays out, Bitcoin would climb about 70% from current levels near $104,000. Halving Rhythm Still In Play Reports show the chart also uses halving-based sine waves. Since the last halving occurred in April 2024, the model expects a market peak in late 2025, a timing that matches the rough 12–18 month pattern seen after previous halvings. That rhythm has been a simple guide for many traders. It is not a guarantee, but it helps explain why analysts are paying attention to late 2025 as a possible climax point. Stablecoin And Exchange Reserves Add Weight On-chain signals add more detail. The stablecoin supply ratio has fallen to levels that historically lined up with market lows, suggesting there is dry powder waiting on the sidelines. Data from Binance shows stablecoin reserves rising while Bitcoin reserves on the exchange fall — a mix often read as accumulation by long-term holders. CryptoQuant analyst Moreno says liquidity is increasing and volatility is low, which can make the risk-reward seem attractive to buyers. Related Reading: Dogecoin Alert! Price Could Explode Over 2,800%, Analyst Says Timing And Risks Remain Important Market conditions could change quickly, Especially with new economic data and the end of the US government shutdown. That kind of macro event can add volatility and shift flows. Models like the Diminishing Golden Curves are useful tools, yet they depend on history repeating in ways that might not hold if a major shock appears.
