    "title": "Bitcoin Sentiment Whiplash: Mood Sours From Greed To Extreme Fear In Days",
    "body": "Data shows the Bitcoin market sentiment has seen a sharp turnaround recently as the Fear & Greed Index has swung to extreme fear. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Back In Extreme Fear Zone The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottoming Phase Was Driven By Large Entities, Glassnode Data Shows The index uses the data of the following five factors to determine the investor mentality: market cap dominance, trading volume, volatility, Google Trends, and social media sentiment. To represent the sentiment, it uses a numerical scale running from zero to hundred. When the value of the Fear & Greed Index is greater than 53, it means a sentiment of greed is shared by the majority of traders. On the other hand, the indicator being below 47 implies the dominance of fear. All values lying between these two cutoffs correspond to a net neutral mentality. Besides these three core regions, there are also two ‘extreme’ zones, known as the extreme fear (occurring at 25 and under) and extreme greed (above 75). At present, the market sentiment is in one of these zones, as the Fear & Greed Index’s latest value suggests. As displayed above, the Bitcoin market sentiment is just inside the extreme fear territory right now, with the Fear & Greed Index sitting at 24. This level of despair among traders is a new development, as just earlier mood was much better. On January 15th, the index had a value of 61, putting the sentiment of the average investor firmly inside the greed territory. Only six days later, the situation has completely flipped. The reason behind this shift lies in the bearish price action that the cryptocurrency has faced since US President Donald Trump announced tariffs on several European countries over Greenland. The earlier greed sentiment also came after trader mentality saw a sharp swing. In fact, the shift was even faster back then, as the Fear & Greed Index went from a near-extreme fear level of 26 to the greedy value of 61 over just two days as Bitcoin witnessed a price surge beyond $97,000. Related Reading: Chainlink Drops To $12.50, But Largest Whales Are Accumulating The latest drop back into the extreme zone may not entirely be a negative development for the cryptocurrency, though, if history is anything to refer to. Often, digital asset markets have tended to move in the direction that goes contrary to the expectations of the majority. Since extreme fear is where a bearish mentality is the strongest, bottoms can be likely to occur in the zone. Similarly, extreme greed can lead to tops instead. With the sentiment currently in the former zone, it now remains to be seen how long it will take for Bitcoin to find back its footing. BTC Price Bitcoin dropped under $88,000 earlier in the day, but the coin has since bounced back to $90,200. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin To $80,000? Analyst Warns Of Potential Free Fall As BTC Erases 2026 Gains",
    "body": "As the market erases its 2026 gains, Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen to its lowest level in weeks and is attempting to reclaim a crucial level. Some market observers have warned that a retest of the November lows is likely if volatility continues. Related Reading: BitMine’s Ethereum Holdings Near 3.5% Supply Milestone As ETH Falls Below $3,000 Bitcoin Breaks Down From Key Support On Wednesday, Bitcoin continued to pullback and hit a three-week low of $87,263. The cryptocurrency had been trading between the $90,000-$96,000 range since its start-of-the-year breakout, reaching a two-month high of $97,924 a week ago. However, the crypto market has experienced significant volatility over the past few days, fueled by renewed geopolitical tensions. As a result, BTC has retraced 10% in the past week, falling to the mid-zone of its $84,000-$94,000 range. Amid this performance, trader Wealthmanager noted that the flagship crypto had retraced all its 2026 gains, briefly falling below its yearly opening and POC. He added that this is a critical level to hold in the coming days, as losing this area could send the price back to the $80,000 mark. Analyst Crypto Jelle highlighted a two-month bear flag structure on BTC’s daily chart, suggesting a high chance of a breakdown. “Lose the current lows again, and bears will be fully back in the driver’s seat,” he asserted. Similarly, Market observer Lyvo Crypto pointed out the same formation, detailing that Bitcoin broke down from the pattern’s ascending support after the recent price action and lost its two-month uptrend. To the trader, this signals that “momentum is fully in the bears’ control” and “if it [bearish momentum] sustains, we could see a free fall” that could likely result in a retest of the $78,000 area. In the case of a breakdown to the November lows, he advised that “from there, we’ll wait for confirmation of a double bottom and look for a relief rally.” BTC To Repeat Its 2020 Price Action? Crypto Bullet drew a parallel between BTC’s current price action and its performance in early 2022. The analyst affirmed that the current price action closely mirrors its 2022 fractal, which could signal that a major correction is ahead. At the time, Bitcoin retraced over 40% from its late 2021 cycle top, followed by a “dead cat bounce” at the start of 2022 and a second major correction toward new lows. Now, the flagship crypto displays a similar performance as it has retraced 30% from the October highs and is currently attempting to reclaim the lost ground. However, Crypto Bullet noted that there are two significant differences from its 2022 correction. Related Reading: Solana At Risk Of Breakdown After Key Rejection – Is $100 Next? First, Bitcoin has yet to retest the 50-week and 200-week Moving Averages (MAs). Second, the timing hints that the final breakdown is not due until later in Q1. “If we match the 2022 fractal’s top and the October 2025 top, we’ll see there’s still about 1 month of PA to make that final leg up and test the 50-Week MA or the 200-Day MA,” he explained. He concluded that one more pump above the $100,000 is likely, but advised caution as the key supports are being tested. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $89,890, a 1.2% increase in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Santiment Says XRP Social Sentiment Hits ‘Extreme Fear’: Buy Signal?",
    "body": "XRP is back in a familiar spot: social chatter has turned sharply bearish even as the market probes support after an early-January surge. Analytics firm Santiment said its social data shows XRP slipping into “Extreme Fear” after a roughly 19% pullback from its early-month high, a setup it argues has historically preceded rallies. Santiment wrote on Jan. 22 via X: “According to our social data, XRP has fallen into ‘Extreme Fear’ territory. Small retail traders have become pessimistic toward the #5 market cap cryptocurrency after a -19% drop since the high back on January 5th. Historically, this high level of bearish commentary leads to rallies. Prices move the opposite to retails’ expectations more often than not.” Related Reading: Pundit Clarifies XRP Roadmap To $10: How Price Will Play Out In 2026 The chart Santiment shared pairs XRP’s 6-hour candles with a social ratio measuring positive versus negative commentary, and overlays three “buy” and three “sell” markers tied to sentiment bands. Those bands are explicitly labeled as a “fear zone” (where prices “go up”), a neutral zone, and a “greed zone” (where prices “go down”). How Reliable Is The XRP Social Sentiment Signal? To check the timing, daily XRP spot data for the same late-December-to-January window broadly supports the chart’s claim that extreme sentiment readings often show up near inflection points, with an important caveat: not every signal front-runs a turn cleanly, and some arrive early. The first “buy” marker on the chart is dated Jan. 2. On that day, XRP closed around $2.01 after trading as low as roughly $1.87, and the market proceeded to accelerate into the week’s blow-off move: by Jan. 5 XRP closed near $2.35, and the Jan. 6 session printed a high around $2.42. In other words, the Jan. 2 “buy” call landed ahead of the sharp leg higher that set the period’s high. Related Reading: XRP Market Structure Resembles That Of February 2022, Glassnode Warns The first “sell” marker is dated Jan. 7, immediately after the peak. XRP closed around $2.16 that day and then bled lower across the next sessions, sliding toward the low-$2.00s by Jan. 12. On sequence alone, that sell signal aligns with the market shifting from post-spike distribution into a steadier downtrend. The second “sell” marker, Jan. 11, is less straightforward. XRP closed near $2.07 on Jan. 11 and dipped again on Jan. 12, but then logged a sharp rebound on Jan. 13, closing around $2.17. Traders treating the Jan. 11 marker as an immediate top signal would have faced a short-term whipsaw before downside resumed. That brings the chart’s third “sell” marker (Jan. 13) which appears to target that rebound itself. From Jan. 13’s close near $2.17, XRP rolled back over: it faded through mid-month and ultimately slid into the Jan. 20 low around $1.87 (intraday), which maps cleanly to the chart’s contention that “greed-zone” sentiment can coincide with local exhaustion. On the “buy” side late in the window, Santiment flags Jan. 18 and Jan. 20–21. The Jan. 18 marker arrived early: XRP closed around $1.99 on Jan. 18 but continued lower into Jan. 20 before rebounding. The current Jan. 20–21 marker fits better in the short term, with XRP bouncing from the Jan. 20 close near $1.89 to roughly $1.95 by today. Even so, that rebound has so far been modest relative to the broader drawdown from the $2.4 area peak. Santiment’s broader point is contrarian: when social feeds tip into one-sided pessimism, marginal selling pressure may already be exhausted, setting up mean reversion. The recent signal history partially supports that while also showing the practical risk: entries can be early, and “extreme fear” can persist if trend conditions remain heavy. At press time, XRP traded at $1.9498. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Here’s Why The XRP Price Is Still Weak, And Could Crash Further",
    "body": "With the market still weak and uncertainty lingering, concerns of another XRP price crash are growing. This comes as selling pressure increases and market dynamics show no clear indications of an upcoming bullish reversal. Notably, XRP’s ongoing downtrend also coincides with a decline in both retail and institutional activity, underscoring weakened confidence across the broader market. XRP Price Stays Weak Amid Retail And Institutional Decline After jumping above $2 earlier this year, the XRP price stayed stuck around that level for weeks, repeatedly attempting to break to the upside but failing. Following last week’s unexpected price increase, the cryptocurrency crashed down toward $1.95, where it has since stabilized and continued to consolidate for several days. This unexpected downturn suggests that XRP remains just as weak as it was last year despite the brief rally. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin About To Repeat NVIDIA’s Run? Here’s What The Chart Says This weakness and price volatility appear to be driven by a slowdown in institutional participation. As selling pressure continues to mount, Spot XRP ETFs have recently recorded their second outflow since launching in November 2025. This latest outflow marks the largest ever recorded by XRP ETFs. According to SoSoValue, the first XRP ETF outflow occurred earlier this year, on January 7, when $40,80 million exited the investment products. The most recent data shows that XRP ETFs recorded another outflow of approximately $53.32 million on Tuesday, January 20. Grayscale was the only issuer to post outflows that day, with more than $55.39 million leaving its GXRP ETF, while products issued by Canary, Bitwise, and 21 Shares saw zero flows. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ recorded inflows of $2.07 million, which only slightly offset the losses, bringing the net daily outflow to $53.32 million. If more outflows occur, the continued drop in institutional activity, combined with XRP’s weakened price, could push the cryptocurrency lower. At present, XRP is trying to recover from recent losses, with its price rising approximately 1.62% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. XRP Open Interest Crash Adds To Weakness In addition to the decline in ETF inflows, XRP’s Open Interest (OI) has reportedly crashed to new lows, signaling a sharp reduction in trading activity and retail market participation. Data from Coinglass shows that XRP’s derivatives market saw its futures Open Interest fall to $3.35 billion this Wednesday. This marks the lowest level recorded since January 1, 2026, when OI declined to $3.33 billion.

    "title": "Here’s How XRP Is Building The Financial Rails For Trillions In Global Value",
    "body": "XRP is increasingly being positioned as the core infrastructure for moving massive amounts of value across global financial networks. As trillions of dollars move daily across borders, platforms, and asset classes, the limitations of legacy systems are becoming impossible to ignore. Its core value lies in its ability to function as a neutral, high-speed bridge between disparate financial systems. Is XRP Becoming A Standard Layer For Value Transfer? XRP is building the rails for trillions, and the shift is already happening. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull reported a video on X where Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed at Davos 2026 that the payment firm has been working directly with banks around the world to connect tokenization and DeFi through the XRP Ledger, thereby turning it into a bridge between traditional finance and on-chain markets. Related Reading: Japan’s XRP Integration Signals A Shift In Global Capital Flows The number alone shows how fast the tokenized asset is moving. In just one year, the volume has grown from $19 trillion to $33 trillion, which is a 75% increase. According to Xfinancebull, most people still have no idea how big this will get. This is the shift; the rails are being laid right now, and XRP Ledger is one of the few networks that are ready to handle it. When institutional money starts moving at scale, it won’t care about the narratives or favorite altcoins. Instead, it will flow to where the infrastructure already exists, which is bullish for XRP. Why Respecting Channel Levels Signals A Healthy Market Structure The XRP market capitalization structure still looks constructive. An analyst known as Bird has highlighted that on the higher-time frame chart, XRP has been moving inside a clear descending accumulation channel for the past six months, and price has respected the top, mid-range, and bottom of that channel almost perfectly, which is exactly what should play out during a healthy accumulation phase. Related Reading: XRP Maintains Bullish Bias Above $1.30 Despite Recent Rejection Recently, the price pushed into the upper half of the channel, and then pulled back this week to retest the mid-range support. If this level continues to hold, the structure suggests that the altcoin is set up for another push higher, in Bird’s opinion. However, what makes this setup more interesting is how well it lines up with what’s happening across the broader market. The Russel 2000 is sitting at all-time highs, metals are starting to look like they are topping, Bitcoin dominance is beginning to feel heavy, Brad Garlinghouse speaks at Davos today, and the recent wave of community riddles has dropped this week. Bird concluded that when multiple signals start lining up like this, it usually means the market is preparing for a larger move. From the chart perspective, Bird remains bullish on the XRP setup.

    "body": "The Shiba Inu price crashed to as low as $0.000007683 yesterday, sparking bearish sentiment towards the meme coin. This crash came on the back of a transfer of billions of SHIB tokens, which raised concerns of a potential sell-off by the whale in question. Why The Shiba Inu Price Crashed The Shiba Inu price crashed amid significant selling pressure, with a SHIB whale sending billions of tokens to Robinhood, likely to offload these tokens. Arkham data shows that the whale (0x2d0…9f7bB) first sent 210.365 billion SHIB tokens, worth $1.63 million, to the crypto exchange. These tokens represented about 97% of the whale’s SHIB holdings. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sell-Offs Incoming: 82 Trillion Deposits Threaten To Crash SHIB Price Further data from Arkham shows that the SHIB whale sent an additional 1.52 billion tokens to Robinhood and 7 billion tokens to liquidity provider B2C2 Group, which could be an OTC sale. The Shiba Inu price has notably crashed by over 7% in the last week, and it suffered its worst drop during this period yesterday amid the whale’s transfers. The whale now holds only 5.86 billion SHIB, worth $46,790. The Shiba Inu price also crashed due to the sell-off in the broader crypto market, led by Bitcoin. BC dropped to as low as $87,000 yesterday amid concerns over trade tensions between the U.S. and Europe stemming from the Greenland-linked Trump tariffs. However, the market recovered towards the end of the day as Trump announced that he had canceled the proposed tariffs, having reached a Greenland deal with NATO. Despite the recent Shiba Inu price crash, the meme coin is still up over 15% year-to-date (YTD) and ranks among the best-performing crypto assets this year. However, SHIb is still far off from its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.00008845. Exchange Netflows For SHIB Remains Mixed SHIB’s exchange netflows have remained mixed, indicating there is no clear accumulation pattern for the meme coin at the moment. CryptoQuant data shows that today’s net flows are negative, totaling just over 7 billion Shiba Inu tokens, suggesting that more coins are flowing into exchanges than out. However, the total exchanges’ netflows yesterday were positive, at 1.6 billion tokens, indicating more tokens leaving exchanges, which is bullish for the Shiba Inu price as it hints at accumulation from whales. On January 16, SHIB’s netflows were also positive, totaling around 115 billion tokens. However, the positive netflows on that day were overshadowed by the negative flows of 214 billion SHIB recorded on January 20. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Shiba Inu Price Jumped Over 13% Crypto traders still remain bullish on the Shiba Inu price as CoinGlass data shows the long/short ratio is currently above 1. Derivatives trading volume has also jumped by over 20% while the open interest is up almost 3%. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.000007978, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "Coinbase Exec Points Out The Big Difference Between Bitcoin And Central Banks",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s role in the global financial system remains widely misunderstood, even at the highest levels of policy and finance. That disconnect surfaced during a major international forum, prompting a pointed clarification from a Coinbase executive. The moment centered on a fundamental question with growing relevance: what truly separates Bitcoin from central banks? Bitcoin’s Structural Design Sets It Apart – Coinbase Executive During the World Economic Forum in Davos, where global policymakers and financial leaders were debating the future of money and tokenization, Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, responded to remarks made by François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Banque de France, who argued that central banks deserve greater trust than Bitcoin because they operate under democratic mandates and institutional oversight. Related Reading: Pundit Clarifies XRP Roadmap To $10: How Price Will Play Out In 2026 Armstrong’s response focused on how Bitcoin is designed. Bitcoin operates as a decentralized protocol with no issuing authority, no governing committee, and no single entity capable of altering its monetary rules. Its supply is fixed, its issuance is algorithmic, and its operation depends on a distributed network of participants rather than institutional oversight. This design makes Bitcoin structurally independent in a way no central bank can replicate. By contrast, central banks sit at the top of national monetary systems. They control currency issuance, influence interest rates, and adjust monetary policy in response to political and economic pressures. Even when described as “independent,” they remain tightly connected to governments and fiscal policy. Armstrong highlighted that this link introduces discretion, policy shifts, and long-term currency debasement through money creation—a vulnerability Bitcoin was explicitly built to avoid. This distinction becomes especially relevant during periods of aggressive deficit spending. Because Bitcoin’s supply cannot be expanded, it functions as a constraint rather than a tool. In Armstrong’s view, this makes Bitcoin a direct counterweight to systems where new money can be introduced at will, gradually reducing purchasing power over time. That structural constraint is the foundation of Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge during periods of uncertainty. Trust, Accountability, And Individual Choice The exchange also exposed a deeper disagreement about how trust is formed. Villeroy de Galhau emphasized trust in central banks as institutions backed by legal authority and democratic systems. Armstrong countered by reframing trust as something derived from transparency and verifiability rather than institutional reputation. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin About To Repeat NVIDIA’s Run? Here’s What The Chart Says Armstrong further positioned Bitcoin as an accountability mechanism. Because its supply cannot be adjusted to accommodate government spending, it imposes discipline by design. In this sense, Bitcoin functions less as a policy tool and more as a constraint—similar to how gold historically limited monetary excess. This characteristic has driven its growing perception as a store of value during times of economic uncertainty. Importantly, Armstrong did not frame the relationship between Bitcoin and fiat currencies as a zero-sum battle. Instead, he described it as a healthy competition that leaves the ultimate decision with individuals. Users can choose between systems: one based on institutional control and policy flexibility, and another based on fixed rules and decentralization.

    "title": "This Bitcoin Price Level Must Hold Or It’s Mid-$50,000s: Veteran Analyst",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s April 2025 swing low around $73,000 has become the make-or-break line for 2026, according to veteran professional trader and commentator Nik Patel, who argues that a higher-timeframe break below that level would likely open the door to a prolonged grind in the mid-$50,000s. In Part Three of his “2026 Outlook” published Jan. 21, Patel laid out a high-conviction call that Bitcoin prints fresh all-time highs in the first half of 2026, framing it as further evidence the market has shifted away from the clean, narrative-driven four-year cycle. “Bitcoin trades new all-time highs in H1 — the 4-year cycle is dead,” he wrote, summarizing his regime view as “higher for longer,” potentially stretching into 2027. Why Bitcoin Must Hold $73,000 Or Risk A Slide Patel’s core technical claim is simple: as long as Bitcoin does not close key higher timeframes below the April 2025 low, the broader structure remains intact and the base case is continuation higher. He acknowledged that he expected a sharper reversal earlier: “Timing-wise, I was wrong on my expectations for a more immediate reversal,” but stressed that price has continued to hold above the April lows “despite having every reason to break and close below.” Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Power Shift: New Whales Now Control The Market That resilience, in his view, matters more than moving averages or anchored references. “Since 2022, we have not made fresh lows on a weekly timeframe below the bottoms that preceded the next highs (or, more plainly, weekly structure in the most technical sense has remained bullish with higher-highs and higher-lows),” Patel wrote. “This has not changed and I place less weight on MAs, VWAPs etc. than I do on price itself, and whilst the $73k April lows that preceded the $126k all-time highs are protected, weekly structure is still bullish.” His forecast leans heavily on a macro and positioning backdrop he describes as inconsistent with a deep-cycle crypto bear market. Patel cited “Goldilocks into reflation,” rising inflation breakevens, falling real rates, midterm dynamics, and bearish sentiment and positioning as part of the setup that makes a 2018- or 2022-style unwind less likely in his framework. Patel’s downside map is unusually explicit for a discretionary macro-technical thesis. “If I’m wrong — and we close the higher timeframes below $73k — we likely trade mid-$50ks this year, consolidate there for many months and produce no new highs in 2026,” he wrote, outlining a scenario where a structural failure forces a wholesale reassessment. He reiterated that the trigger is not an intraday wick but timeframe closes. In his year-ahead playbook, he described being “invalidated on a weekly close below $73k but with a view to re-entering on an immediate reclaim,” while “fully” cutting exposure if Bitcoin prints a monthly close below $73,000, in which case he would “prepare for mid-$50ks.” Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Selling Off On Quantum Fears? A Reality Check Patel also pushed back on the idea that the drawdown from the highs represents a new, uniquely bearish regime. “Where many view the most recent move off the highs into $80k as a ‘structural shift unlike prior corrections’, I disagree and continue to view this as a ‘higher for longer’ regime within which we have these 30-40% corrections, range-bound price-action chewing through supply and subsequently continue higher,” he wrote. He added that the correction “felt different” in part because it coincided with what he called “the largest liquidation event in crypto history,” alongside forced selling dynamics and long-term holder supply, yet it has still only produced a drawdown modestly larger than prior pullbacks in the broader uptrend. Even so, Patel allowed for near-term turbulence. He said there is “a decent chance we sweep the November low in early Q1,” but maintained he “categorically” does not expect a higher-timeframe close below the April lows in the first half of the year. His base case remains new highs in H1 2026—“perhaps in late Q1 but likely in early Q2.” At press time, BTC traded at $90,060. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Completes ‘Super Guppy Compression’ Against Bitcoin, Next Target Emerges",
    "body": "According to a recent technical analysis by market expert Egrag Crypto, XRP has formed a “Super Guppy Compression” against Bitcoin, signaling the potential for a major structural shift. The analyst has revealed what could come next for the XRP/BTC pair following this development, indicating a higher probability of a bullish breakout within the next few months. XRP Bitcoin Pair Forms Super Guppy Compression In his X post, Egrag Crypto provided a detailed breakdown of the XRP/BTC price structure and the recent patterns emerging within its chart. He suggested that the trading pair recently entered a transition phase after a multi-year decline, with price action tightening as the market moved through a period of compression. Related Reading: What the Triple-Tap At $1.80 Means For The XRP Price Egrag Crypto revealed that XRP/BTC has completed a Super Guppy Compression pattern, which shows full ribbon compression across both short- and long-term Moving Averages (MA). According to the analyst, this compression signals an upcoming volatility expansion, indicates exhausted selling pressure, and highlights a clear transition phase in the market. Color dynamics within the Guppy system on the chart also suggest a shift in market behavior. Egrag Crypto notes that the short-term Moving Averages, or “ribbons” as he calls them, are turning green, signaling early bullish momentum. At the same time, long-term ribbons remain red but are flattening, indicating that the downward trend on XRP/BTC is easing. These developments also show that the market has exited its bearish phase; however, a clear uptrend has yet to emerge, leaving the trading pair in a base-building stage. From a price-structure perspective, Egrag Crypto notes that XRP/BTC is forming a bullish rectangular pattern. The analyst revealed that the trading pair had repeatedly bounced off support while facing rejection at resistance, indicating that supply is being absorbed rather than aggressively sold off. According to him, this behavior aligns with textbook reaccumulation patterns observed after extended downtrends, signaling a potential upward move ahead. Egrag Crypto has shared key targets for where he believes XRP/BTC could go next, depending on its current market structure. He noted that the structure matters more than the underlying emotion, suggesting that although the market may seem quiet, it is actively positioning for a decisive move. Analyst Sets Bullish And Bearish Targets For XRP/BTC Continuing his analysis, Egrag Crypto predicted that over the next three to six months, the XRP/BTC price has a 60-70% chance of a bullish breakout. He added that there is also a 30-40% possibility of an extended consolidation, but only if the market structure breaks—a scenario he considers unlikely. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Just Entered Neutral State – What This Means Looking at the chart, the analyst has identified two key upside targets and one downside scenario. If XRP/BTC crosses the red resistance line at approximately $0.0000338, Egrag Crypto predicts an initial surge to a “conservative” target of $0.000091, followed by a rise to a “normal” target of $0.00014. Conversely, if a structure break occurs, XRP/BTC could plunge from $0.0000193 to $0.00000668. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin At The Core: ARK Sees $28 Trillion Digital Asset Future",
    "body": "ARK Invest’s new roadmap puts a big number on the table, and it’s hard to ignore. Reports say Cathie Wood’s firm’s “Big Ideas 2026” research paints a scenario where the total value of crypto climbs to about $28 trillion by 2030. Related Reading: Trove’s New Token Craters 95%, Sparking Investor Revolt Big Ideas Point To A Shift According to ARK and its public writeups, that $28 trillion is not blind optimism. The firm breaks the future into three main drivers: Bitcoin, decentralized finance, and tokenized real-world assets. Reports note Bitcoin could make up roughly 70% of that total, which would mean about $16 trillion in Bitcoin market cap by 2030. DeFi And Tokenized Assets Take The Stage DeFi platforms and smart-contract networks are expected to grow a lot. ARK’s scenario puts smart money and on-chain services as a major contributor to market value in the run up to 2030. The firm also projects tokenized real-world assets — things like tokenized bonds, property shares, and other financial products moved onto ledgers — to climb into the trillions, with some reports pointing toward around $11 trillion for tokenization. How Bitcoin Fits Into The Picture Given the share ARK assigns to Bitcoin, the math pushes toward very large per-coin prices if that scenario plays out. Reports say ARK’s base case uses a little over 20 million Bitcoins in supply by 2030 and implies a per-coin price that could sit near the high hundreds of thousands — commonly quoted numbers range up to about $950,000 to $1,000,000 in that framework. Fast Growth Assumptions To reach $28 trillion, the forecast depends on very steep growth each year. ARK points to an implied compound annual growth rate near 61% from present levels to 2030. That is aggressive. It would mean rapid gains across many segments of the crypto market, not just a single rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sharp Reversal Leaves Over $800 Million Liquidated In 1 Day Reports and industry analysts warn that the path to that future has a long list of hurdles. Regulation must become clearer in many places. Institutional rails and custody tools need to expand and prove reliable. Market sentiment has to stay positive long enough for major capital flows to arrive. Any of these things going wrong would change the numbers quickly. ARK’s “Big Ideas 2026” details a robust vision of a $28 trillion ecosystem driven by Bitcoin, DeFi, and tokenization. Although it holds a rather ambitious 61% growth trajectory riddled with numerous regulatory and market obstacles, the vision reinforces the faith of ARK Invest in the transformation of the digital asset space from being a speculative domain to the nucleus of the global finance system.

    "title": "Bitcoin Supply In Profit Stalls At 71%: Still Not Enough For A Sustainable Recovery",
    "body": "Bitcoin is facing a critical test as volatility returns and price action remains unstable around the $90,000 level. Bulls are attempting to defend this psychological zone after recent turbulence, but confidence across the market is still fragile. With uncertainty dominating short-term sentiment, many traders are treating every bounce as a potential trap rather than the start of a confirmed recovery. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Power Shift: New Whales Now Control The Market According to top analyst Darkfost, the market is still missing a key ingredient for a sustainable bullish continuation: a broad base of investors sitting in profit. He argues that despite Bitcoin’s resilience, there are not yet enough participants in positive territory to build the kind of structural comfort that fuels long-lasting uptrends. This matters because latent profits are not inherently bearish. In healthy conditions, when most holders are in profit, the market tends to stabilize. Investors feel less pressure to sell, panic fades, and holding becomes easier. That environment often supports stronger trend development and reduces the risk of sharp downside reactions. Still, Darkfost warns that profit dynamics only help up to a point. When unrealized gains become extreme across the entire market, they can eventually turn into overhead supply, triggering corrective phases. Bitcoin’s Profit Structure Still Isn’t Bullish Enough Profit distribution across holders can become a double-edged sword for Bitcoin. When the supply in profit climbs above 95% and approaches 100%, unrealized gains stop being supportive and begin turning into overhead pressure. At those extremes, investors have little incentive to hold through volatility, and even small shocks can trigger profit-taking that fuels corrective phases. From a structural perspective, Darkfost argues the market needs to reclaim the 75% supply-in-profit threshold to rebuild a healthier foundation. Historically, Bitcoin has tended to sustain bullish conditions when this metric holds above that level, as most participants remain comfortable and less reactive to downside volatility. Right now, however, the market sits near 71%, after dropping as low as 64%. Darkfost notes that readings this low have often appeared near the early stages of bear markets, even when the headline drawdown looks relatively contained. In this case, the decline of roughly 31% was enough to push a large portion of recent buyers underwater, suggesting many entered late in the move. The recent rebound briefly lifted supply in profit back to 75%, but it failed to hold. That rejection likely reflects investors using the bounce to exit at breakeven or reduce losses. Going forward, reclaiming 75%–80% would signal stabilization, while further weakness could amplify panic-driven selling. Related Reading: Ethereum Supply Tightens On Binance As Reserves Hit Lowest Level Since 2016 Volatility Keeps Bulls on the Defensive Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize near the $90,000 mark after a volatile correction that reshaped the market structure over the past few months. The chart shows BTC printing a major peak around $125,000 before rolling over into a sharp selloff. Accelerating into November and eventually finding a local floor near the mid-$80,000s. That drop marked a decisive break in momentum and triggered a shift toward a lower range, where price has struggled to regain prior support levels. Since the rebound off the lows, Bitcoin has moved into a consolidation phase, repeatedly testing resistance around $92,000–$95,000 but failing to generate sustained continuation. Each recovery attempt has been met with selling pressure, suggesting that short-term supply is still active near former breakdown zones. The latest bounce back toward $90,000 signals buyers are defending the level. But the structure still looks fragile without a clean breakout. Related Reading: Binance Order Flow Suggests Ethereum Is In Correction Mode: Demand Still Missing Volume also reflects uncertainty, with higher activity during selloffs and more muted participation during rebounds. Bulls likely need to hold $88,000–$90,000 and reclaim the $92,000 region with conviction. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "X is rolling out a feature called Starterpacks that will let new users follow ready-made groups of accounts tied to specific interests. It’s designed to make finding people to follow faster, and yes — that includes lists focused on Bitcoin and other crypto topics. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sharp Reversal Leaves Over $800 Million Liquidated In 1 Day Reports say the company has spent months building these curated sets and plans to launch them in the coming weeks. Starterpacks Include Crypto And Hundreds Of Categories According To X’s product team, the feature will span more than 1,000 interest categories so people can join subject feeds without hunting around. Some packs will pull together prominent Bitcoin commentators, active traders and market watchers so newcomers land in front of the right conversations quickly. The idea echoes a feature that already exists on rival apps, but X’s lists are picked internally rather than built by users. Over the last few months, we scoured the world for the top posters in every niche & country We’ve compiled them into a new tool called Starterpacks: to help new users find the best accounts—big or small—for their interests ⬇️ Reply below with a topic you’re most interested in… pic.twitter.com/MYIIQAaJaL — Nikita Bier (@nikitabier) January 21, 2026 Why Crypto Is Getting Special Attention Reports note that crypto chatter on X cooled last year. Posts mentioning Bitcoin fell by a noticeable margin in 2025, according to platform watchers who track engagement. That slide appears to have pushed product staff to make it easier to surface crypto creators again. The change is meant to reduce friction for users who want to jump into market talk without following dozens of accounts one by one. A Look At How The Packs Work Each Starterpack groups a small set of accounts around a theme. Users can accept a pack as a starting point and then add or remove people just like that. Some packs will be regional, while others target hobbies or professional beats. The lists were assembled by the product team after a global search for active voices in each niche. In practice, this means a newly joined user could pick a crypto pack and instantly follow a mix of analysts, podcasters and traders. Community Reaction Has Been Mixed Crypto users on X had already been vocal about visibility and moderation. A number of creators welcomed any effort that helps their posts reach new readers. Other people worried that curated packs could favor certain voices over others or steer attention away from smaller accounts. Debate over how feeds are shaped is expected to continue as Starterpacks roll out. Related Reading: Trove’s New Token Craters 95%, Sparking Investor Revolt What To Watch Next Product updates will appear gradually. Reports say the rollout will start in the coming weeks, and X’s team will likely adjust the approach based on feedback. For people who follow Bitcoin and crypto, Starterpacks could mean quicker discovery and more steady streams of market talk. For the platform, it’s one more attempt to make joining feel less like starting from scratch. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from TradingView",

XRP price started a fresh decline below the $1.920 zone. The price is now trading below $1.9250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There are two bearish trend lines forming with resistance at $1.95 and $2.00 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it stays below $1.950. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price failed to stay above $2.00 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below $1.950 and $1.9350 to enter a short-term bearish zone. The price even spiked below $1.920. A low was formed at $1.90, and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a recovery wave above $1.9120. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.987 swing high to the $1.90 low, but the bears remained active. The price is now trading below $1.950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $1.9450 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.987 swing high to the $1.90 low. There are also two bearish trend lines forming with resistance at $1.95 and $2.00 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $2.00 level and the second trend line. A close above $2.00 could send the price to $2.050. The next hurdle sits at $2.10. A clear move above the $2.10 resistance might send the price toward the $2.120 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.150 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.20. Downside Break? If XRP fails to clear the $1.95 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.90 level. The next major support is near the $1.870 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.870 level, the price might continue to decline toward $1.8480. The next major support sits near the $1.820 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.7880. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

    "title": "Bitwise Says Crypto Has Likely Bottomed, Echoing Q1 2023 Setup",
    "body": "Bitwise Asset Management is arguing that crypto’s current drawdown has the fingerprints of a cyclical low: weak prices alongside strengthening on-chain and business fundamentals, a pattern the firm says last appeared in Q1 2023 before a multi-year rally. In its Q4 2025 “Crypto Market Review,” Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan frames the quarter as an unusually important inflection point precisely because the signals are not all moving in the same direction. “But sometimes—every once in a while—the charts are mixed,” Hougan wrote. “The last one I remember was Q1 2023. At the time, we were starting to rebound post-FTX, and the data was topsy-turvy; some up, some down, some sideways. In the two years that followed, crypto prices soared.” Bitwise’s core claim rests on a divergence between market performance and usage metrics in Q4. The firm notes that Ethereum fell 29% over the quarter, even as Ethereum and Layer 2 transactions “soared to new all-time highs (up 24.5%).” Crypto equities also sold off, down 20% in Q4 by Bitwise’s measure while the underlying companies’ revenues were “on pace to grow 3x faster than any other sector of the stock market,” according to the report.

The Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index fell 26.29% in Q4 and finished 2025 down 10.64% year-to-date; Bitcoin was down 23.48% in Q4 (down 6.26% in 2025), while Ethereum fell 28.59% in Q4 (down 11.03% in 2025). Yet the report also shows the market retaining scale: total crypto market capitalization stood at roughly $2.78 trillion as of Dec. 31, with bitcoin representing 63.6% and ether about 12.9%. Where Bitwise sees “green shoots” is in rails and revenue. The executive summary argues that “both stablecoin AUM and stablecoin transaction activity soared to new all-time highs,” presenting that as evidence a durable adoption wave is underway. Four Crypto Catalysts Bitwise Is Watching In 2026 Bitwise argues the market’s next leg will be shaped less by narrative rotation and more by identifiable catalysts, starting with US market-structure legislation. “All eyes are on the CLARITY Act,” the report says, describing it as a Senate-moving bill that could provide a “strong regulatory foundation” but also carries the risk of a weaker outcome or no bill at all. Related Reading: Trump Media Set to Issue Non-Transferable Crypto Tokens, Cutoff Date February 2 The second catalyst is what the firm calls a “stablecoin supercycle,” positioning stablecoins as payment infrastructure that is increasingly decoupled from directional crypto beta. Bitwise writes that 2025 annual stablecoin transaction volume topped $32 trillion, up 73% year-over-year, “more than doubling Visa’s volume through the first nine months of the year,” and says that data “confirm[s] their arrival in the mainstream.” The third is macro, specifically the coming change at the Federal Reserve. Bitwise notes Chair Jerome Powell’s “looming departure in May,” giving President Trump an opportunity to appoint new leadership. Between named candidates Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, Bitwise says Hassett is viewed as the more dovish on rates and fiscal policy, adding that a dovish appointment would increase the likelihood of rate cuts and “should drive crypto assets higher.” The fourth is plumbing: distribution at major US wealth platforms. Bitwise points to “initial wirehouse ETF flows” following Q4 approvals, writing that financial advisors at three of the four major wirehouses gained access to crypto ETFs in Q4 after previously being barred from recommending exposure. Those advisors “control ~$16 trillion in assets,” and Bitwise expects early flows to start slowly in Q1 before accelerating. Hougan stops short of calling any single variable decisive, but ties the bottom thesis to whether the underlying data keeps improving. He wrote he was drafting the memo on Jan. 16 after crypto had already begun posting strong early-year returns and added: “If the fundamental data in this report stays steady, I think that trend could continue.” At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.00 trillion.
