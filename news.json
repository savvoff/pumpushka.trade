There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $90,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it settles above the $90,500 zone. Bitcoin Price Aims Fresh Increase Bitcoin price failed to gain strength for a move above the $92,000 and $92,500 levels. BTC started a downside correction and traded below the $90,500 support. The price even spiked below the $88,000 support. However, the bulls were active near the $87,500 zone. A low was formed at $87,582 and the price is moving higher. There was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $93,561 swing high to the $87,582 low. Bitcoin is now trading below $90,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . If the bulls remain in action, the price could attempt another increase.

Any more gains might send the price toward the $93,200 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $94,000 and $94,500. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $90,500 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $88,550 level. The first major support is near the $88,000 level. The next support is now near the $87,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $86,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $85,000, below which BTC might accelerate lower in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone.

    "body": "Hashdex is out with its 2026 crypto investment outlook, and the vibe is pretty clear: stop treating crypto like a weird side-bet and start treating it like… an allocation. The firm’s CIO Samir Kerbage says “most investors” should be thinking in the 5–10% range, framing it as a pragmatic response to a messier macro regime (sticky inflation risk, debt burdens, the 60/40 portfolio looking less like a law of nature and more like a historical artifact). Look, you can debate the exact number, but Hashdex’s point is that the underweight has become the active decision. Crypto is now “well above $3 trillion” in market cap and about 1% of the global investable market by its math—meaning a sub-1% allocation is basically a deliberate fade. They also cite a Charles Schwab survey where 45% of financial advisors said they planned to allocate to crypto ETFs over the next year. And they’re not just waving their hands. Hashdex runs a simple portfolio thought experiment: adding crypto exposure (represented by the Nasdaq Crypto Index US) to a 60/40 improves risk-adjusted returns in their backtest window, with higher allocations juicing total return while, yes, drawdowns get uglier. That trade-off isn’t hidden — it’s the whole point of sizing the position instead of YOLO’ing it. Related Reading: Crypto Tanks After Fed Cut: Santiment Breaks Down The Trap But the meat of the report isn’t “buy crypto because number go up.” It’s three themes, three predictions — basically a roadmap for what they think does the heavy lifting in 2026. Top 3 Crypto Predictions For 2026 First up: the “cryptodollar”. Hashdex argues stablecoins are starting to do something geopolitically weird and financially consequential: while some sovereigns try to de-dollarize, stablecoins re-dollarize at the user and corporate level, with issuers recycling that demand into short-duration Treasuries. Their baseline is stablecoins going from roughly $295 billion to well over $500 billion in 2026. If that accelerates, they suggest it changes the shape of Treasury demand — in one scenario, stablecoin growth could shorten the average duration of US debt by around four months (because the backing skews short). That’s the kind of detail bond people obsess over. Crypto people probably should, too. Related Reading: Will The Crypto Market Benefit From The Trump Fed Takeover? Second: tokenization finally acting like a flywheel instead of a conference slide. Hashdex points to tokenized RWAs at roughly $36 billion as of late 2025 and says the market could grow 10x to about $400 billion by end-2026. They also flag that tokenized Treasury bills have already climbed to over $8 billion, from a little above $700 million two years earlier. They namecheck real-world rollout examples — BlackRock’s liquidity fund, Franklin Templeton’s on-chain government money fund, UBS’s tokenized VCC fund in Singapore, Siemens’ on-chain bond — as proof this isn’t just crypto teams talking to themselves anymore. “We’re not spending enough time talking about how quickly we’re going to tokenize every financial asset.” Third: AI, but not the “add AI to the pitch deck” version. Hashdex says decentralized AI networks pulled nearly $1 billion in venture funding in 2025, largely aimed at problems like verification, coordination, and compute cost. Their call is the “AI Crypto” segment growing from about $3 billion to $10 billion in 2026. The throughline is simple even if the plumbing isn’t: stablecoins deepen on-chain liquidity, tokenization pulls more assets onto rails, and AI pushes demand for crypto-native infrastructure that can verify and coordinate without a single gatekeeper. Hashdex’s punchline is that 2026 is when “exploratory” turns into “strategic.” Not a tidy ending, sure — but markets rarely give you one. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.03 trillion. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin Holds Demand Zone Above $0.13, What A Bounce Would Do",
    "body": "As the eventful year of 2025 draws to an end, crypto analysts are looking into what the Dogecoin price could hold for investors going into the end of the year. One of these analysts is BitGuru, who shared an interest in the Dogecoin price chart, highlighting the next possible roadmap that the meme coin could take. With the possibility of a bounce rising, the next targets have become increasingly important to identify in order to maximize gains. Why The Dogecoin Price Could Recover Quickly BitGuru’s analysis focuses on the rising demand surrounding the meme coin after finding support from the recent crash. The Dogecoin price had stopped above $0.13, suggesting that the demand at this level continues to hold strong as buyers return to the market. Related Reading: Reasons Why XRP’s Technical Structure Favors Upside Than Down Over Next 6 Months Pointing out this demand, the crypto analyst explains that the Dogecoin price is actually holding the demand zone after a prolonged downtrend. This is often bullish for the digital asset as it shows rising interest in the cryptocurrency as it establishes new support levels. This base formation, as the analyst calls it, could serve as the starting point for the next rally that could push the Dogecoin price higher. However, for this to happen, the Dogecoin bulls would have to maintain their position above this demand level. If this support level is held, then BitGuru forecasts that the Dogecoin price could start to recover again. This bounce could lead to a 50% increase, with the analyst’s chart outline putting it as high as $0.188. The upper end of the rally shows the price climbing to $0.22 before hitting resistance. End Of Year Could End Red Interestingly, the last quarter of the year has often been reasonably bullish for the Dogecoin price, but the year 2025 has deviated hard. So far, the quarter is already 41.8% deep in the red, according to data from the CryptoRank website, and it doesn’t look like that would change anytime soon. Related Reading: XRP Mirrors 2016 Trend That Led To 69% Crash Before 110,000% Rally The Dogecoin price is already down more than 7.5% in the month of December so far, contributing to the decline that has been felt in the quarter. The months of October and November ended in the red with 20% and 21.3% losses, respectively, and if this trend continues, then the Dogecoin price could follow suit.

    "title": "Why Did The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP Prices Crash, And Will It Continue?",
    "body": "Crypto pundit Crypto Wimar has explained why the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP prices crashed, highlighting the continuous selling pressure. The crypto market is also at risk of further downward pressure due to macro factors such as the impending Japan rate hike. Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP Prices Crashed In an X post, Crypto Wimar revealed that Wintermute has dumped 40% of its holdings over the last three weeks, which has contributed to the crash in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP prices. The crypto pundit further noted that the market maker is still dumping millions in BTC and ETH on Binance, which puts these coins at risk of further declines. Related Reading: What’s Happening With The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Recently? The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP prices are also crashing as crypto market investors brace for a Japan interest rate hike by the BOJ at their December 19 meeting. Polymarket data shows that there is currently a 97.4% chance that the BOJ will increase rates by 25 basis points. A Japan rate hike impacts the crypto market as it puts the yen carry trade in focus, with investors moving to sell their assets before the yen strengthens and their debt becomes more expensive. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP prices have crashed after every Fed rate cut this year. This similar price action is playing out as the Fed lowered rates by 25 bps last week. These crypto assets had seen a notable rebound prior to the Fed rate decision last week, indicating that the cut was already priced in. Demand for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP also appears to be dwindling, even among institutional investors. Crypto analytics platform CryptoQuant stated that Bitcoin treasury growth is losing momentum, noting that the accumulation pace is slowing despite the fact that 117 new companies added BTC to their treasuries this year. Ethereum treasury company BitMine is also the only company that has continued to accumulate ETH at an impressive pace amid this market downturn. BTC At Risk Of Drop Below $50,000 Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has indicated that the Bitcoin price could still drop below $50,000, which also puts Ethereum and XRP at risk of crashing. In an X post, the analyst raised the possibility that a BTC bear pennant is forming. Related Reading: Why Is The Bitcoin Price Down Again? Analyst Calls Out Trading Desk For Triggering Crashes He noted that this is not a structure that market investors will typically want to see in a bull market. Titan of Crypto added that the structure is still developing, but it is one that is worth monitoring closely. Meanwhile, the analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin price could drop below $50,000 as soon as February next year. It is worth mentioning that veteran trader Peter Brandt had also earlier predicted that BTC could drop below $50,000 based on his belief that the flagship crypto is already in a bear market.

    "title": "Why XRP Isn’t Reacting to Major Institutional and Regional Developments",
    "body": "XRP has spent the past several weeks moving sideways around the $2.00 level, even as headlines around Ripple and the broader XRP ecosystem continue to stack up. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holds Demand Zone Above $0.13, What A Bounce Would Do From a $300 million venture fund expansion into South Korea to nearly $1 billion in spot ETF inflows and fresh regulatory approvals, the backdrop appears supportive on paper. However, price action tells a different story. Instead of responding to institutional traction and regional growth, XRP remains locked in a tight range, reflecting a disconnect between developments and market behavior. XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Institutional Growth Isn’t Translating Into Token Demand Ripple’s expansion into South Korea through a $300 million venture fund has drawn attention due to the involvement of well-established, Seoul-based asset managers. However, market participants are increasingly viewing this move as tied to Ripple’s corporate strategy and potential IPO positioning, rather than direct demand for XRP. Institutional investors tend to prioritize predictable cash-flow or equity-style exposure, limiting the immediate impact such initiatives have on the token’s market dynamics. A similar pattern is visible in the ETF market. Spot XRP ETFs have recorded roughly $990 million in inflows over 30 consecutive days, making them one of the fastest-growing crypto fund segments. Despite this, XRP has fallen more than 12% over the past month. Analysts note that ETF inflows do not always translate into spot market pressure, especially when liquidity is fragmented or offset by broader risk-off sentiment across crypto assets. Technical Pressure and Broader Market Headwinds From a technical standpoint, XRP remains under pressure. The price has retraced to key Fibonacci levels after falling from its yearly high near $3.65. Chart patterns such as a developing death cross and a double-top formation point to downside risk, with support levels around $1.63 and $1.50 in focus if selling continues. Traders describe the current phase as bearish consolidation, with strong resistance clustered between $2.00 and $2.20. These conditions mirror weakness across the wider crypto market. Bitcoin’s decline from earlier highs and drawdowns in major altcoins have reduced risk appetite, often pulling XRP lower regardless of asset-specific news. Liquidity, Bots, and Muted Price Response Market structure may also be playing a role. Analysts point to low trading volumes and heavy arbitrage activity as factors keeping XRP pinned near psychological levels. In thin markets, automated strategies tend to fade moves quickly, preventing follow-through. While some data suggests tokens are gradually moving off exchanges, signaling longer-term holding, short-term price discovery remains dominated by macro flows and Bitcoin-led volatility.

    "title": "Market Stress Continues As Bitcoin STH SOPR Dips Below 1– When Will The Pain End?",
    "body": "Bitcoin continues to struggle below the $90,000 level, failing to reclaim key resistance as bulls attempt to defend current demand zones. Price action reflects a market under pressure, with momentum fading after a prolonged correction. From its all-time high, Bitcoin has now retraced roughly 30%, placing the asset firmly in a corrective phase where uncertainty and caution dominate trading behavior. Related Reading: Ethereum Trades Near Whales’ Cost Basis For The Fourth Time Since 2021 – Historic Test According to a report from Axel Adler, on-chain data confirms that market stress is no longer limited to price alone. Two key indicators—the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR) and the P/L Block—are signaling broad loss realization among participants and a deterioration in overall market sentiment. These metrics provide insight into the behavior of short-term holders, who are often the most sensitive to price swings and macro uncertainty. Together, these signals suggest that Bitcoin remains in a fragile state, where confidence has weakened, and recovery attempts face increasing resistance. STH SOPR and P/L Block Confirm Capitulation Pressure Adler explains that the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR) measures whether coins held for less than 155 days are being sold at a profit or a loss. When the indicator falls below one, it signals that recent buyers are realizing losses. Currently, the 7-day moving average of STH SOPR has slipped into the red zone, with a reading near 0.99. This confirms that short-term holders are, on average, selling Bitcoin below their acquisition price—a behavior typically associated with heightened stress and emotional selling. Historically, similar SOPR conditions have marked local capitulation phases, when selling pressure peaks and weaker hands exit the market. As long as the SOPR 7-day average remains below one, short-term participants stay in “stress mode.” Adler notes that a meaningful improvement would require a sustained move back above one on a daily close, signaling that sellers have exhausted supply and buyers are once again absorbing sell-side pressure. Complementing this signal, the P/L Block indicator tracks the aggregated profit and loss state of market participants. The current red block reflects loss dominance, with a P/L Score of minus three—classified as pronounced stress. With Bitcoin down 30% from its all-time high and 30-day returns negative, both indicators align, reinforcing a clear picture of capitulation among short-term holders. Related Reading: XRP Whale Activity Spikes At The Bottom – A Classic Pre-Rally Signal Bitcoin Price Analysis: Weekly Structure Remains Critical The weekly chart shows Bitcoin trading around the $89,900 level after a sharp rejection from the $120,000–$125,000 region. Price has retraced aggressively but is now attempting to stabilize above the rising 200-week moving average (green), a level that has historically defined long-term trend validity. So far, this area is acting as dynamic support, suggesting that buyers are defending higher-cycle structure despite broader market weakness. However, Bitcoin remains below the 50-week moving average (blue), which is now sloping downward. This configuration reflects a loss of medium-term momentum and confirms that the market is still in a corrective phase rather than a resumed uptrend. The 100-week moving average (red) continues to rise well below price, reinforcing that the broader macro trend remains intact, but also highlighting how much excess was built during the prior rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Refuse to Sell: Historic Signal Emerges As Binance CDD Drops To 2017 Levels Volume has declined during the recent consolidation, signaling indecision rather than aggressive accumulation. This typically precedes a volatility expansion. From a structural perspective, holding above the $85,000–$88,000 zone is critical. A sustained breakdown below the 200-week MA would increase the probability of a deeper retracement toward the $75,000–$80,000 region. Conversely, reclaiming the 50-week MA near $95,000 would be an early signal that downside pressure is fading. Until then, Bitcoin remains range-bound, with long-term support holding but momentum still fragile. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "The Bitcoin price outlook remains under scrutiny as market analysts assess whether the world’s largest cryptocurrency can still reach $140,000. Given BTC’s recent downturn and fluctuating price, it’s understandable that a dramatic surge to $140,000 could be viewed skeptically. However, the analyst points to global M2 Money Supply, highlighting its correlation with Bitcoin and its support for a significant upside move. New discussions have emerged in the crypto space about the relationship between the Bitcoin price action and the global M2 Money Supply. Pseudonymous crypto analyst ‘MoneyLord’ has projected a massive price surge to $140,000 for BTC based on M2 data. The analyst noted that many people are skeptical about the relevance of M2 Money Supply, likely questioning whether it still holds predictive value for Bitcoin’s performance. Global M2 Money Supply To Fuel $140,000 Bitcoin Price Surge According to MoneyLord, the recent disconnect between Bitcoin and M2 data should not be viewed as a failure of the model, but rather as a consequence of aggressive market interference and increased stress across global financial systems. In his technical report released on X, he argued that, without heavy manipulation and the collapse and insolvency of major entities, Bitcoin would have continued to track global liquidity growth. Related Reading: Is It More Profitable To Hold Bitcoin For The Short-Term? 2025 Numbers Are Here MoneyLord believes that those shocks temporarily suppressed BTC’s price expansion, likely contributing to its recent decline and slow momentum. With market conditions somewhat stabilizing, the analyst suggests that Bitcoin is poised to realign with global M2 Money Supply trends, potentially setting the stage for renewed upward momentum. From this perspective, the current phase is viewed as a delayed reaction rather than a failed cycle. MoneyLord predicts that if Bitcoin begins to catch up with M2 data, the cryptocurrency’s price could hit a target above $140,000 sooner than the market expects. The accompanying chart illustrates this bullish outlook, showing global liquidity, represented by the blue line, continuing to rise toward the projected price. With Bitcoin trading near $90,000 after a more than 6% decline this month, a rally to $140,000 would require a gain of at least 55%. Reaching this level would set a new all-time high, exceeding its present peak of over $126,000 by more than 10%. Bitcoin Shows Resilience Amid Market Sell-Offs According to crypto analyst Don, Bitcoin has bounced back after a period of sharp sell-offs that shook out many traders and triggered widespread liquidations. The analyst noted that bulls have stepped in to reclaim critical support and restore confidence in the market as BTC resumes trading within a well-defined ascending triangle pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Losses From Entities Surges To 2022 Levels Following Crash Below $90,000 The chart shows that the triangle has an upper boundary near $94,324 and a lower boundary around $89,241.
