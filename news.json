    "title": "Ethereum Staking Queue Grows: What Does This Mean For ETH Prices Moving Forward?",
    "body": "As Ethereum (ETH) recently reclaimed key levels above $3,200, the dynamics within its staking system have shifted significantly. For the first time in nearly six months, the entry queue for staking Ethereum now exceeds the exit queue, a development viewed by many as a bullish indicator for ETH prices. Currently, a substantial 1.32 million ETH is waiting to be staked, with an average wait time of 23 days, while only about 3,000 ETH are queued for withdrawal, which takes merely an hour, indicating a net increase in locked ETH rather than unlocked coins. Bullish Signals For Ethereum Analysts at Bull Theory suggest that historically, significant spikes in entry queues occur when investor confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential rises. In contrast, increases in exit queues are often associated with market fear or forced sell-offs. Presently, the landscape shows rising entry demand, decreasing exit pressure, and an overall increase in net lock-up, a combination that has frequently been observed before stronger bullish cycles for ETH. Related Reading: XRP Surges Towards $2.20: Leading Monday Gains And Driving Crypto ETF Inflows Compounding this positive sentiment is the current high level of network activity. Daily transactions on the Ethereum network are trending upwards, indicating that market participants are actively engaging with the platform rather than leaving it. Enhanced network usage leads to increased ETH burning, contributing to a supply crunch that further supports the asset’s value. According to the analysts, institutional investment is one of the notable drivers behind the current surge in staking. In just the past two weeks, BitMine – the public company with the largest Ethereum holdings – has staked around $2.58 billion worth of ETH, signaling a long-term commitment to the asset and suggesting growing institutional interest in the digital asset. Key Factors Suggest A Significant Upswing Ahead This development comes ahead of potential catalysts that could further boost staking demand. While the BlackRock Ethereum staking ETF is still awaiting approval, its eventual green light could grant access to a broader pool of traditional capital, thereby enhancing the overall staking demand for ETH. Additionally, ETH has successfully broken out of a three-month downward trend. If it can reclaim levels between $3,500 and $3,600, the analysts predict that a substantial rally could follow. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches $93,000 Amid Renewed Optimism: What To Keep An Eye On This Week As of now, ETH has recovered by 11% in the past two weeks according to CoinGecko data, positioning the token just below these key levels at $3,270. This performance has even surpassed that of Bitcoin (BTC), which has recorded gains of just 6% in the same time frame. Taking into account additional factors such as the anticipated approval of the BlackRock ETF and the potential for regulatory clarity through the passing of the Market Structure Bill, also known as the Clarity Act, Ethereum appears to be in a strong position to experience a significant rally in 2026.

    "title": "XRP Rally Reopens The $8–$12 Zone Debate, Says Will Taylor",
    "body": "XRP has jumped roughly 25% off its recent lows (at one point), and Cryptoinsightuk co-founder Will Taylor says the move has reopened the debate over whether XRP is starting a larger impulse that could ultimately point toward the $8–$12 zone or whether it’s a short-term squeeze that needs to cool first. Taylor said he’s “up in the air” on the immediate next step, even as he remains long. His hesitation is rooted in a simple conflict: the lower timeframes look stretched, but XRP has a track record of accelerating after momentum spikes rather than immediately mean-reverting. What The XRP Charts Tell Us On the hourly, Taylor noted XRP’s RSI has repeatedly hit overbought territory and “we’ve crossed bearish on the hour,” a short-term warning that often precedes pullbacks or sideways digestion. On the four-hour, he described RSI as “about as high as I’ve pretty much ever seen it,” and tried to contextualize what happened the last few times XRP got similarly overheated. In one prior episode, he said XRP pulled back briefly, then continued higher by “a further like 36%.” In another, he described a rally sequence where price consolidated and then ran again, adding “another 129%” into the next leg. Related Reading: Same XRP Setup That Led To Over 1,000% Increase In 2017 Is Playing Out Again That’s the core of his dilemma: overbought conditions can be a sell signal in many markets, but Taylor argues XRP’s strongest phases often begin with RSI entering overbought, not ending there. “When XRP’s daily RSI gets overbought, XRP rips in price a lot of the time,” he said, pushing back on the reflex to fade strength. On the daily chart, he highlighted what he sees as a constructive technical shift. XRP has closed above a short-term range that previously capped price for multiple days, and printed its “highest daily close in XRP since the 13th of November.” Taylor emphasized how quickly XRP cleared that ceiling this time: after multiple failed attempts in the prior weeks, “we break straight through.” XRP Price Targets From there, Taylor laid out the upside logic using historical RSI analogs. He said three previous daily overbought signals during the current cycle coincided with major extensions, citing moves of roughly 414% in one instance and 36% and 49% in others. He framed this as pattern recognition rather than prediction: “this is complete fact,” he said, referring to the historical relationship between daily RSI overbought and subsequent upside but he still translated those rough percentages into possible zones. A smaller continuation on the order of ~39% would, in his words, take XRP to around $3.13. A larger extension could revisit all-time highs near $3.66. The most aggressive interpretation, aligned with his broader wave thesis, would move XRP “up towards our goals of like $8 to $12 for this wave.” Related Reading: Only 1 Week Left As XRP RSI Breakout Sets Up $10 Path, Analyst Predicts Structurally, Taylor said the market is at a point where multiple Elliott Wave counts can be argued. He sketched competing interpretations: XRP may be working through an ABC-type move off the lows, may be approaching a fifth wave higher, or could still be in an extended third wave within a larger five-wave advance. “My honest answer is right now I don’t know,” he said. Even without committing to a wave count, Taylor said the “impulsive” character of the rally stands out. He pointed to “the length of these candles supported by volume” across exchanges, arguing the move looks different from earlier, more corrective price action. For him, the practical test is near-term continuation: he wants to see “some more really aggressive candles” over the next day or two to support the idea that XRP is leading a broader leg rather than squeezing and stalling. Liquidity is the other piece he’s watching. Taylor said XRP has “on the hourly taken most of our upside liquidity,” while flagging downside liquidity zones around $1.70 down to $1.66. He said in established trends he would “expect a continuation to the upside,” but those downside pools, combined with stretched RSI and nearby resistance on XRP’s relative pairs, keep him from treating the current level as a clean new entry. Taylor said these mixed signals are why he has considered reducing leverage on his XRP long, noting he is “90% spot.” His bottom line was simple: XRP has delivered “a fantastic aggressive move,” but the next few sessions matter. 29 minutes of $XRP TA. pic.twitter.com/aJ4yiC7Sdr — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) January 6, 2026 If XRP keeps printing strong daily candles and the relative pairs start closing above resistance, his $8–$12 zone framing remains a live bull-case roadmap. If not, the same overbought signals and nearby liquidity pockets increase the odds that XRP first resets through consolidation or a retracement before any larger leg can develop. At press time, XRP traded at $2.25. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US opened 2026 with a burst of cash that surprised some market watchers and encouraged others. Related Reading: Bitcoin Wealth Isn’t About Hype—It’s About Time And Stacking, Expert Says According to Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, more than $1.2 billion flowed into those funds during the first two trading days of the year. He estimated that if that pace held, annualized inflows could reach about $150 billion — roughly 600% higher than the total for 2025. The spot Bitcoin ETFs are “coming into 2026 like a lion,” Balchunas said. ETF Flows Surge Early According to reports, nearly every major spot Bitcoin ETF saw money coming in during those opening sessions. Balchunas calls this inflow as broad-based. The WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) was one of the few exceptions that did not register the same demand. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was reported to have taken a large share of last year’s buying. The spot bitcoin ETFs are coming into 2026 like a lion, +$1.2 in flows in first two days of year w/ everyone eating. That’s a $150b/yr pace. Told ya’ll if they can take in $22b when it’s raining, imagine when the sun is shining. pic.twitter.com/YdRaLN0Op7 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 6, 2026 Traditional Measures Fell Short Last Year Last year, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows of over $21 billion. That was down from $35 billion in 2024. Yet Monday’s single-day net inflow of $697 million was the biggest daily intake in three months, and it came as Bitcoin traded back above the low $90,000s. Trading volume rose and some positions that had bet on a price drop were closed, which added to the move. Institutional Moves And New Filings Reports show Morgan Stanley filed with the SEC to offer both Bitcoin and Solana ETFs, a step that puts a major wealth manager alongside established issuers. Balchunas pointed out Morgan Stanley manages about $8 trillion in advisory assets and has already cleared its advisors to allocate to such products. The firm’s proposed Bitcoin trust, according to the filing, would track the spot price and avoid leverage or derivatives. How The Flows Affect The Market Analysts say ETF demand is likely to soak up circulating Bitcoin supply. If sustained, that dynamic could change how much liquidity is available to traders and might reduce the amount of BTC offered on exchanges. There was an early sign of unevenness: preliminary figures showed a large outflow from one Fidelity fund on Tuesday, which raised the chance of a net outflow for the day once all data were in.

The top crypto asset kept its composure around the low $90,000s and climbed past $93,000 at moments. Traders and analysts pointed to short position liquidations and a rebound in other risk assets as reasons for the lift. Some on-chain observers flagged accumulation by larger holders, while others said markets were treating the news as concluded rather than as a fresh shock.

    "title": "Catalysts That Suggests The Dogecoin Price Rally Could Continue",
    "body": "Several catalysts have emerged that point to a sustained upward momentum for the Dogecoin price. This comes amid DOGE’s 26% gain to begin the year, with the meme coin now looking to break above the $0.15 resistance. Factors That Could Contribute To A Sustained Dogecoin Price Rally One factor pointing to a sustained Dogecoin price rally is the recent inflows into DOGE ETFs. SoSoValue data show that Bitwise and Grayscale’s funds have recorded net inflows on two of the three trading days this year. Notably, the Dogecoin ETFs recorded inflows of $2.30 million and $1.60 million on January 2 and 5, respectively. This marked the first consecutive daily net inflows since December 3 last year. Related Reading: Analyst Says the Worst Is Over For Dogecoin, Predicts Rally To $0.8 The daily net inflows into the DOGE ETFs indicate a renewed interest among institutional investors in the meme coin, which is a positive for the Dogecoin price. DOGE could see a sustained rally if the inflows into these funds continue. Notably, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that a 2x Dogecoin ETF has had the best start to the year among all ETFs, up almost 40%. Furthermore, activity in the derivatives market also supports a sustained rally for the Dogecoin price. CoinGlass data shows that traders on top exchanges such as Binance and OKX are currently long. The long/short ratio on Binance is 2.06, well above 1. The long/short ratio for top traders on Binance is at 2.5, which is also a huge positive. Further data from CoinGlass also shows that the derivatives trading volume has surged over 2% to $5.60 billion. However, open interest has dropped by almost 7% to $1.78 billion, likely due to the market volatility as long positions were wiped out. DOGE Eyes Break Above $0.15 Crypto analyst ZiP stated in an X post that on the daily chart, the Dogecoin price is currently reacting to a local resistance at around $0.15. He further remarked that if the $0.15 resistance breaks, the next zone that the DOGE price may aim for is around $0.24. The analyst noted that this is where the first significant Fibonacci level, measured from the entire bearish move, is located. Meanwhile, ZiP mentioned that an additional reference point is the daily pivot at $0.1288, which he noted in the short term defines the market’s equilibrium level. Crypto analyst Trader Tarigrade revealed that the Dogecoin price has broken out of a falling wedge, showing strong upward momentum. Based on this, he predicted that DOGE is ready for a major surge, although he warned that the meme coin might retrace briefly. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Rally To All-Time Highs If It Breaks This Resistance Level At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.148, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "Bitcoin, ETH, Dogecoin Rally Faces 3 Key Checkpoints: Bitwise CIO",
    "body": "Crypto entered 2026 with a sharp bid, and Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says the next leg higher hinges on three checkpoints that have less to do with chart patterns and more to do with market plumbing, Washington, and the broader risk backdrop. In a January 6 memo, Hougan wrote that Bitcoin and Ethereum were each up 7% year-to-date as of Monday, January 5, while higher-beta names had moved faster, Dogecoin was up 29% over the same window. The question, he argued, is whether that early strength can turn into something sustained rather than a fleeting January pop. Three Hurdles To Overcome For Bitcoin, ETH And Dogecoin Hougan’s framework starts with a memory the market would rather bury: October 10, 2025, when crypto saw what he called “the largest liquidation event in its history,” with “$19 billion in futures positions wiped out in a single day.” The mechanical damage mattered, but the psychological overhang may have mattered more. In the weeks that followed, he wrote, investors worried the cascade had “impaired major market makers and/or hedge funds—perhaps fatally,” raising the specter of forced selling as large players unwound. “One of the reasons crypto struggled to rally in Q4 was that investors worried one of these big players might have to wind down operations, a process that typically requires the forced sale of assets,” Hougan wrote. “These potential sales hung over the market like a heavy fog.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Accumulation: Data Shows Institutions Are Net Buyers Again His first hurdle, then, is simply the absence of another blow-up with similar systemic implications. On that front, he struck a notably confident tone. “The good news: If it were going to happen, it probably would have happened by now,” he wrote, adding that while “there’s no guarantee,” a firm shutting down would likely have tried “to wrap up by year’s end.” In his read, part of the early-2026 rally reflects a market that has “put October 10 in the rearview.” He labeled that hurdle a “Green Light.” The second checkpoint is legislative, and far less within the market’s control: passage of the crypto market structure bill known as the CLARITY Act. Hougan wrote the bill is “winding its way through Congress,” with the Senate “targeting January 15 for markup,” the stage where committees align drafts and try to move a final bill toward a vote. He did not present it as a clean glide path. “Hurdles remain,” he wrote, citing “competing visions of how to regulate DeFi, stablecoin rewards, and political conflicts of interest.” Still, he framed markup as a pivotal gate: if CLARITY clears that process, it would be “a huge step toward approval.” Related Reading: Bitcoin At A Crossroads: $93,500 Reclaim Holds The Key For Next Move Hougan’s core argument is about durability. “Passage of the CLARITY Act is key to the long-term future of crypto in the U.S.,” he wrote. “Without legislation, the current pro-crypto regulatory tilt at the SEC, CFTC, and other agencies could reverse under a new administration. Passage of the Act would enshrine core principles into law and provide a strong foundation for future growth.” He pointed to signals from both politics and prediction markets. White House crypto czar David Sacks, Hougan wrote, says “we are closer than ever” to passing the bill. Kalshi, he added, puts the odds at 46% by May and 82% by year’s end. Hougan’s own takeaway: “I’m cautiously optimistic.” He tagged this hurdle “Yellow Light.” The third checkpoint is the one crypto traders often prefer to dismiss, until it matters: equity-market stability. Hougan argued the market doesn’t need a roaring stock rally to support crypto, noting “crypto is not highly correlated with stocks.” But he drew a hard line around drawdowns that force broad deleveraging and risk-off positioning. “A sharp collapse—say, a 20% pullback in the S&P 500—would take the shine off of all risk assets in the short term, crypto included,” he wrote. Here, he was explicit about limits: “I can’t claim any special expertise on the equity markets.” While he noted some investors are worried about an AI bubble, he pointed to prediction markets that “see a relatively low probability of a recession in 2026 and a roughly 80% probability of S&P 500 gains.” Like the CLARITY Act, he labeled the equity backdrop a “Yellow Light.” Hougan closed by arguing the setup is constructive if those remaining yellows turn green. “There is a lot to like in the crypto market right now,” he wrote, pointing to growing institutional adoption, surging real-world use cases “like stablecoins and tokenization,” and the market “starting to feel the benefits of the pro-crypto regulatory push that started in January 2025.” If the three milestones fall into place, he added, “2026’s early momentum will have some serious legs.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,717.

    "title": "Here’s Why the Bitcoin Price Was Able To Break $94,000",
    "body": "Bitcoin has kicked off 2026 on a good note, starting with the price breaking through the $94,000 barrier in early January, a threshold it hadn’t traded at for weeks. The surge wasn’t the result of a single cause, but rather a convergence of changing power between buying and selling pressure, improving institutional interest, on-chain signals pointing to a stabilizing market, and unexpected political developments in Venezuela that seem to have contributed to an appetite for risk assets. Geopolitical Risk-On Sentiment And Institutional Flows One of the important forces behind Bitcoin’s push towards $94,000 was the willingness among investors to take on risk across global markets, a mood shift that was shaped in part by dramatic political developments in Venezuela. News that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was captured by US forces caused a chain reaction through equities, commodities and crypto, lifting risk-on sentiment as traders assessed the broader economic and geopolitical implications of the event. Perhaps the most interesting news event is the chatter around a potential Venezuelan shadow $60 billion Bitcoin reserve. This backdrop of rising confidence played into a broader return of institutional capital to Bitcoin. US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs posted significant net inflows at the start of 2026, with $116.95 million coming in on Friday, January 2 and $123.52 million coming in on Monday, January 5. These inflows helped lift the price of Bitcoin back into the low $90,000s and provided traction as buyers stepped in after the new year holiday lull. On-Chain Metrics Shows A Changing Market Tone According to analytical data from Glassnode, Bitcoin’s market structure is stabilizing in the $80,000 to $95,000 range, sell pressure is beginning to fade, and momentum is beginning to recover. Momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index have moved into an upper-neutral zone, which shows a build-up in upside potential. Spot liquidity, though still thin, has expanded modestly without signs of speculative excess. Related Reading: Same XRP Setup That Led To Over 1,000% Increase In 2017 Is Playing Out Again Glassnode noted that open interest is rebuilding cautiously and that options markets point to short-term volatility, which is a sign of both increasing participation and lingering sensitivity to profit-taking. On-chain activity also shows a reduction in sell-side aggression alongside modestly improving spot volumes. However, Glassnode noted that structural demand is still subdued, and this places the recovery above $90,000 as a fragile one. Bitcoin Price Momentum. Source: @glassnode on X Related Reading: Early XRP Investors Sell-Offs Keep Price Low, Here’s How They’re Doing It These on-chain activities, alongside news events, worked together to help Bitcoin clear a technical hurdle at $90,000 which served as resistance throughout December 2025. The question now is whether this move signals the start of a sustained advance back above $100,000 or a temporary peak within a still-uneven market landscape. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $92,780, down by 0.5% from its intraday high of $94,343. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "The XRP price exploded from $0.5 in 2024 to over $3 in 2025. In the span of a few months, the cryptocurrency, which had been suppressed, made history and was only a few percentage points away from revisiting its all-time high. According to a crypto analyst, XRP may soon replicate its legendary 2017 rally, potentially reaching a new all-time high in the next three months. XRP To See Parabolic Rally In Three Months Market expert @Cryptobilbuwoo0 has shared a bullish outlook on XRP, pointing to a familiar price structure that closely mirrors the 2017 market cycle. According to the analyst, XRP began its powerful breakout near $3.60 in 2017, then skyrocketed to its ATH around $3.84 in 2018. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Analysts Predict 330% XRP Price Surge After This Happens He pointed out that in 2017, once the price broke above the dotted support line, which represented a long rising diagonal trend on the chart, XRP reached its $3.6 target within a week. Notably, this move delivered gains of approximately 1,184.86%. Based on the rally’s speed and intensity, the analyst suggests that XRP could be poised for another sharp surge, claiming that investors’ lives could change dramatically over the next 2 to 3 months. Notably, @Cryptobilbuwoo0’s chart analysis shows that XRP is already breaking out from a clearly defined base, having held above the same rising diagonal support line from 2017. At the same time, the breakout occurs as price reclaims the 52-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a level that previously marked the beginning of strong upside expansion for XRP. Fibonacci Extensions on the chart further highlight the 1.618 level as a key upside target, in line with the 2017 cycle peak structure. The chart also marks TP1 and TP2 zones, where the price paused briefly in 2017 before continuing higher. These shallow pullbacks were quickly bought, signaling strong trend control in the previous cycle. Current projections suggest a strong and sustained upward momentum following XRP’s breakout above the dotted support line. For its first target, price is expected to rally toward TP1 at $23.2, representing a massive 1,183.38% increase. Beyond this level, XRP is projected to continue its rally toward TP2 around $136.3, signaling a potentially historic upside. Remarkably, @Cryptobilbuwoo0’s chart suggests that all of these parabolic moves could unfold before the end of 2026. Momentum Indicators Support Bullish XRP Forecast XRP is currently trading above $2.2, up more than 21% in the past week. Given the cryptocurrency’s historically slow price movements, @Cryptobilbuwoo0’s forecast of a rise to $23.2 and then $136.3 has been met with skepticism within the crypto community. Related Reading: XRP Sees 80% Spike In Major Metric, Why This Matters For Price Appreciation However, the analyst points to momentum indicators at the bottom of the price chart that support his bullish outlook. He showed that in 2017, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) hit oversold levels just before the price surged dramatically. A similar pattern is appearing in the current market, reinforcing his belief that the next 2 to 3 months could be parabolic. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Emerges As A Hedge Amid Rising Global Geopolitical Tensions",
    "body": "As global geopolitical tensions intensify from trade fragmentation and sanctions to regional conflicts and currency weaponization, Bitcoin is increasingly emerging as a hedge outside the reach of politics. In an environment where traditional financial systems are shaped by state power and cross-border capital controls, BTC’s decentralized design is drawing renewed attention as a form of monetary insurance in an increasingly unstable world. Bitcoin’s Performance During Periods Of Instability The geopolitical tension may boost Bitcoin. Walter Bloomberg has noted on X that BTC’s recent rebound suggests rising geopolitical tensions are increasingly pushing investors toward cryptocurrencies. Walter made reference to 21Shares strategist Matt Mena’s statement, who stated that BTC is gaining recognition as a neutral reserve asset, alongside traditional safe havens such as gold and silver. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply Is Being Absorbed By Powerful Financial Players — What This Means After falling more than 6% last year, BTC has historically avoided back-to-back annual declines, supporting the case for gains this year. BTC was last down 0.3% at $93,740, after reaching a seven-week high of $94,725 on Monday, underscoring its resilience amid heightened global uncertainty. Considering most of the world is ecstatic with 8% annual returns, an analyst known as Juicy pointed out that the idea of doubling your money in one or two years is already an exceptional outcome for most average people. The hard truth is that most people will never hold their BTC long enough before they cash out 3 to 5 times their money, especially when BTC is down 50% in a bear market, because most people are emotionally attached to their money. Generational wealth with BTC is made by holding through multiple 50% bear market drawdowns across decades. The expert stated that his strategy is never to fully sell BTC, but to sell small portions at basic milestones like $250,000, $500,000, and $1 million, or even $10 million, while the main stack will not be sold. Extreme Supply And The Shift In Spot Momentum A trader known as DD highlighted that BTC traded directly into extreme supply just below Monday’s high and was aggressively rejected from there. This move was followed by a sharp push lower and was driven by heavy spot selling, confirming that this area remains a significant supply zone rather than a breakout point. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks A Year-Long Bear Market If This Happens: On-Chain Data DD recalled the weak weekly low, a level that has now been cleared. The market is now in a phase where the response matters more than a continuation. If the price begins to form local accumulation inside demand, that would present an opportunity to look for long exposure. On the other hand, if BTC bounces back into supply and shows clear signs of weakness, then the short setup will also remain valid. Structurally, losing the $91,000 level will open the door towards the weak monthly low around $87,800, which stands out as the next downside level.

    "title": "XRP Mirrors Gold’s Trajectory: What A Similar ATH Rally Would Mean",
    "body": "After enduring weeks of capitulation, sustained price declines, and overall market weakness last year, XRP is showing signs of a recovery. The cryptocurrency has rebounded above the $2.2 level after beginning the new year at a low of above $1.90. According to a crypto expert, XRP’s long-term outlook remains significantly bullish. He compares XRP’s projected trajectory to gold’s price movement, predicting a similar historic all-time high rally. XRP Tracks Gold’s Historic Run Market analyst ‘Steph is Crypto’ has stated that XRP is showing a rare chart setup that closely mirrors gold’s macro move between 2023 and 2025. In his analysis shared on X, the crypto expert explained that after a prolonged corrective phase, XRP has completed a clean Wave 4 structure, formed a Falling Wedge, and is now breaking out in a way that reflects early trend expansion behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Parabola: What’s Different Between The Last Bull Cycle And This One? The analyst shared a parallel chart that illustrated gold’s price action over the years on one side and XRP’s movement and future trajectory on the other. Over the two-day timeframe, XRP has completed an impulsive Wave 1-3, followed by a downward-sloping corrective channel that slopes into Wave 4, ending with a compression typical of a Falling Wedge. Steph is Crypto directly compares this formation and price movement to gold, which went through an almost identical structure earlier between 2022 and 2023. Following this corrective pattern, gold broke out decisively, entering a strong expansion phase that carried the price to new ATHs over the past months. The breakout also led to a sustained rally with minimal pullbacks and consolidation for almost two years. Based on gold’s explosive historic performance, Steph is Crypto has projected that XRP could replicate a similar trajectory in 2026. The XRP chart shows price stabilizing above the Falling Wedge breakout area near the mid-$2 range. From there, the projected path suggests a rapid expansion phase that mirrors gold’s post-breakout trajectory. If XRP replicates this historic run, it implies a new all-time high cycle, with the price potentially skyrocketing toward $37 before the end of 2026 or the beginning of 2027. The visual projection line on the chart shows that XRP could also experience a similar steady price expansion phase with minimal pullbacks along the way. Analyst Says XRP Could Outperform Bitcoin Soon Crypto analyst Matt Hughes has shared a new analysis of the XRP/BTC chart, pointing to a potential shift in long-term price performance. He believes that XRP is gearing up to outperform Bitcoin this year, based on a rate technical signal that just emerged on the trading pair’s chart. Related Reading: Popular Crypto Founder Dumps Millions In Ethereum, Here’s What He’s Buying According to Hughes, an incredibly bullish setup that has not appeared in years is developing on the XRP/BTC chart. He stated that price is about to break above the monthly Ichimoku Cloud for the first time since 2018, when XRP exploded to its current ATH of $3.84. Notably, a successful move above this cloud would signal a deep structural change in the cryptocurrency’s trend, potentially leading to significant relative gains this year.

    "title": "Strategist Reveals What Will Drive XRP Price To $100 Per Coin",
    "body": "XRP has opened the year on a firm footing, reversing the bearish momentum that carried it through the closing weeks of last year. Interestingly, one strategist is already pushing the conversation far beyond near-term targets. In a recent post on the social media platform X, BarriC outlined a psychological roadmap that explains how XRP could eventually trade at $100 per coin. This roadmap is built around how investor attitudes start to change as XRP reaches different price levels, which will gradually turn disbelief into C and urgency. Complacency At $2 To Quiet Regret Above $10 BarriC’s model starts with what he described as a dangerous sense of comfort at the lower end of XRP’s price range. Around $2 per XRP, most people assume they will always have access to cheap tokens, which removes any urgency to act. This attitude is evident in XRP’s current price action, with the cryptocurrency trading around $2.25 and slowly grinding higher. Related Reading: Here’s What Ripple Haters Get Wrong And Why XRP Is Set To Explode BarriC projected that even as the XRP price moves back toward $3, a successful reclaim of that level will still fail to generate excitement, because XRP is still seen as ordinary and easy to obtain. That same mindset, according to the strategist, will carry through to $5, where skepticism will start to take over. At that stage, critics begin questioning why XRP is only at $5 if it is truly expected to play a meaningful role in the future of global finance. However, BarriC believes the psychology will start to change once XRP pushes into double-digit territory, although not yet fully. Even if XRP is trading in the $10 to $20 range, most investors will not suddenly rush in but are still more likely to feel a subtle sense of regret mixed with resignation. This is where many convince themselves that XRP has likely reached its peak and that they have already missed the opportunity. BarriC describes this phase as one where people comfort themselves with the idea that at least it wasn’t a move to $100. Why $100 Becomes The Emotional Breaking Point According to BarriC, the fear of missing out is what will ultimately push the price of XRP into triple-digit territory. In his view, once XRP reaches $100, the disbelief will collapse and will be replaced by frustration and urgency, especially among investors who had long accepted the idea that such prices were impossible. Related Reading: XRP Price At $100 Is A liquidity Event Number, What This Means However, that will force latecomers to chase XRP at prices up to fifty times higher than its current price of $2. He extended this logic further by explaining that above $100, buying pressure would no longer be based on excitement alone. At $1,000 per XRP, the motivation will turn into desperation. His most extreme projection is a $10,000 XRP. This is a point of resignation, where investors fully grasp how severely they underestimated XRP’s long-term importance and the scale of the opportunity they once dismissed.

    "title": "SUI Isn’t Done Yet: Weekly Accumulation Holds As Buyers Reload Below",
    "body": "SUI continues to show resilience on the weekly chart, holding firm within a key accumulation zone even after a sharp correction from its highs. Buyers are once again stepping in at lower levels, suggesting reloading rather than distribution, as market structure hints that smart money may still be positioning for a broader upside move. Weekly Structure Holds After Deep 2024 Reset According to Crypto Patel, SUI continues to hold a high-timeframe accumulation zone on the weekly chart following a deep correction from its 2024 highs. The broader market structure points toward a re-accumulation phase, with signs that smart money participation is gradually returning after a sell-off. Related Reading: Analysts Turn Bullish on SUI as Token Extends Gains Amid Renewed Institutional Interest From a technical perspective, several key conditions are aligning. Liquidity has already been swept at the lows, while a strong weekly bullish order block between $1.50 and $1.30 remains intact. A Fair Value Gap (FVG) overlapping with this demand zone further strengthens the case for sustained buyer interest in SUI at these levels. Price action has already responded positively, delivering an approximately 45% bounce from the highlighted entry region. Furthermore, the rising channel structure remains unbroken, and the High-timeframe bias is now slowly tilting bullish as structure stabilizes. Crypto Patel maintains upside targets at $5, $10, and $20. As long as SUI/USDT stays above the $1.20 level, the macro bullish thesis remains valid, which acts as the key line separating continuation from failure. The setup is described as patience-driven, offering attractive risk-to-reward conditions for spot and swing traders willing to let the weekly structure play out. A weekly close below $1.20 would invalidate the bullish outlook, while continued defense of that level keeps the accumulation narrative firmly in play. SUI Remains Locked Within Its Established Structure In an earlier update, CryptoELlTES highlighted that SUI remains confined within the same broader market structure, with price continuing to respect its established range. This behavior suggests that the market has not yet committed to a new directional move, keeping both continuation and rejection scenarios in play. Related Reading: SUI Climbs Into High-Risk Territory As Wave 4 Nears Its Exhaustion Point The rising base has now been tested and defended multiple times, and once again, buyers stepped in aggressively from the lower trendline. Even so, the upper trendline remains intact, and that resistance is the real hurdle standing in the way of a confirmed bullish expansion. A decisive and clean break above that upper boundary would shift the overall tone, signaling stronger conviction and opening the door for sustained upside. However, if price fails at that level, the move risks being classified as just another relief bounce within the range, leaving the market stuck in consolidation and the larger direction still undecided.

    "body": "Investors are expecting Solana (SOL) to gain momentum in 2026, driven by rising on-chain activity, expanding DeFi participation, and increasing institutional exposure through exchange-traded funds. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Bring The Heat: $1.2 Billion Flows In First 48 Hours—Analyst While SOL trades at $139, below its all-time high, recent data suggests that the network’s fundamentals are strengthening alongside a gradual price recovery. Together, these trends are shaping a clearer narrative around how Solana’s valuation could be supported beyond short-term market moves. SOL's price trends sideways on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Network Activity and DeFi Metrics Show Sustained Growth On-chain usage has picked up notably since the start of the year. Active addresses on Solana rose from around 3.38 million to 3.78 million in early January, indicating broader participation across transfers, trading, and application usage. This increase in activity has coincided with a steady rise in decentralized finance metrics. The TVL across Solana-based protocols increased from approximately $8 billion to just over $9 billion, reflecting higher capital commitments to lending, liquidity provision, and yield-focused strategies. These gains align with longer-term data from Solana’s 2025 network review, which showed that daily active wallets averaged 3.2 million and non-vote transactions reached a record 33 billion over the year. Decentralized exchange activity also remained a key contributor. The annual DEX volume reached $1.5 trillion in 2025, up 57% year-over-year, with SOL-stablecoin trading volume exceeding $780 billion. Raydium led DEX platforms in terms of volume, while several others surpassed the $10 billion threshold. Application Revenue and Ecosystem Expansion Revenue generation across the Solana ecosystem continues to scale. Applications built on the network generated $2.39 billion in revenue in 2025, a 46% increase from the prior year. Seven applications surpassed $100 million in annual revenue, while smaller projects collectively contributed more than $500 million. The network itself reported $1.4 billion in revenue, reflecting a sharp rise in economic activity tied to usage rather than speculation alone. Beyond DeFi, Solana also saw growth in stablecoin transfers, tokenized equities, and Bitcoin-related activity. Stablecoin supply more than doubled to $14.8 billion, while transfers reached $11.7 trillion, pointing to increased settlement and payment use cases. Solana ETF Inflows and Price Levels in Focus Institutional participation has become more visible through Solana-focused ETFs. Assets under management across these products recently crossed $1.02 billion, with Bitwise’s BSOL accounting for the majority share. Data shows cumulative inflows of nearly $800 million and steady trading volumes, suggesting ongoing demand for regulated exposure. In the spot market, SOL has rebounded from the $120 area to trade near $140, supported by rising volume and improving technical indicators. Related Reading: XRP Rally Reopens The $8–$12 Zone Debate, Says Will Taylor While resistance levels remain, the combination of ETF inflows, higher network usage, and expanding revenue streams is reinforcing the case for higher valuations if broader market conditions remain supportive.

The pair could continue to move down if it settles below $2.150. XRP Price Trims Gains XRP price failed to continue higher above $2.35 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below $2.320 and $2.250 to enter a short-term bearish zone. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2.245 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair even spiked below $2.150.

    "title": "Did Morgan Stanley Orchestrate Bitcoin October Crash? Analysts Draw Correlations",
    "body": "Morgan Stanley’s filing for a Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF), coupled with MSCI’s decision to retain digital asset companies in its index, has ignited a wave of speculation among analysts. Notably, analysts from Bull Theory have alleged that these events could be indicative of a larger-scale market manipulation. Bitcoin Market Manipulation? In a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the Bull Theory analysts drew attention to the timeline of events involving Bitcoin, arguing that the trajectory from its October crash to its subsequent recovery in January resembles an orchestrated setup supported by data. The first significant trigger occurred on 10 October, when MSCI — previously a division of Morgan Stanley — proposed removing Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs) from its global indexes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Accumulation Continues: Strategy Purchases 1,287 BTC Amid Rising Prices This decision would affect firms like Strategy and Metaplanet, which hold substantial Bitcoin assets on their balance sheets. The implications were profound, given that MSCI’s indexes guide trillions of dollars in passive investments. If these companies were removed, institutional investors, including pension funds and ETFs, would be compelled to divest, leading to a substantial contraction in institutional exposure to Bitcoin and an immediate tightening of liquidity. Following that announcement, Bitcoin’s price plummeted by nearly $18,000, wiping out over $900 billion from the total crypto market cap. Morgan Stanley And The MSCI Shift The uncertainty continued with a consultation period that remained open until December 31. This three-month window of prolonged anxiety effectively froze investor demand for Bitcoin. Passive investors became wary, index-linked funds faced potential forced selling, and as a result, prices saw a stark decline—with Bitcoin dropping about 31% and altcoins suffering even more, marking the worst quarter for crypto markets since 2018. However, the tide began to shift on January 1, 2026, as Bitcoin experienced an unexpected surge, rising 8% in just five days. This $7,300 increase, from $87,500 to $94,800, left many analysts puzzled, especially since the relentless selling had seemingly halted abruptly. The analysts noted that this sudden upturn could imply that insiders might have had prior knowledge of forthcoming developments. Then, the narrative shifted dramatically on January 5 and 6. In a matter of 24 hours, Morgan Stanley unveiled its plans for spot Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and Solana ETFs. This was followed by MSCI announcing its decision not to proceed with the previously proposed exclusion of crypto-heavy companies from its indexes. A Calculated Move? The sequence of these events has led the analysts to present a narrative: MSCI initiated pressure by threatening index removals in October, leading to an extended period of uncertainty and suppressed prices. Related Reading: Solana Shatters Records: 2025 Annual Review Reveals New All-Time Highs In Key Metrics Once institutions had accumulated at lower prices, Morgan Stanley introduced its ETF, and MSCI subsequently removed the threat of exclusion, raising serious concerns about the possibility of coordinated efforts to manipulate market conditions. Bull Theory analysts assert that as the market now transitions back towards liquidity, the same entities that potentially orchestrated the prior downturn may be strategically positioned to profit from the rebound. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $91,550, having retraced 2% from the $95,000 2-month high reached at the beginning of the week. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",
