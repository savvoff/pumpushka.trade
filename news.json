    "title": "XRP Risks Double-Top Crash Toward $0.40, Peter Brandt Warns",
    "body": "Veteran chartist Peter Brandt is flagging what he calls a “potential double top” on XRP’s weekly chart, a classic reversal setup that, if confirmed, would argue for materially lower prices — even as other traders point to a washed-out weekly RSI reading that has historically aligned with prior bottom zones. Peter Brandt Flags XRP Double Top Pattern Brandt posted the chart to X on Dec. 17 and didn’t bother softening the message for XRP’s online faithful. “I know in advance that all you Riplosts $XRP will forever remind me of this post — ask me if I care,” he wrote, before adding: “This is a potential double top. Sure, it may fail, and I will deal with this if it does. But for now this has bearish implications. Love it or not — you need to deal with it.” The chart shows XRP-USDT on Binance in weekly bars, with two highs clustered around $3.40 and $3.66 and a clearly marked support shelf near $2.00. In classical chart terms, that $2 region functions as the neckline: lose it with follow-through, and the market is no longer in “pullback inside a range” territory — it’s in “failed structure” territory. Related Reading: XRP Price Falls To Critical Support Level, Is It Time To Panic? That distinction matters because double tops tend to be less about the second peak itself and more about what happens at the midpoint low between the two peaks. Brandt’s framing reflects that: the pattern is “potential” until either support holds and price reclaims prior levels, or the neckline breaks and the market accepts lower. In this case, Brandt’s chart is already showing XRP trading below the $2.00 line, with the most recent marker around $1.8859. That puts the focus squarely on whether the breakdown becomes a sustained weekly close-and-hold below support, or whether the move gets reversed quickly enough to treat it as a bear trap. Or Is The XRP Bottom In? Not everyone reading the same tape is leaning into the bearish conclusion. Trader Cryptollica posted a separate XRP/USD weekly chart (Bitstamp) on Dec. 15 highlighting the weekly RSI at roughly 33, accompanied by the comment: “$XRP WEEKLY RSI : 33 💥”. The chart highlights that, in the past five cases, similarly low readings in XRP’s weekly RSI have tended to occur around market bottoming zones. Brandt was receptive to the conditional logic — specifically, the idea that a failed double top can flip from bearish to bullish if the breakdown doesn’t stick. Responding, he wrote: “Yea, if this dbl top fails then this could become exciting. I agree. I am not championing a bear case — just showing charts for what they are.” Related Reading: Best XRP Buy Zone? Analyst Breaks Down The Key Levels That exchange captures the actual tension here. Momentum measures like RSI can identify stretched conditions and recurring historical zones, but they do not, on their own, invalidate a price-structure breakdown. Notably, Brandt did not provide a price target in his comment. But the chart he shared contains enough structure to infer the standard “textbook” projection many technicians would use. With peaks near $3.60 and a neckline near $2.00, the pattern height is about $1.60. The conventional measured move subtracts that height from the neckline after a break, implying a target in the neighborhood of $0.40 if the setup fully plays out. That is not a forecast, and it’s not a promise the market will cooperate — it’s simply the arithmetic implied by the pattern Brandt is pointing at. The more immediate question is whether XRP can reclaim the $2.00 area decisively enough to turn the breakdown into a failed move. If it can’t, the chart conversation shifts from “potential double top” to “confirmed break,” and the downside math stops being hypothetical in traders’ positioning models. At press time, XRP traded at $1.83. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Just Entered Extreme Oversold Levels And Analysts Predict New ATH Targets",
    "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) has entered an extreme oversold phase, with momentum indicators dropping to levels that historically signal market exhaustion and a trend reversal. Researchers tracking macro conditions and long-term price behavior say that the current drawdown reflects a reset in positioning, not the end of the bull market. Based on past recovery patterns, the analyst believes that Bitcoin could soon forge a path toward a new all-time high. Bitcoin Enters Extreme Oversold Territory Thomas Lee, Co-founder and Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of Fundstrat Capital, has flagged Bitcoin’s latest market condition as a key technical development. He pointed to data from Bittel Julien, head of macro research at Global Macro Investor, which highlights how deeply oversold Bitcoin has become within the current cycle and the cryptocurrency’s potential to reach a new ATH. Related Reading: Why This Week Could Be Transformational For The XRP Price In his post on X, Lee publicly commended Julien’s analysis, emphasizing that historically extreme oversold conditions in BTC have often been followed by meaningful bounces. Julien, who also shared his report on X this Wednesday, explained that his analysis responds to frequent requests for updates on a long-running market model that tracks Bitcoin’s behavior following major momentum breakdowns. According to him, the model examines BTC’s average price path after the Relative Strength Index (RSI) falls below 30, a level widely considered to indicate extreme oversold conditions. The analyst stated that Bitcoin’s recent price action has closely followed technical historical patterns, provided the broader bull market structure remains intact. The accompanying chart compares current Bitcoin price behavior with the average historical trajectory observed after the last five instances in which the cryptocurrency entered oversold territory. The point at which RSI declines below 30 is marked as “time zero.” In previous cycles, this moment typically followed a period of stabilization and a strong upward recovery over the following weeks and months. Based on historical averages, Julien sees a potential path toward new all-time highs if Bitcoin continues to track past recovery patterns. While the market researcher cautions that the chart is not perfect, he argues that it remains a useful analytical framework, particularly if the four-year cycle thesis continues to play out. BTC Cycle Could Extend Into 2026 As 4-Year Pattern Breaks Julien’s analysis also suggests that the current Bitcoin cycle could extend well into 2026 and challenge the relevance of the traditional four-year cycle thesis. According to the market researcher, the BTC cycle has never been driven by halving events, contrary to what the broader crypto community believes. Instead, he stated that the cycle is fueled by public debt refinancing, which was delayed by a year after COVID. Related Reading: Private Investment Firm Shares Why XRP Is Their Leading Investment He highlighted that Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is now officially broken due to an increase in the weighted average maturity of the debt term structure. He also noted that liquidity conditions and ongoing interest expense monetization, which far exceed GDP growth, support a prolonged cycle. Furthermore, Julien emphasized that Bitcoin’s price bases usually take time to form and often include periods of volatility before a significant upward move occurs. The market researcher explained that his analysis was not a signal of an immediate market decline but rather a framework that assumes the bull market is still firmly in place.

    "title": "Bitcoin Washout Points To $180,000 In 90 Days, GMI Says",
    "body": "Global Macro Investor (GMI) head of macro research Julien Bittel posted a bitcoin “oversold RSI” roadmap on X, arguing the market has tracked it closely and tying the setup to a broader view that the cycle could run into 2026—an outlook he says would render the traditional “four-year cycle” framework obsolete. “A lot of people have been asking for an update on this chart, so I’ll just leave this here for anyone who needs to see it,” Bittel wrote, sharing a chart of bitcoin’s average price path after RSI falls below 30, with the RSI breach marked as t=0. “This shows the average BTC trajectory following an oversold RSI reading, with RSI falling below 30 at t=0.” Can Bitcoin Skyrocket To $180,000 In Just 90 Days? Bittel said the overlay has matched the current tape. “So far, it’s been pretty bang on,” he wrote. The “average market path” line rises sharply over the weeks that follow. The chart shows a steep rally within 90 days after t=0, with the BTC price potentially surging near the $180,000 area. Related Reading: From Cycles To Continuity: Why Bitcoin’s 4-Year Pattern May Be Breaking Still, Bittel emphasized the chart is not meant to be a precision forecast. “No, it won’t be perfect,” he wrote, adding that “assuming the bull market isn’t already over, it’s a useful chart to keep in mind.” He also warned that the rebound process can be uneven: “bases can take time to form and usually come with plenty of chop before the bigger up-move kicks in.” He reiterated the conditional nature of the framework in blunt terms. “If you think the bull market is over and we are now facing twelve months of pain, this chart is not for you. Move along…” The bigger point, Bittel said, is that the familiar cycle narrative should not be taken for granted. “Unless you believe the 4-year cycle is still in play, which we don’t, this chart should hold up contextually over time,” he wrote. “As we’ve outlined many times, based on our work on the business cycle, the current path of financial conditions, and our expectations for overall liquidity, the balance of probabilities is that this cycle extends well into 2026.” In that scenario, he added, “the 4-year cycle is dead.” Bittel also challenged the common assumption that bitcoin’s rhythm is fundamentally “about the halving.” “Remember, the 4-year cycle was never about the halving, despite widespread belief that it is, but instead has always been driven by the public debt refinancing cycle,” he wrote, adding that post-COVID that dynamic “was pushed out by one year.” He now argues the cycle is “officially broken” because “the weighted average maturity of the debt term structure has increased.” He framed the macro backdrop in terms of debt-service pressure and liquidity response. “The bigger picture is that there is still a vast amount of interest expense that needs to be monetized, which has far exceeded GDP growth,” Bittel wrote. Reactions across crypto X ranged from enthusiastic to skeptical. The ₿itcoin Therapist replied: “$180,000 BTC in 90 days.” Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Death Cross’ Panic Returns: History Says It’s A Late Signal LondonCryptoClub (@LDNCryptoClub) said the chart “lines up with our thinking,” tying the narrative to what it called the Fed’s “not QE QE” dynamics and “liquidity games” between the Treasury and the central bank. The account still anticipated turbulence into year-end—“noise and chop into year end (which is negative liquidity)”—before “these fundamental drivers start to see BTC reconnect with the bull trend,” adding that “sentiment appears sufficiently bad for a BTC move higher to be the most hated trade to start 2026!” Others struck a more sardonic tone. “precision-grade hopium here,” wrote doug funnie (@cryptoklotz), while still sketching a conditional path forward: Still think as long as BTC survives (ie doesn’t close in the $70k’s and starts grinding down or accepting there), there’s a plausible path to new highs on the earlier side in 2026. Just need to survive the ‘transition zone’ of 4 year deterministic selloors exhausting, and then ending up in an awkward spot as the music keeps playing.” Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards was more critical of the statistical grounding, urging a broader test set: “Now re run this with 100 occurrences, not 5 during up only.” For traders, Bittel’s post effectively combines a tactical signal with a regime call: the RSI sub-30 template may map the rebound path, but only “assuming the bull market isn’t already over,” and only in a world where, as he put it, “the balance of probabilities” favors a cycle that “extends well into 2026.” At press time, BTC traded at $87,330.

    "title": "Why Is Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Down Today? BlackRock Deposits Spark Worry",
    "body": "The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are down today as the crypto market remains in a phase of extreme fear. This latest crash came amid BlackRock’s move, which sparked fear of a sell-off from the world’s largest asset manager. The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are down today following BlackRock’s transfer of 2,257 BTC and 74,973 ETH to Coinbase, indicating plans to offload these coins. Notably, the BTC and ETH ETFs recorded outflows on December 16, likely why the asset manager moved these coins to redeem shares for its IBIT and ETHA ETFs, which were sold that day. Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Decline Amid BlackRock’s Transfer These Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have continued to record mixed flows, which have partly contributed to declines in BTC and ETH prices. Notably, the Bitcoin price had surged to around $90,000 yesterday from an intraday low of around $87,000, before retracing below $87,000 about an hour later. This immediately sparked theories of manipulation, with some crypto pundits revealing that BlackRock wasn’t the only one selling. Related Reading: The Bearish Structure That Puts Bitcoin Price At $92,550, And Then $82,000 Crypto pundit Kruse claimed that Binance first bought nonstop for over 30 minutes to pump the price, then started dumping millions of BTC and ETH to liquidate longs. He noted that the Bitcoin price pumped about $3,300 in 30 minutes, with $106 million in shorts wiped out during that period. Following that, BTC printed another volatile hourly candle to the downside, which flushed out $52 million in longs. A similar price action had also played out for the Ethereum price. Kruse declared that this wasn’t random volatility but rather liquidity hunting. The pundit further warned that this is how leverage gets punished in crypto. He then reiterated that the volatile Bitcoin and Ethereum price actions weren’t random, indicating the market is being manipulated. Onchain Sleuth Tracer also accused Binance of being responsible for the Bitcoin and Ethereum price declines. He claimed that the crypto exchange pumped and dumped millions of BTC to liquidate traders, with $194 million in shorts and longs liquidated in one hour. BTC And ETH To Hit New All-Time Highs Next Year? Crypto asset manager Bitwise has predicted that the Bitcoin price will break the four-year cycle and set new all-time highs in 2026. The asset manager alluded to factors such as the Bitcoin halving and interest rate cycles as what will drive this rally for the flagship crypto. The firm also remarked that crypto booms and busts fueled by leverage are weaker than in past cycles. Related Reading: Ethereum 2-Year Trend Maps Out This Unique Crash Path To Bottom At $2,187 Bitwise also stated that institutions are likely to allocate more to Bitcoin ETFs, which is why they expect the Bitcoin price to reach new all-time highs next year. Furthermore, the firm noted that the pro-crypto regulatory shift will continue to allow companies to adopt crypto at a faster rate. The crypto asset manager also predicted that the Ethereum price could reach a new all-time high if the CLARITY Act passes. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Breakdown Or Bear Trap? BNB Loses Trendline But Flashes Strong Rebound Signals",
    "body": "BNB has slipped below its long-standing bullish trendline, raising fresh concerns about a deeper pullback. However, the selloff is unfolding right into a key support zone, where multiple technical signals hint that buyers may be preparing for a counter-move. With breakdown risk clashing against early rebound signs, BNB now sits at a pivotal moment that could define the next major move. Bullish Trendline Break Signals A Change In BNB Market Character According to crypto analyst Marcus Corvinus, BNB has just experienced a significant structural shift by losing its long-held bullish trendline. This technical break is a critical development that is rapidly changing the market mood from optimism to caution, as a primary support trendline has been invalidated. Related Reading: BNB Rebound Underway? Price Caught Within A Head And Shoulders Pattern The analyst noted that while the price had been respecting this upward trend for a considerable period, this decisive break indicates that buyers are finally losing control. Momentum is visibly cooling off, providing sellers with the necessary opening to press and take command of the short-term price action. Corvinus warned that if the price fails to reclaim the broken trendline, the path will likely open for a much deeper move to the downside. He emphasized that this current behavior appears to be a fundamental shift in market structure rather than just a typical small pullback, suggesting a more prolonged period of weakness. Thus, the market has now entered a caution zone, with the analyst noting that bears are knocking on the door of lower support levels. The next major reaction from the market will be the deciding factor in whether BNB can recover its uptrend or embark on a new, sustained bearish trajectory. Confluence Emerges At Key Support Zone In a recent update shared on X, analyst Batman revealed that BNB is currently carving out a highly attractive long setup. The asset is exhibiting a rare alignment of multiple technical indicators, suggesting that the current price level may serve as a powerful launchpad for the next leg up. Related Reading: Binance Coin (BNB) Extends Pullback as Meme-Coin Rug Pulls Sting BNB Chain This setup is rooted in a confluence of support levels. Specifically, BNB is resting within a strong bullish Fair Value Gap (FVG). This high-interest zone has seen a positive reaction from the market, as the price tapped the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. To further bolster the bullish conviction, the momentum oscillators have aligned with the price action. Batman pointed out that the Stochastic indicator has officially formed a bullish divergence followed by a golden cross. Significantly, this combination signals that selling exhaustion has been reached and that buyers may be regaining control, thereby paving the way for a potential sustained price recovery.

    "title": "Ripple Goes Institutional: What The Doppler Finance And SBI Partnership Means For XRP",
    "body": "Ripple’s push to advance XRP’s institutional relevance took a concrete step forward following a post published by Doppler Finance confirming its partnership with SBI Ripple Asia. The announcement marks a strategic shift from retail-driven narratives to regulated, institution-ready financial infrastructure on the XRP Ledger. The collaboration positions XRP as part of a framework centered on yield generation, compliant custody, and real-world financial integration. Doppler Finance And SBI Ripple Asia To Expand XRP’s Role Beyond Payments The partnership between Doppler Finance and SBI Ripple Asia represents a major evolution in XRP’s role in finance. While XRP has long been valued for fast, low-cost cross-border payments, it has lacked infrastructure for institutional investors to earn a regulated yield. This collaboration aims to change that by developing XRP-based yield products designed specifically for compliance-conscious institutions, creating a pathway for professional investors to use XRP as a productive financial asset. Related Reading: Dogecoin RSI Hits Levels That Have Triggered ATH Rallies Before Unlike experimental DeFi initiatives, this effort prioritizes regulated access, risk management, and compliance. SBI Ripple Asia—a joint venture between SBI Holdings and Ripple—anchors the project within an established financial ecosystem, lending credibility and operational rigor. Notably, this is the first time SBI Ripple Asia has partnered with an XRP Ledger-native protocol, signaling that the focus is on building durable, scalable financial infrastructure rather than marketing hype. Custody and security are central to making these yield products viable for institutional participants. SBI Digital Markets will provide segregated custody for all assets, meeting the strict standards required by asset managers, corporate treasuries, and funds. For traders and institutional users, this means they can access XRP-based yield opportunities without assuming self-custody responsibilities or exposure to smart-contract risks typical in retail DeFi. The framework transforms XRP from a token primarily used for payments into a balance-sheet-compatible asset that can generate regulated returns, opening new avenues for institutional adoption, portfolio diversification, and professional-grade risk management. Strategic Implications For XRP And Ripple In The Broader Market The partnership strengthens XRP’s role in real-world asset tokenization. Doppler Finance and SBI Ripple Asia plan to leverage the XRP Ledger to support regulated financial products tied to tangible value, positioning XRPL as infrastructure for institutional-grade applications beyond digital payments. This approach lays the groundwork for a structured rollout of XRP-based solutions. Related Reading: Why This Week Could Be Transformational For The XRP Price Formalized as a memorandum of understanding, the collaboration signals phased implementation rather than immediate launches. While timelines and yield structures remain undisclosed, the framework reflects clear strategic intent, creating conditions for XRP to expand its role in institutional finance. For XRP, the impact is structural. Combining yield generation, compliant custody, and real-world asset integration broadens its utility in capital markets and reinforces Ripple’s institutional narrative in Asia, where regulatory clarity typically precedes retail adoption. Ultimately, the Doppler Finance–SBI partnership redefines XRP’s value proposition. The asset moves from a transaction medium to becoming an integral part of institutional financial architecture. If executed as intended, XRP’s role in global finance could shift from speed-focused transactions to long-term, durable adoption. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "XRP Enters Historical Window That Has Previously Led To Triple-Digit Rallies",
    "body": "XRP’s weekly chart has entered a technical zone that has repeatedly acted as a turning point in recent years. A recent analysis shared on the social media platform X highlights a recurring relationship between XRP’s price behavior and its 50-week simple moving average, a long-term trend indicator closely watched by traders. Instead of focusing on XRP’s short-term volatility, which has been bearish, the analysis zeroes in on how extended periods below this moving average have coincided with the end of downside phases and the beginning of rally expansions. The 50-Week SMA And Why It Matters For XRP Cycles Technical analysis of XRP’s price action on the weekly candlestick chart, which was posted on the social media platform X by Steph, reveals a repeating cycle around the 50-week simple moving average (SMA). Related Reading: Here’s What To Expect With The XRP Price Trading Under $2 This analysis is interesting because the 50-week simple moving average functions as a structural divider between bearish compression and bullish continuation on higher timeframes. In XRP’s case, previous cycles show that brief dips below this level have not been as significant as sustained stretches beneath it. The XRP price chart below tracks how long XRP stayed below the 50-week SMA before a change in momentum. In the first instance in 2017, XRP spent roughly 10 weekly candles, equivalent to about 70 days, under the moving average before staging a sharp upside move. A similar pattern appeared in the 2021 cycle, where the duration was shorter, with 49 days, but still acted as an inflection point on the weekly chart. However, the most aggressive move highlighted on the chart came in the 2024 period, where XRP traded below the 50-week SMA for about 84 days before posting a much larger rebound of about +850%. XRP Sitting Inside The Same Window Once Again According to the analysis, XRP is currently approaching about seventy days below the 50-week SMA, placing it squarely within the same historical window observed in prior cycles. Particularly, Steph noted that XRP has now spent roughly 70 days below the 50-week SMA again, and this places an outlook on what to look for in the next price action. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts How Low The XRP Price Will Go Before Bouncing Resulting price action in the past has seen XRP rallying anywhere from 70% in 2021 to 850% in 2024. If XRP resolves to the upside again from the current structure, history suggests the initial signal would be a decisive weekly reclaim of the 50-week SMA, followed by continuation rather than an immediate rejection.

    "body": "Reports have circulated across social channels this week after a prominent XRP commentator warned critics that they may be underestimating the token’s long-term role in finance. Related Reading: 5,606 Bitcoin: Lightning Network Sets Fresh Capacity Record According to a post on X by user UnknowDLT, XRP’s place in global payment rails was “planned more than a decade ago,” and the token could one day become “the most valuable asset in the world,” a claim that has stirred both debate and disbelief. Community Voice Turns Loud Supporters in the XRP community have long argued that market prices miss bigger shifts. Based on reports from prominent community accounts, followers say short-term trading noise hides structural moves that could lift demand for XRP over many years. One commentator, X Finance Bull, has suggested that Ripple’s escrow — which holds 34.4 billion XRP — will act as locked liquidity for banking corridors and institutional use, not as stockpiled supply destined for retail dumps. The world is NOT ready for what is coming for XRP. It was planned more than a decade ago, it is going to be the most valuable asset in the world. There will be war for your XRP. People keep laughing at XRP. They will end up crying for life, the end will be tragic for them. — {x} (@unknowDLT) December 15, 2025 Regulatory Moves And Institutional Aims Ripple’s recent regulatory steps are central to the bullish case. Reports have disclosed that the company received conditional clearance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to pursue a national trust bank charter, and that it is seeking a Federal Reserve master account. Community analysts argue those developments, if fully realized, would move Ripple closer to mainstream financial plumbing and could change how markets view token supply and institutional demand. $XRP HOLDERS 🚨🚨🚨 If you’re thinking about selling your $XRP right now, THINK AGAIN! Remember this? Brad Garlinghouse confirmed the CLARITY Act is expected in early 2026. That’s not a maybe. That’s a countdown. And when it passes, Ripple will be forced to declare the fate of… https://t.co/s1E2KnarnM pic.twitter.com/C4xAcKDltR — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 15, 2025 Some supporters also point to a possible US Clarity Act as a legal milestone, with a timeline floated by some voices for passage in the first half of 2026. Tokenization And Big Numbers Analysts and company projections are being used to sketch wider potential. Ripple has suggested the tokenization market could grow to $19 trillion by 2033. Other commentators take that figure and run scenarios: if a slice of that activity used the XRP Ledger, price forecasts can balloon — with one cited bullish figure at $189 per XRP under high-adoption cases. Some community voices expect large-scale tokenization momentum to build between 2026 and 2027, which they say would favor high-throughput ledgers like XRP’s. Related Reading: Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund Numbers And Forecasts Not everyone shares the same optimism. Several firms mentioned by community members put much lower targets on XRP, with conservative models forecasting prices under $30 by 2030. Other professional models place $100 XRP well beyond the next decade. Traders and investors are left to weigh three competing threads: legal clarity, technical capacity, and whether escrowed holdings will be used for institutional flows rather than sold.

    "title": "Fading ETF Interest Puts Pressure on Dogecoin as Price Approaches Critical Cost-Basis Zone",
    "body": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is approaching a sensitive phase as weakening investor demand, stalled ETF inflows, and growing sell-side pressure converge near a key price area. Related Reading: XRP Risks Double-Top Crash Toward $0.40, Peter Brandt Warns Once driven largely by retail enthusiasm, the meme coin is now trading closer to levels where a significant share of holders last acquired their tokens, raising questions about downside risk if confidence continues to erode. At the same time, isolated whale accumulation and long-term cost-basis data suggest the market is approaching a zone that could define the next major move. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Dogecoin ETF Inflows Stall as Sentiment Softens One of the clearest shifts in Dogecoin’s recent market structure has been the loss of momentum in its exchange-traded funds. Data shows that the Grayscale and Bitwise DOGE ETFs have not recorded any inflows since December 11, with total inflows since launch standing at roughly $2 million. Combined assets under management are around $5.2 million, representing a negligible fraction of Dogecoin’s overall market capitalization. The muted response contrasts sharply with other altcoin ETFs, particularly XRP and Solana products, which have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in inflows. The lack of sustained interest has raised questions about the long-term viability of DOGE-focused funds, especially given their low revenue potential at current asset levels. More broadly, the ETF slowdown reflects a risk-averse environment, with the crypto Fear and Greed Index remaining in fear territory. On-Chain and Derivatives Data Point to Bearish Bias Beyond ETFs, on-chain metrics show declining participation from large holders. Wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE have reduced their balances by over 1 billion tokens since early December. Similarly, the proportion of DOGE supply in profit has slipped to near 50%, suggesting fewer holders are sitting on unrealized gains. Derivatives markets reinforce this cautious outlook. Short positions now account for more than half of open DOGE derivatives, while over $5 million in long positions were liquidated in a 24-hour period. Open interest has also declined, pointing to reduced speculative appetite rather than aggressive dip-buying. Price Near Key Support as $0.10 Comes Into Focus Technically, Dogecoin is trading near the $0.123–$0.126 range, an area that has repeatedly acted as support since April. The price remains below key moving averages, with momentum indicators such as MACD and RSI signaling continued downside pressure. A decisive break lower could expose the psychological $0.10 level. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Slide To $2,000 If December Closes Below This Level: Analyst Analysts have also projected deeper historical support near $0.074, where roughly 28 billion DOGE last changed hands. While a move to that level would require further deterioration in sentiment, current conditions suggest Dogecoin is approaching a cost-basis zone that could determine whether sellers remain in control or longer-term holders begin to step in.

Related Reading: XRP Risks Double-Top Crash Toward $0.40, Peter Brandt Warns The decision reflects a broader reassessment inside the central bank about how regulation should adapt to financial innovation, especially as digital assets continue to intersect with traditional banking infrastructure. Under the earlier framework, uninsured state-chartered banks were required to follow the same constraints as federally insured institutions in order to remain under Federal Reserve supervision. That approach effectively barred some crypto banks from accessing core payment systems or Federal Reserve membership. BTC's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview What the Policy Shift Changes for Banks The new guidance establishes a formal pathway for both insured and uninsured banks supervised by the Federal Reserve to pursue certain innovative activities, including those related to cryptocurrencies. Institutions will still be required to meet supervisory and risk-management standards, but they will no longer be automatically excluded based on their business models. For uninsured banks, the implications are significant. Access to Federal Reserve membership would allow direct settlement through central bank payment systems rather than reliance on intermediary banks. This idea could lower operational frictions for crypto custody, settlement, and related services, potentially expanding the role of banks in digital asset markets without changing existing safety and soundness expectations. Custodia Case Highlights Regulatory Tensions The policy reversal has renewed attention on Custodia Bank, a crypto-focused institution whose application for a Federal Reserve master account was denied in part due to the now-rescinded guidance. Custodia CEO Caitlin Long has argued that the 2023 policy effectively blocked lawful access to the Fed’s infrastructure and welcomed its withdrawal as a correction of past regulatory overreach. Not all policymakers agree. Federal Reserve Governor Michael Barr dissented from the decision, warning that loosening the framework could undermine a level competitive playing field and encourage regulatory arbitrage. Michael Barr’s position highlights the ongoing debate within regulatory circles over how to strike a balance between innovation and financial stability.r Broader Implications for Crypto Markets While the Fed’s move does not directly change how cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum trade, it may influence market structure over time. Easier access for banks could support deeper institutional participation, greater liquidity, and expanded custody and settlement options.

    "title": "Solana Value Proposition Extends Beyond Tech Into Economic Infrastructure",
    "body": "In the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, Solana has rapidly emerged as a platform not merely defined by its technical capabilities but by its broader implications for economic infrastructure. By enabling the class of decentralized applications, SOL is positioning itself as a high-performance blockchain and a foundational layer for the next-generation economic activity. Why Infrastructure That Enables Continuous Markets In an X post, crypto analyst Vibhu mentioned that Solana is no longer just a piece of financial technology, but a fully functioning economy. What exists on SOL today has gone beyond transactions and smart contracts. Related Reading: Solana Gains Institutional Momentum as New On-Chain Bond Deal and XRP Integration Build Hype According to the expert, there are dollars and native currencies, real-world assets, metals and rare minerals, energy market, information markets, manufacturing primitives, and global trade rails all operating in real-time on-chain. SOL also has politics, governance processes, divided factions, and ongoing debates about the leading network’s future. At this point, we are witnessing the birth of a country that lives entirely on the internet. Measured through economic output, SOL would rank around the 157th largest country in the world by GDP (Gross Domestic Product), comparable in size to nations such as Eswatini or Fiji. However, SOL is globally integrated by default, and from a forex and asset-flow perspective, it punches above its weight, integrating with the largest banks and financial institutions across the globe. Furthermore, SOL has withstood sustained network attacks from nation-state actors, defending itself with systems engineers instead of armies. Economically, SOL is already engaged in trade with countries like Bhutan, ranked 164, the Isle of Man, ranked 154, and even Kazakhstan, which ranks 49 in global economic standings. “Solana is a digital country, and I am proud to be a citizen,” Vibhu noted. Why Real-Time On-Chain UX Finally Works On Solana Solana continues to see key updates and integration that tend to bolster the network capabilities. Co-founder of TeamElevenX1 and Ambassador at Solflare, Kristofer_Sol, has highlighted that MagicBlock is quietly doing some of the most important work in the Solana ecosystem, pushing real-time SOL closer to true production scale. Related Reading: Solana Faces Critical Test Near $100 as Macro Pressure and Network Upgrades Collide At the center of this shift is the deep integration of compressed accounts into the Light Protocol inside Ephemeral Rollups, reducing rent costs by up to 200 times, while still functioning like a normal account for developers. The compression demo is already live, and real applications are actively using it today. Others like Rush Trade deliver faster trades, and Pixels achieve smooth, real-time pixel updates. Kristofer_Sol stated that this is what a scalable on-chain user experience actually looks like. With low-cost reduction and speed improvements happening without forcing developers to rewrite everything, MagicBlock is quietly removing the friction that has held back games, social apps, and consumer products on SOL.

    "title": "Bitcoin Faces Elevated Downside Risk: Loss Selling Takes Hold As STH SOPR Falls Below 1",
    "body": "Bitcoin has been under intense selling pressure in recent sessions, leaving market participants increasingly cautious about near-term direction. On Wednesday, BTC briefly surged from the $86,000 area toward $90,000, offering short-term investors a moment of relief after weeks of downside volatility. That rebound, however, proved short-lived. Price quickly retraced back to the $86,000 level, once again stalling bullish momentum and reinforcing the perception that sellers remain firmly in control. Related Reading: From Cycles To Continuity: Why Bitcoin’s 4-Year Pattern May Be Breaking This failed recovery attempt has weighed heavily on sentiment, particularly among short-term holders who entered positions at higher levels during the previous consolidation range. According to a report by Axel Adler, on-chain data reveals that this cohort has entered a clear stress regime. Bitcoin’s price has fallen below the average purchase price of short-term holders, a condition that historically increases the probability of reactive selling behavior. The stress is further reflected in the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR, 30-day), which has declined to 0.98. This reading indicates that short-term holders are, on average, realizing losses when they sell. Such environments often coincide with deteriorating confidence and heightened sensitivity to further downside moves. With BTC unable to hold recent relief rallies and short-term participants increasingly underwater, the market enters a fragile phase. The coming days will be critical in determining whether this pressure evolves into deeper capitulation or stabilizes into a base-building process. Short-Term Holders Under Stress as Loss-Taking Accelerates Adler explains that the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR 30D) is a critical gauge of short-term market stress, as it measures whether recent coin sales are occurring at a profit or a loss. Values above one indicate that short-term holders are selling profitably, while readings below one signal loss realization. Historically, sustained periods below one reflect deteriorating confidence and raise the risk of further downside, as loss-taking behavior can cascade into additional sell pressure. A continued decline in SOPR would likely intensify this dynamic and open the door to new local lows. By contrast, a meaningful recovery would require the metric to reclaim and hold above the one level, signaling that selling pressure is being absorbed and losses are no longer dominant. This stress is reinforced by the Short-Term Holders Positive vs Negative Sentiment chart. The indicator classifies holders based on whether they are in profit or at a loss. Over the past five weeks, sentiment has shifted decisively toward the orange and purple zones, representing negative positioning. The growing dominance of underwater holders increases the probability of panic-driven selling. Together, both charts deliver a consistent message: short-term participants are under pressure, and the current environment remains fragile until clear signs of relief emerge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Structure Turns Bearish As Structural Indicators Flip Negative Bitcoin Tests Critical Support as Bears Persist Bitcoin continues to trade under pressure, with the chart showing price consolidating around the $87,000 area after a sharp corrective move from the October highs near $125,000. The rejection from the upper range marked a clear shift in market structure, as BTC lost the 50-day and 100-day moving averages and failed to reclaim them on subsequent rebounds. The blue moving average has now turned downward, reinforcing the short- to medium-term bearish bias. Price is currently hovering just above the 200-day moving average, plotted in red, which sits near the $86,000–$88,000 zone. This level represents a critical area of long-term demand and structural support. Historically, sustained closes below the 200-day average tend to coincide with deeper corrective phases or prolonged consolidation. Related Reading: XRP Liquidity Dries Up: Futures Buy Volume On Binance Falls from $5.8B to $250M Volume dynamics add to the cautious outlook. Selling pressure expanded significantly during the breakdown in October and November, while recent rebound attempts have occurred on relatively muted volume. This suggests that short-covering and tactical buying, rather than strong spot demand, are driving price stabilization. Structurally, Bitcoin is forming lower highs since the peak, keeping the broader trend vulnerable. A recovery scenario would require BTC to reclaim the $95,000–$100,000 region and hold above the declining moving averages. Until then, the chart favors continued consolidation or further downside risk around the long-term support zone. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Bitcoin price attempted to start a fresh increase but failed at $89,500. BTC is now struggling below $86,500 and might continue to move down. Bitcoin started a fresh decline below the $86,500 zone. The price is trading below $86,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $87,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down if it settles below the $85,000 zone. Bitcoin Price Dips Again Bitcoin price attempted a fresh recovery wave above $88,000 and $88,500. BTC tested the $89,500 resistance zone and reacted to the downside. There was a sharp decline below $88,000. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $87,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The price even spiked below the $85,000 support.

A close above the $88,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $88,800 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $89,500 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $90,000 and $90,500. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $87,000 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $85,000 level. The first major support is near the $84,500 level. The next support is now near the $83,200 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $82,500 support in the near term.

    "title": "Flight To Metals? Gold And Silver Hit Records While Bitcoin Drops",
    "body": "Gold and silver hit fresh highs on Tuesday while Bitcoin slid back under $89,000, sending a clear message that some investors are favoring metal over riskier bets. Related Reading: Russia Rejects Crypto As Legal Tender, Finance Official Confirms According to Reuters and market data, gold traded above $4,330 an ounce and silver pushed past $66 an ounce in what market participants called a strong run for bullion. Reports have disclosed that silver’s rally has lifted local prices in India to about ₹2.06 lakh per kilogram. Metals Rally, Hit New Highs Silver’s advance has been dramatic. It is up roughly 120-130% year-to-date, a jump that outpaces gold by a wide margin. Traders point to a mix of stronger industrial demand from solar and electronics, tighter supplies, and flows into safe assets as reasons behind the move. Gold buyers have also been encouraged by signs that US inflation may cool and by shifting expectations for central bank policy, which tends to support non-yielding assets when real yields fall. JUST IN 🚨: Silver soars to $66 for the first time in history 📈🥳🫂 pic.twitter.com/YGCrB5VDPH — Barchart (@Barchart) December 17, 2025 Safe Haven Demand And Industrial Use Some investors are treating metals as a hedge. Others want exposure linked to real economy needs. Both forces are at work. Analysts say silver’s dual role — as an industrial metal and as a store of value — is amplifying moves. Energy prices and supply reports have added pressure on markets, and that has upped demand for physical metal in several trading hubs. Bitcoin Slips Under Key Level Bitcoin fell below $89,000 and was trading nearer to $88,450 in mid-session, giving back gains from earlier months. Based on reports and market feeds, BTC is about 7% lower year-to-date and roughly 30% below its October 2025 peak above $126,000. Some crypto funds recorded outflows recently, and several traders described market tone as risk-off, which has weighed on digital assets this week. Liquidity, ETF Flows And Sentiment ETF flows played a role. Where money leaves ETFs, prices can feel the impact quickly. Margin calls, profit taking after a volatile run, and investors moving to what they see as safer stores of value have all been cited by sources watching the tape. Technical levels near $84,000 to $85,000 are now being watched for support, while resistance sits close to $90,000 to $92,000. Related Reading: 5,606 Bitcoin: Lightning Network Sets Fresh Capacity Record Markets Eye Data And Policy Moves Economic reports and central bank signals are next on traders’ calendars. US inflation prints and comments from global central banks have been flagged as possible triggers for fresh moves in both metals and crypto. Investors also noted that equity weakness, especially in some large tech names, has nudged money toward hard assets and away from riskier positions. Several market strategists said that policy shifts overseas, including from the Bank of Japan, could further change global liquidity and investor choices.

    "title": "Bitcoin Mirrors Q1 2025 Playbook, Is It Headed To $70,000 Before Year’s End?",
    "body": "As the market volatility continues, Bitcoin (BTC) has failed to hold its short-lived momentum and reclaim a key resistance level for the second time this week. Some market watchers have affirmed that the flagship crypto may continue to have a disappointing end-of-year rally and potentially reach new lows before the pain is over. Related Reading: Did Crypto Investors Stop Believing In The Four-Year Cycle? Analyst Weighs In New Lows Before A 2026 Recovery? On Thursday, Bitcoin attempted to break past a crucial level after surging 2.9% from its daily opening. The cryptocurrency has been unable to reclaim $89,000-$90,000 area since the start-of-week correction, which sent the price to a two-week low of $85,145. Notably, the flagship crypto retested the crucial resistance area twice in the past 24 hours but has been rejected, falling back to the local lows. Market observer Ted Pillows highlighted that BTC has been holding above the $85,000 support zone despite the volatility, which could lead to another retest of the key $90,000-$92,000 zone if it holds. However, if price break below local support zone, Bitcoin would likely see a retest of the November lows, around the $80,000 mark. Ted also pointed out that the cryptocurrency may be mirroring its Q1 2025 price action, which suggests that a price drop below the recent lows could happen. Per the chart, BTC briefly bounced in March from its early 2025 correction before recording a lower low in the next few weeks. This was then followed by the Q2 and Q3 recovery rallies that propelled the price to its latest all-time high (ATH) of $126,000. Now, Bitcoin displays a similar performance, currently recovering from the initial corrective phase. If history repeats, the flagship crypto could see a 10%-15% drop to the $74,000-$76,000 area in the coming weeks before kicking off a rally toward new highs in 2026, the analyst suggested. Bitcoin To Continue With ‘No Direction’ Similarly, Ali Martinez affirmed that the cryptocurrency is at an inflection point and risks dropping up to 20% if the $87,000 support doesn’t hold. He explained that BTC is breaking out of a bear flag, which could target the $70,000 level if selling pressure spikes. Meanwhile, another analyst considers that “sentiment [is] flipping based on every last daily candle colour.” Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that Bitcoin has been trading within the $84,000-$93,500 for the past four weeks, “moving up and down in a choppy fashion, while trading in between these two larger levels.” To the trader, the next few weeks will continue to be “generally very choppy and lack direction” due to lower liquidity and trading volume during the holiday season. “I don’t think you’d be missing much if you log off and come back somewhere early January,” he added. Related Reading: XRP Price Must Defend This Level To Avoid 50% Breakdown, Analyst Warns On the contrary, analyst Crypto Jelle affirmed that despite the low-timeframe struggles, Bitcoin “still flat out refuses to drop lower, no matter how hard bears try.” He noted that price still sits “on a clear weekly support level” that has held since April, explaining that as long as this area holds, price can still reclaim the monthly opening, around the $90,300 area. As of this writing, BTC trades at $86,138 a 5.3% decline in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Crypto Payments Firm MoonPay Set For $5 Billion Valuation With NYSE Owner’s Backing",
    "body": "Crypto payment platform MoonPay is poised to receive a significant fundraising boost as recent reports suggest that Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is exploring an investment in the company. According to a Bloomberg report, which cited sources familiar with the discussions, MoonPay is close to finalizing this fundraising round and is targeting a valuation around $5 billion. New Regulatory Approval And Investment Talks Based in New York, MoonPay specializes in simplifying the trading of cryptocurrencies through various payment methods, including PayPal, Apple Pay, and Venmo. The platform also offers tools for users to send, receive, and manage stablecoins. Notably, MoonPay recently obtained a Limited Purpose Trust Charter from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), a significant regulatory approval that complements its existing BitLicense. Related Reading: Bitwise’s 2026 Crypto Forecast: Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Poised For New Record Highs This charter enables MoonPay to expand its custody and other crypto services within New York, placing the company in league with established players like Coinbase (COIN) and PayPal, which also operate under the state’s strict digital asset regulations. The momentum for MoonPay continues to build, particularly with news that Caroline Pham, the acting chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), plans to join the firm as its chief legal and administrative officer. CFTC Chair Caroline Pham to Join MoonPay Pham has been a notable figure in the regulatory landscape, having served on the CFTC’s board since April 2022 and becoming acting chair in January 2025. She announced her intention to return to the private sector once a permanent chair was confirmed, which is expected to happen this week with Mike Selig’s anticipated confirmation. Under Pham’s leadership, the CFTC expedited several initiatives focused on cryptocurrencies, including the allowance for spot crypto trading on futures exchanges and the launch of a digital assets pilot program permitting the use of assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in derivatives markets. Additionally, Pham implemented various operational changes within the CFTC, reportedly leading to nearly $50 million in annual savings by enhancing governance and accountability. Related Reading: Optimism Grows In Crypto Market Structure Bill After Wednesday’s Senate Banking Meeting Pham articulated that her agenda as acting chair concentrated on executing a range of presidential executive orders aimed at promoting regulatory clarity and efficiency across government agencies. Reflecting on her decision to join MoonPay, she emphasized the importance of people in her career choices, stating that meaningful connections guide her decisions. Her connection to MoonPay began through a dinner hosted by Christie’s Art + Tech in 2023, where she met MoonPay’s president, Keith Grossman. A conversation that started at the dinner evolved into a friendship and later professional discussions as Pham considered her options post-government. Grossman expressed confidence in Pham’s capabilities, stating, “MoonPay has really matured, and Caroline is the exact type of leader with the exact type of big bank and regulatory experience that’s needed for us to be able to move to the next level.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Solana (SOL) Support Shattered, Potential $100 Test Looms, Says Analyst",
    "body": "Solana (SOL) is currently one of the poorest performers among the top ten largest cryptocurrencies in the market, experiencing a sharp 13% decline over the past week. Bearish Patterns Emerge For Solana This downturn comes as the cryptocurrency has broken below the critical support level of $120, which had acted as a pivotal floor since the start of the month and previously prevented further drops. The situation appears even more dire for investors with bullish sentiments, as recent data from CoinGecko indicates that Solana has retraced nearly 60% from its all-time high of $293, reached back in January of this year. Year-to-date, the token has experienced a significant loss of 40%, which raises additional concerns among top analysts about its near-term stability. Related Reading: Optimism Grows In Crypto Market Structure Bill After Wednesday’s Senate Banking Meeting Experts are cautioning that unless conditions change, the Solana price may soon retest the $100 mark—an area not seen since April. Should this scenario materialize, it would imply an additional drop of approximately 15.9%. Some analysts, like market commentator EddieTradezz, have pointed to a bearish “head and shoulders” pattern formed in SOL’s daily chart, suggesting that Solana is on the brink of a substantial decline. He notes that it is now breaking through strong long-term resistance, with April’s lows around $95 potentially being a more realistic target than $100. Adding to the bearish sentiment, fellow expert ColdBloodShill has indicated that Solana may be heading toward a price point of $80, which would result in a drastic additional drop of 32%. However, as EddieTradezz mentioned, the possibility for recovery would largely depend on market-wide conditions and investor sentiment. Institutional Interest Grows As SOL ETFs See Major Inflows Despite the prevailing bearish indicators, there has been a noteworthy development on the institutional front. Recently approved Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US have seen impressive uptake, amassing $63.9 million in net inflows over the past week. This suggests that institutions are beginning to accumulate Solana, potentially viewing it as a long-term investment opportunity. However, this positive news has been overshadowed by heavy selling pressure in spot markets. Related Reading: Bitwise’s 2026 Crypto Forecast: Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Poised For New Record Highs Increased volatility has led to a rise in liquidations for leveraged positions, dampening Solana’s price reaction to the overall positive developments in institutional interest. Ultimately, Solana’s future remains uncertain. While institutional interest may offer some hope, the immediate outlook is clouded by increased selling pressure and the inability to regain capital in the broader market, which has recently dropped below the $2.90 trillion mark in total market capitalization.
