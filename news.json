    "body": "Bitcoin price started a consolidation phase below $92,000. BTC is holding the $89,500 support and might attempt to start a fresh increase. Bitcoin started a recovery wave above $90,000 and $90,500. The price is trading above $91,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $90,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it stays above the $90,000 zone. Bitcoin Price Stays In A Range Bitcoin price managed to stay above the $89,500 support and started a minor recovery wave . BTC was able to settle above $90,000 and $90,500. The bulls were able to push the price above $91,500, and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $93,770 swing high to the $89,225 low. However, the price seems to be facing a major hurdle near the $92,000 level. The 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $93,770 swing high to the $89,225 low is acting as a resistance. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $90,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin is now trading above $91,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . If the price remains stable above $90,500, it could attempt a fresh increase. Immediate resistance is near the $92,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $92,800 level. The next resistance could be $93,450. A close above the $93,450 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $94,000 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $94,500 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $95,000 and $95,500. Another Drop In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $92,000 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $91,000 level. The first major support is near the $90,650 level and the trend line. The next support is now near the $90,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $89,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $89,250, below which BTC might accelerate lower in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now near the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $91,000, followed by $90,650. Major Resistance Levels – $92,000 and $92,800.",

    "body": "Markets pulled $454 million from crypto exchange-traded products last week as investors stepped back amid rising bets that the US Federal Reserve may not cut rates soon. Related Reading: CZ Fuels Optimism As Binance Coin’s $1,000 Target Trends According to CoinShares data and market reports, the move erased much of the early-week gains that had pushed roughly $1.5 billion into the sector during the first two trading days. The shift was sharp and broad, though a few assets saw money flow in. Smart Money Flees Bitcoin While Some Altcoins Attract Cash Bitcoin-linked products bore the brunt of withdrawals, with about $405 million leaving Bitcoin ETPs. Ethereum funds were also hit, posting roughly $116 million in outflows. Multi-asset crypto products reported net redemptions near $21 million. Based on reports, these outflows came as recent inflation and jobs data made investors lower the odds of a March Fed rate cut, weakening appetite for risk assets that had been boosted by earlier optimism. Selective Inflows Show Pockets Of Interest But not all tokens were abandoned. XRP funds drew around $46 million in fresh money, while Solana products attracted about $33 million. Smaller tokens, including some newer layer-one projects, picked up modest flows as investors hunted for opportunities beyond the main leaders. Total assets under management across global crypto ETPs remained near $182 billion, a figure that shows scale despite the weekly redemptions. Regional Patterns Reveal US Outflows And Overseas Inflows According to regional flow data, US-linked crypto investment products saw roughly $569 million exit last week. That outflow contrasted with inflows in some European and North American markets: Germany attracted about $59 million, Canada added $25 million, and Switzerland drew roughly $21 million. The pattern suggests capital moved away from US vehicles and into other jurisdictions where investor appetite held up better. What Traders And Analysts Are Saying Based on reports from market analysts, the reversal came as traders reassessed the timing of monetary easing. With inflation readings remaining firmer than expected and the labor market showing resilience, market pricing shifted and risk assets were repriced. Some analysts warned that volatility could persist while others noted that pockets of demand for specific altcoins might support short-term rallies. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator According to observers, the outflows highlight how sensitive crypto fund flows are to macroeconomic signals. While $454 million is a meaningful weekly move, the sector’s overall AUM near $182 billion means a single week does not rewrite the market picture. Investors will likely watch upcoming economic releases and Fed communications closely; fund flows are expected to respond quickly to any sign that rate-cut hopes are returning or fading further.

    "title": "Coinbase Mulls Exiting Support For Crypto Market Structure Bill Ahead Of January 15 Deadline",
    "body": "As the January 15 markup of the crypto market structure bill—known as the CLARITY Act—draws closer, reports indicate that Coinbase (COIN) is reconsidering its support for the legislation. A Monday report from Bloomberg suggests this shift in position is contingent on whether the anticipated bill includes provisions beyond enhanced disclosure requirements tied to stablecoin rewards. High Stakes For Coinbase The CLARITY Act is expected to be marked up in at least one Senate committee this Thursday, and Coinbase’s potential withdrawal could have significant implications for the bill. A source familiar with Coinbase’s stance told Bloomberg that the exchange would re-evaluate its support if the legislation veers too far from its interests, particularly regarding stablecoin incentives. Some insiders suggest the bill might restrict the ability to provide rewards to regulated financial institutions, a move that aligns with the banking sector’s concerns about losing deposits to crypto platforms. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Its ‘Lower-Band Prison’ As Daily Trend Flips Coinbase currently holds applications for a national trust charter that could permit it to offer those kinds of rewards under regulatory rules. However, many crypto-native firms are pushing back against potential restrictions, arguing that such measures could disrupt competition in the market. The stakes for Coinbase are high, as rewards programs play a crucial role in its business model. The exchange allows users to earn 3.5% rewards on Circle’s USDC holdings. Should the market-structure bill include bans on these incentives, fewer users might choose to hold stablecoins on the platform. This could jeopardize an anticipated revenue stream projected at $1.3 billion in 2025, according to Bloomberg. Banking Vs. Crypto The GENIUS Act, passed into law in July of last year, prohibits stablecoin issuers from offering interest on token holdings, and does not prevent third-party partners like Coinbase from providing rewards tied to customer balances. The banking industry, however, argues that allowing exchanges to pay such rewards could negatively impact bank deposits and, consequently, community lending. As reported by Bitcoinist over the past month, the American Bankers Association (ABA) has voiced concerns that this situation could displace “billions” from local lending, allegedly harming small businesses and households. In contrast, Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase’s chief policy officer, has argued that maintaining rewards tied to stablecoins is crucial for preserving the dollar’s dominance, especially in light of China’s announcement to start offering interest on its digital yuan. Banking Lobby Fights Back A potential compromise being discussed would permit only licensed banking entities or financial institutions to provide rewards on stablecoin balances. Related Reading: Why The $2.9 Billion Bitcoin Whale Buy Could Spell Doom For The Market Recently, five crypto firms, including Ripple, Circle, and Paxos, received conditional approvals from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to become national trust banks, a move met with opposition from the banking lobby. If restrictions are indeed imposed, the report suggests that this could lead to creative workarounds as crypto firms seek alternative ways to reward customers.

    "body": "Monero (XMR) is leading the crypto market bounce by breaking out of a macro resistance level and breaching above the $600 barrier for the first time. A legendary trader has suggested that the cryptocurrency is mirroring silver’s historical breakout and could see a massive price discovery rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tops $92,000 As DOJ Subpoenas Escalate Trump-Powell Fight Monero Soars To New Highs On Monday, Monero outperformed the rest of the market, surging nearly 21% toward its new all-time high of $611.01. The privacy-focused cryptocurrency has been leading the start-of-year market rally, experiencing a 43% increase over the past seven days. XMR’s rally has been fueled by renewed interest in privacy tokens and redirected liquidity toward the project, which has driven its market capitalization to $10 billion for the first time. Amid this performance, veteran trader Peter Brandt drew a parallel between Monero and Silver’s long-term charts, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could be near a massive breakout. In an X post, Brandt compared Monero’s current rally to silver’s historical breakout, which led to a massive run toward new highs. Silver saw a multi-decade price setup in which its price accumulated below and retested a macro ascending resistance trendline. According to the chart, its price formed its long-term resistance during its 2011 peak, when it reached a slightly higher ATH of $49.83 before correcting. During its Q4 2025 rally, silver finally broke above this key level, nearly doubling its price toward its latest ATH of $86.23. Similarly, Monero has been forming its multi-year ascending trendline in the monthly timeframe since its 2017 high. In 2021, the cryptocurrency retested this area, also hitting a slightly higher ATH before retracing. Now, XMR has broken out of its ascending resistance and could see a similar path to silver’s recent breakout into price discovery, the post suggested. XMR to See 50% Breakout Or Breakdown Next? Market observer TraderSZ recently shared an optimistic outlook for Monero once it broke through its crucial resistance area and turned this level into support. To the trader, the cryptocurrency could reach three main price targets if momentum continues. Per the post, the initial breakout level could reach the $685 area, a more than 30% rally from the resistance level. Moreover, it could surge between 50% and 80% toward the $790 and $900 levels, like silver’s recent price discovery progression in the monthly chart. Analyst 0xMarioNawfal also highlighted XMR’s performance as “price continues to trend aggressively higher, breaking through previous resistance levels with strong momentum and minimal pullback.” To him, the structure remains bullish, with buyers stepping in and “no clear signs of distribution yet.” As a result, he forecasted potential volatility but added that as long as the price holds above recent breakout levels, the trend will remain intact. Related Reading: Solana Price Jumps, But Network Adoption Remains Weak Nonetheless, Ali Martinez posted a more concerning forecast for the cryptocurrency, suggesting that a significant correction may be around the corner. According to the chart, Monero has been forming a multi-year rising wedge pattern since 2017, with the price bouncing between the upper and lower boundaries. Based on this, XMR could likely fail to turn the macro resistance into support and begin a long-term 50% decline toward the $300 area, where the pattern’s lower boundary is currently located. As of this writing, Monero is trading at $597, a 47.5% increase in the monthly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin HODLer Selloff Ending? LTH Outflows Decline",
    "body": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin long-term holder outflows have been declining recently, a potential sign that selling pressure may be fading. Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Netflow Is Getting Less Negative In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the netflow associated with the Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs). The LTHs refer to BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins for a period longer than 155 days. Related Reading: Solana Price Jumps, But Network Adoption Remains Weak Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. As such, the LTHs with their long holding time are considered to include the resolute hands of the market. Though, while these HODLers tend to be patient, they have shown several phases of distribution during the last couple of years. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the monthly netflow of the Bitcoin LTHs. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin LTHs observed streaks of net outflows during both the bull rallies of 2024, suggesting that the diamond hands of the market participated in profit-taking. A short phase of distribution also appeared in mid-2025, indicating that the LTHs were doing yet another wave of profit realization. This selling was followed by a brief period of net inflows for the cohort, which was then followed by another wave of distribution in late 2025. This last phase of distribution is still ongoing, as the monthly netflow associated with the LTHs remains negative. The latest selloff has been a bit different from the last three, however, as it has occurred alongside bearish momentum in the cryptocurrency, not a price jump. While the distribution has continued, its intensity has been dropping lately as the netflow of the Bitcoin LTHs has been becoming less negative. As the analytics firm explains: Net outflows have rolled over from extreme levels, indicating that the market is progressively absorbing long-held supply and that a large portion of overhead supply may now be largely worked through. The decline in net outflows has come alongside a drop in the Realized Profit of the group, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. The Realized Profit here is an indicator that measures the total amount of profit that LTHs are realizing through their transactions. From the chart, it’s apparent that the profit-taking from the cohort was elevated earlier, but recently, the Realized Profit has dropped to a low level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Drop To $69,000 If Pennant Support Breaks, Analyst Warns The analytics firm noted: Such conditions are often associated with heightened uncertainty and tend to emerge during mid-bull market pauses or the early stages of deeper bear markets.

    "title": "Standard Chartered Sees Ethereum At $40,000 By 2030, Cuts 2026 Target",
    "body": "Standard Chartered has set a new long-range target of $40,000 for Ethereum (ETH) by end-2030, while cutting its end-2026 forecast sharply, arguing that Ethereum’s relative setup is improving even as Bitcoin-led weakness has weighed on absolute crypto price targets. In a research note, the bank’s digital assets analyst Geoff Kendrick framed 2026 as a potential inflection point for Ethereum versus bitcoin, despite revising down its medium-term ETH-USD path. “We think ETH’s prospects have improved. We therefore expect the cross to gradually return to its 2021 highs,” Kendrick wrote, pointing to a rebound in the ETH/BTC relationship as the core expression of his thesis. Standard Chartered Recasts Ethereum Outlook Standard Chartered now expects ether to end 2026 at $7,500, down from its prior $12,000 estimate, before rising to $15,000 in 2027 (cut from $18,000) and $22,000 in 2028 (cut from $25,000), with $30,000 penciled in for 2029 (raised from $25,000) and $40,000 by end-2030. Related Reading: This Ethereum Triangle Breakout Puts Price Above $24,000, Here’s The Path “I think 2026 will be the year of Ethereum, much like 2021 was,” Kendrick writes. The bank attributes the near-term markdown to Bitcoin’s drag on dollar-denominated crypto performance, with Kendrick noting that weaker BTC action has “weighed on the outlook for digital assets priced in dollars,” forcing lower absolute targets through 2028 even as Ethereum’s relative fundamentals strengthen. Kendrick highlighted a set of Ethereum-specific supports that, in his view, are more likely to show up in relative performance than in immediate spot-price upside. He pointed to continued accumulation by Bitmine Immersion Technologies, which the note described as the largest Ethereum-focused digital asset treasury company, at a time when ETF inflows have “temporarily stalled” and broader corporate treasury buying has cooled. Related Reading: Ethereum Long-Term Cost Basis Holds Firm: Structural Floor Forms Near $2.8K He also cited Ethereum’s centrality to stablecoins, tokenized real-world assets, and DeFi as structural demand drivers, and emphasized execution on plans to increase Ethereum layer-1 throughput by roughly 10x over the next two to three years. “Analysis shows that higher throughput translates into higher market cap,” Kendrick wrote. Regulation was flagged as a further potential tailwind. Kendrick pointed to the US CLARITY Act as a development that could be supportive for the sector and “particularly ETH” if it helps unlock another phase of DeFi activity. The US Senate is due to review the bill on Jan. 15 with possible passage in Q1. For traders, the framework implies that Standard Chartered’s highest-conviction expression is less about pinning an exact ETH-USD level in the next 12 months and more about whether Ethereum can reclaim relative ground versus bitcoin as throughput, stablecoin-heavy activity, and policy clarity compound into 2026 and beyond. At press time, ETH traded at $3,126. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins is confident that a long-awaited crypto market structure bill could find its way into US President Donald Trump’s office for signature before the end of the year. The SEC chief highlighted ongoing efforts during an interview with Fox Business to clarify rules around digital asset trading and said the bill could provide much-needed guidance to investors and trading platforms. Related Reading: Crypto Products Post $454M Weekly Outflows On Fed Jitters Atkins Expresses Confidence Atkins, who was confirmed by the Senate in April 2025 in a 52-44 vote, said tokenization and faster settlement systems are part of the next phase for US markets. He argued that a market structure law would give firms and investors clearer signals about which rules apply to trading in digital assets. Reports have disclosed that the chair sees the bill as fitting the administration’s push to make the US more competitive in crypto. This is a big week for crypto – Congress is on the cusp of upgrading our financial markets for the 21st century. I am wholly supportive of Congress providing clarity on the jurisdictional split between the SEC and the @CFTC. pic.twitter.com/NtDWRW85kL — Paul Atkins (@SECPaulSAtkins) January 12, 2026 Atkins discussed the regulatory forecast for crypto this year during an interview with Fox Business. Source: Paul Atkins Lawmakers’ Calendar And Odds Based on reports from financial analysts, the path to passage is not guaranteed. One market note put the chance of the bill clearing Congress in 2026 at roughly 50-60%, and warned that delays could push final action into 2027. Other analysts have suggested a longer road, saying implementation of final market structure rules might not be settled for years if political dynamics change. What Is Being Negotiated The draft measures under discussion aim to define which federal agency supervises different types of digital instruments, establish standards for trading venues that list tokens, and create clearer reporting rules for market participants. Reports have disclosed that committee markups are expected before any Senate floor vote, and those sessions will shape the bill’s final text. Industry Reaction, Market Talk The optimism expressed by Atkins has been welcomed by industry associations, as they see that clear guidance could lead to more institutional capital flowing into the onshore crypto trading space. On the other hand, the sentiment from many companies is that there is still a level of caution surrounding future regulations. Although regulators continue to show a level of agreement regarding overall regulation, the details of custody, custody provider(s), and oversight split between various regulatory agencies must be agreed upon by Congress before any definitive progress can be made. This back-and-forth between Congress and regulatory agencies has caused the markets to react in a pattern of quick positive movements followed by corresponding negative movements due to legislative inaction.

    "title": "Bitcoin Could Be Entering A Supercycle, Fidelity Warns",
    "body": "Fidelity Labs managing partner Parth Gargava says bitcoin may be transitioning away from its familiar, halving-linked four-year rhythm and into something closer to a “supercycle”, a regime that could keep prices elevated for longer and make drawdowns less severe, if structural demand continues to build. Speaking in Fidelity’s Jan. 9 crypto outlook for 2026 video, Gargava anchored the discussion in the cycle framework many market participants have used for years: peaks arriving roughly a year and a half after each halving. “Traditionally, what we have seen is Bitcoin has had this four-year cycle,” he said, adding that the pattern has been “highly correlated to Bitcoin’s halving events.” He pointed to the 2016 halving followed by a peak in December 2017 near $20,000, and the 2020 halving followed by another peak in 2021 about 18 months later. That history matters because it frames the debate around the most recent halving in April 2024. Gargava acknowledged the straightforward inference some investors make from prior cycles: “So maybe we are past that peak price.” But he positioned that view as only one side of the argument, highlighting a competing thesis that the market’s structure is evolving. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Selloff Ending? LTH Outflows Decline “On the other side, you’re also seeing a lot of arguments around how we might have entered into a supercycle as opposed to what we have seen in the past four years,” Gargava said. “And what a super cycle really means is you might have more prolonged highs, longer highs, and shallower dips.” Gargava credited Fidelity Digital Assets’ research team for outlining what he called the “super cycle mechanism,” and suggested an analogy to the commodities market in the 2000s. The key point was not that bitcoin would mechanically copy commodities, but that a sustained, multi-year bid can alter how markets behave, extending expansions and compressing the depth of selloffs. JUST IN: $5 trillion Fidelity talks about how #Bitcoin might have entered a “supercycle” Bullish 🚀 pic.twitter.com/IUv3GVHwEW — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) January 12, 2026 Three Forces That Could Push Bitcoin Into A Supercycle He outlined three drivers he believes could underpin that kind of regime shift. First is “steady buy-in by institutions focused on ETFs,” which Gargava framed as persistent demand rather than episodic speculative bursts. In his telling, ETFs can function as a channel that keeps incremental capital flowing even when sentiment softens, potentially changing the market’s typical post-peak unwind. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tops $92,000 As DOJ Subpoenas Escalate Trump-Powell Fight Second is policy. Gargava pointed to “pro-crypto policies” in the US as a supportive backdrop, implying that a friendlier regulatory stance could reduce headline risk and encourage broader participation from investors and intermediaries that previously stayed on the sidelines. Third is market maturation and changing correlations. “We’re also seeing how the crypto market as a whole is maturing and deviating from the S&P 500 and precious metals,” he said. The implication is that bitcoin’s trading behavior may be becoming less captive to traditional risk-asset moves and the simple “digital gold” narrative, an evolution that could matter for positioning, hedging, and macro sensitivity. Notably, Gargava did not claim the four-year cycle is definitively broken. Instead, he presented a live question for 2026: whether bitcoin continues to follow a post-halving path that culminates in a familiar, sharp boom-and-bust pattern, or whether structural forces: ETF-driven institutional demand, a more supportive US policy tone, and a maturing market profile support a longer, steadier expansion with “shallower dips.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $92,182.

    "body": "XRP is trading at around $2.06 on January 13, 2026, leaving its price action a full step below the zone that capped its last rally that ended with a high of $3.65 in July 2025. However, predictions that point to XRP reclaiming that peak and then pushing into new highs above $3.8, have been on the front page of bank research notes and trader-led chart projections. Notably, various technical analyses have suggested that XRP is programmed to return back into the upper-$3s and into new price territories this year. Standard Chartered’s XRP Target Clears $3.8 XRP’s all-time high price now looks out of reach, especially considering the cryptocurrency is now struggling to leave $2 behind. At the time of writing, XRP has dropped by about 44% from its July 2025 peak of $3.65, but institutional buys from Spot XRP ETFs are still giving glimmers of hope. Related Reading: XRP Back At The Edge: Will Breaking $2 Barrier Rewrite Its History? One of the most recently notable institutional-style projections from XRP comes from Standard Chartered’s digital assets research, which lays out a multi-year path that sees XRP breaking well above the $3.8 threshold. According to analysts at the bank, XRP is slated to reach as high as $8 by the end of 2026, a level that comfortably eclipses the previous peak and implies roughly 300% upside from current levels if certain conditions hold. Interestingly, this outlook came from Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s Global Head of Digital Assets Research. The prediction was made based on an outlook of continued institutional adoption and strong inflows into XRP-based spot ETFs. Technical Outlooks As Ripple Heads Into A Consequential 2026 Recent technical commentary from multiple analysts has converged on a bullish bias for XRP. For instance, XRP analyst EGRAG CRYPTO pointed out a developing breakout retest structure on the monthly candlestick timeframe. According to the analyst, historical probabilities favor upside as long as XRP holds above the $1.60 to $1.40 range on higher timeframes, with long-term channel projections placing the XRP price as high as $22. For a shorter-term perspective, Crypto Feras described XRP’s recent break above $2 as a bullish reversal signal. His analysis points to $2.67 and $3.01 as the next resistance levels, areas that could open the path toward a full retest of the prior peak near $3.8 if cleared. Adding to this, ChartNerd noted that XRP’s long-term upside fractal structure is still valid despite the recent XRP price correction. Related Reading: Analyst Updates XRP Price Prediction: Why $16 Is Still On The Table These price projections are being viewed more favorably against the backdrop of Ripple’s momentum heading into the year. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently pointed to strong progress in 2025 with examples of major acquisitions of Ripple Prime and GTreasury and a growing global licensing footprint. Now that Ripple is positioning itself for what its leadership has described as a consequential 2026, the combination of technical outlooks and company fundamentals has strengthened the narrative that XRP could be approaching a move to new all-time highs.

    "title": "What’s Going On With Bitcoin And The Stock Market? Analyst Breaks It Down",
    "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) and the stock market have experienced sharp price swings and declines since 2025. Because of this volatility, a crypto analyst has warned that the market correction could intensify further in 2026. In a detailed analysis, he outlines a bearish scenario for Bitcoin, suggesting the flagship cryptocurrency could soon face another price crash amid persistent downward pressure in the broader stock market. Analyst Warns Of Major Bitcoin And Stock Market Plunge Market analyst Doctor Profit has raised concerns about the direction of the crypto and traditional markets, warning that both Bitcoin and stocks are currently in a severe bear market. In a technical breakdown on X this Monday, the expert highlighted three major bearish setups forming simultaneously in Bitcoin. Related Reading: Why The $2.9 Billion Bitcoin Whale Buy Could Spell Doom For The Market He highlighted a massive Bearish Divergence on the weekly and monthly charts, a clear bearish flag signaling a potential drop toward $70,000, and a possible Head and Shoulder pattern that could still play out. While he acknowledged that Bitcoin could still experience short-term price increases and briefly rise toward the $97,000-$107,000 range due to strong liquidity, he said that the ultimate target remains $70,000. Doctor Profit emphasized that Bitcoin’s potential decline to $70,000 could go two ways. It could either break out of the bearish flag to that downside target or complete the Head and Shoulders pattern before reaching $70,000. He stated that he will not add new short positions at current prices but plans to increase them aggressively from $115,000 to $125,000 if Bitcoin moves into the $97,000 to $107,000 range. The analyst painted a similarly grim picture for the stock market. He said he was “ultra-bearish” on both Bitcoin and the financial system. He also noted that the banks are stressed and that forced liquidations in precious metals like Silver are creating ripples across the broader market. Additionally, Doctor Profit noted that insider activity shows clear signs of panic among investors, with record levels of selling since August 2025. Because of this, the analyst believes that the market is heading for a 2008-style crash. Consequently, he has concluded that the current market conditions are too extreme. On the bright side, Doctor Profit said that although he maintains short positions on stocks and Bitcoin, he remains bullish on Gold and Silver. He explained that any upside to the $97,000-$107,000 range will prompt him to increase his short exposure and roll spot profits for BTC from $85,000 into these positions. Crypto Markets Brace For Key US Decisions Toward the end of his analysis, Doctor Profit discussed upcoming events that could influence Bitcoin and the broader financial markets this week. He stated that the US CPI inflation forecast of 2.7% will be released this Tuesday. Other than this, the rest of the week is expected to have few market-moving events. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hits Crash Line, But This Time Is Not Random Doctor Profit has also highlighted January 15 as an important date because US lawmakers will vote on the CLARITY Act. He explained that if the bill passes, it will move closer to becoming law, setting clear rules and oversight for the crypto market. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "SUI Reclaims Key Support With Strength — Is $2.35 The Next Target?",
    "body": "SUI is starting to show signs of renewed strength after reclaiming a critical high-timeframe support zone. Following a sharp selloff, the price has stabilized above this level, suggesting the downside deviation may be complete. As long as this base continues to hold, momentum could gradually build, putting the $2.35 zone firmly in focus as the next upside test. SUI Reclaims Critical HTF Support After Sharp Selloff Crypto analyst Scient, in a post on X, revealed that SUI’s recent price action is unfolding exactly where it should after the sharp selloff. The market has pushed back above a key high-timeframe (HTF) support zone that previously acted as an important pivot area. This reclaim suggests the brief move below support was a deviation rather than a structural breakdown, with price now beginning to stabilize and form a base. Related Reading: SUI Isn’t Done Yet: Weekly Accumulation Holds As Buyers Reload Below From a structural perspective, the grey box highlighted on the chart represents a crucial demand and decision zone. Holding above this area keeps the bullish reclaim intact and signals that buyers remain in control at higher timeframes. However, a move back below this zone would invalidate the setup and shift focus back toward downside risk, making this area pivotal for the next move. As long as SUI continues to hold and build acceptance above this base, Scient expects a steady grind higher toward the next resistance area around $2.35. A clean push into that zone could open the door for further expansion if momentum improves. Currently, this structure is appearing across multiple assets, with many charts printing similar high-timeframe PO3 accumulation patterns. Within that broader context, SUI stands out for reclaiming key support decisively, positioning it as one of the more constructive setups in the market. SUI Leads With Early 4H Trend Break According to an update by Daan Crypto Trades, SUI was one of the first major assets to break above its 4-hour downtrend and push decisively out of the prevailing range, signaling clear relative strength. This early breakout placed SUI ahead of many peers and put it on watch as a potential leader if broader conditions improve. Related Reading: SUI Climbs Into High-Risk Territory As Wave 4 Nears Its Exhaustion Point Currently, the price is consolidating directly on top of the former resistance area, a zone that now serves as key support. Holding this level would suggest a reclaim of the range and increase the likelihood of upward continuation. At the same time, a loss of this area would risk a return to consolidation and weaken the bullish structure. Overall, SUI continues to stand out as one of the stronger-looking majors, but the next leg higher still needs confirmation through renewed momentum. Although SUI’s progress remains closely linked to Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which are still lacking a clear direction. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "XRP Is At An Unique Moment In History: Developer Calls End Of Suppression",
    "body": "An XRP Ledger ecosystem developer behind the meme coin DROP is drawing attention after predicting a sharp shift in XRP’s relative value versus bitcoin this year, framing it as the start of a new “price discovery” phase for the token. Bird, who posts under @Bird_XRPL, wrote on X yesterday that “5,000 XRP will be worth 1 Bitcoin in 2026,” then clarified his math with a specific price path in mind. “I said I think 5,000 XRP will be worth 1 Bitcoin,” he added. “For example 5,000 * $27 (XRP) = $135K (BTC).” While the post reads like a headline-grabbing forecast, the structure of Bird’s claim is a ratio trade: XRP outperforming BTC enough that 5,000 XRP could purchase one bitcoin. By anchoring the example to $27 XRP and a $135,000 BTC, Bird effectively argued that the market’s next leg higher could involve a meaningful repricing of XRP’s utility narrative rather than a simple beta move to bitcoin. Related Reading: Get Ready For An XRP Price Explosion Once This Happens; Analyst XRP Entering ‘Price Discovery’ Phase The call arrived alongside a series of posts linking XRP’s setup to broader risk-asset conditions and upcoming US macro catalysts. Bird argued that “above $2.70 $XRP opens the path to all time highs and beyond,” presenting that level as a technical inflection point. “Take a breath. Stay present. Remember this moment,” he wrote. “This is the end of a 7–8 year suppression and the beginning of true price discovery.” Bird’s longer thesis, posted on Jan. 11, focused less on short-term trading and more on a personal allocation framework that treats XRP as a long-duration hold. “XRP should be considered as part of your life saving plans,” he wrote, contrasting bank deposit yields with inflation drag. Related Reading: Ripple Builds ‘Next Amazon’ With XRP At The Center, Says Crypto CEO “Most people keep their money in banks earning around 4–6% a year and feel comfortable doing so, but they rarely factor in inflation. Over time, the buying power of the US dollar and the British pound for example has fallen so much, meaning your money often grows on paper while quietly losing value in the real world.” He then positioned XRP as an alternative store of value tied to expanding usage rather than fiat purchasing power. “That’s where XRP comes in. XRP has spent years suppressed by legal uncertainty, yet during that time the technology continued to mature. Now we have clarity, and we can clearly see what’s being built,” Bird wrote, pointing to “cross border payments, institutional adoption, stablecoins like RLUSD, and real world assets being tokenised on chain.” Bird framed the trade-off as custody and counterparty risk versus upside participation. “That’s why I personally treat XRP as a long term savings vehicle rather than a short term trade,” he wrote. “You can self custody it, store it on a cold wallet, and remove reliance on banks altogether.” Bird also tied the timing of his forecast to what he described as a convergence of market structure and policy headlines. “It’s a massive week for XRP,” he wrote, citing CPI and PPI as volatility events and highlighting that the US market structure bill is scheduled to drop on Thursday. “The charts are aligning. The macro is aligned. If this pushes in our favour and we clear $2.70+, an all time high can come very fast for XRP people!” At press time, XRP traded at $2.06.

    "title": "XRP Potential: Four Q1 2026 Triggers That Might Propel Price Beyond $8",
    "body": "As the cryptocurrency market enters the new year, optimism around XRP is growing, particularly following Standard Chartered’s positive outlook for the altcoin. As NewsBTC reported two weeks ago, the bank projects a significant surge for the token, forecasting a potential new all-time high of $8. Recently, market analyst Sam Daodu has identified four key catalysts that could drive XRP toward this major milestone, potentially in the first quarter of the year. What Could Drive Prices Higher? The first catalyst stems from the imminent passage of the CLARITY Act, the crypto market structure bill expected to be marked up on January 15. Daodu asserted that the clarity provided by this new bill could significantly enhance institutional participation in the XRP market. In addition, Ripple, the firm behind the altcoin, recently received conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to launch Ripple National Trust Bank, which will be a federally supervised trust institution. Related Reading: New Hope For Crypto: Senators Introduce Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act Moreover, seven spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are now trading in the US, boasting a combined assets under management (AUM) exceeding $2 billion and locking up 777 million XRP tokens. Another significant factor in XRP’s potential rise is the growth of the RLUSD stablecoin, which has achieved a market capitalization of $1.33 billion and ranks third among US-regulated stablecoins poised for compliance under the GENIUS Act. As banks begin deploying RLUSD across various payment corridors, activity on the XRP Ledger is expected to surge. Network fees paid in XRP create a direct link between the growth of stablecoins and a gradual reduction in XRP supply, turning utility into ongoing demand. Finally, the GENIUS Act, signed into law by President Trump in July 2025, established clear regulations for US stablecoins. This clarity extends to Europe, Asia, and emerging markets, allowing for smoother cross-border expansion. Bullish XRP Scenario Analyzing these factors, Daodu suggests a “bull case” scenario in which XRP could reach between $8 and $10. This depends heavily on sustained institutional demand and consistent inflows into exchange-traded funds. He noted in the report that if ETF inflows maintain the $300 to $500 million monthly rate observed in late 2025, it could lead to an additional 750 million to 1.25 billion XRP being locked by mid-year. Related Reading: Coinbase Mulls Exiting Support For Crypto Market Structure Bill Ahead Of January 15 Deadline Under these conditions, Daodu concluded that XRP has the potential to not only surpass the $8 threshold but to extend its gains into the $10 range as supply constraints exert greater influence on pricing. At the time of writing, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency on the market was trading at $2.13, marking a 3.7% increase on Tuesday. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Crypto pundit Bird has highlighted why this week could be a massive one for XRP. This comes as market investors keep an eye on key macro events such as the U.S. CPI and also the upcoming CLARITY Act markup. Why This Is A Massive Week For XRP In an X post, Bird stated that this is a massive week as the Russell 2000 has rallied to new all-time highs (ATHs). He explained that every previous time that this has happened, XRP has gone on to record a major run. The analyst also alluded to macro data dropping this week, which could also impact the XRP price. Related Reading: Analyst Outlines The Bull Case For XRP And Why Price Will Hit All-Time High Soon Bird noted that the CPI and PPI inflation data, which drops this week, always injects volatility into the crypto market. The crypto pundit also stated that the long-awaited markup of the market structure bill (CLARITY Act) is scheduled for this Thursday. This is significant because the legislation could provide legal clarity for XRP and other crypto assets. The pundit remarked that the charts and macro are aligning for XRP. He predicted that if these developments push the altcoin above $2.70, it could quickly rally to a new all-time high (ATH). Bird asserted that if this doesn’t happen, then the market is likely manipulated, as he believes that XRP and the broader crypto market should be recording significant gains right now. It is worth noting that XRP rallied to as high as $2.3 at the start of the year but has since lost most of those gains, though the altcoin is still up over 10% year-to-date (YTD). XRP could be one of the crypto assets that benefits most from the passage of the CLARITY Act, as it would boost Ripple’s operations, which could in turn drive more adoption for XRP. XRP Could Rally To $2.26 From Here Crypto analyst CasiTrades has predicted that XRP could rally to $2.26 from its current level. In an X post, she stated that she expects the altcoin to reach this level to complete a subwave 2 and that the next wave up is critical. The analyst warned that if the price action stays corrective, then there could be a sharp rejection that sends the altcoin into a subwave 3 down. XRP could break the .5 support in the process and target the $1.65 macro support. However, if XRP’s bounce has the strength to break above $2.41 and flip it into support, this could invalidate the scenario down to $1.65. CasiTrades remarked that this is the key decision in the market, even as market participants keep an eye on the macro fundamentals.

    "body": "According to reports, global crypto exchange trading volume jumped to over $79 trillion in 2025, driven largely by futures and perpetual contracts. That surge pushed derivatives to claim most of the market’s activity, while spot trading grew at a much slower pace. Related Reading: XRP Ledger May Get A Tokenized Gold Upgrade, Web3 Founder Reveals Spot Volume Climbs While Futures Explode Spot trading finished the year near $18.6 trillion, an increase of roughly 9% versus the prior year. But futures and perpetuals were the real story: they totaled close to $62 trillion, making up about 77% of combined exchange volume. That heavy tilt toward derivatives shifted where liquidity and daily turnover were concentrated. Exchanges At The Center Of Activity Binance stood out as the top contributor to both segments. Reports show Binance handled roughly $25.4 trillion in Bitcoin perpetual futures alone — about 42% of the top 10 platforms’ Bitcoin perpetual volume — and continued to hold large stablecoin balances relative to peers. Other major venues such as OKX, Bybit and Bitget formed a secondary tier for futures trading. 2025 crypto exchange activity in review. Spot volume reached $18.6T (+9% YoY) while perpetuals surged to $61.7T (+29%), with Binance dominating spot, BTC perps, liquidity, and reserves. Growth is derivative-led, and market power continues to concentrate at the top. pic.twitter.com/Om8udJJ9Qv — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 12, 2026 Derivatives Data Variations Not all trackers measure markets the same way. Some platforms reported even higher figures for derivatives in 2025 — CoinGlass, for example, tallied about $85.7 trillion in crypto derivatives volume for the year. Differences in counting methods, which products are included, and which venues are covered explain much of the gap between sources. Why Futures Dominated Trading Traders used futures to take positions, hedge exposures, and respond quickly to price moves. That activity raised daily turnover and boosted the headline totals. While spot trading reflects direct buying and selling of coins, futures multiply notional flow because a single contract can represent a much larger notional value than a spot trade. The concentration of trading on a handful of platforms has drawn attention from watchdogs in recent years. Regulators have warned that heavy reliance on a small set of exchanges could pose risks if those venues suffer outages or enforcement actions. The data for 2025 renewed those concerns because a large share of the new volume was funneled through the biggest operators.

Institutional interest, products tied to regulated markets, and changes to stablecoin rules are all possible factors that could reshape volumes next year. Analysts caution that headline totals will keep varying with methodology and which datasets are used. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",
