    "title": "Taiwan Plans BTC Reserve Review — A Bullish Rally Signal For Bitcoin Hyper",
    "body": "What to Know: Taiwan is auditing $BTC exposure and assessing a reserve strategy, with a formal report due by end-2025. This marks a credible institutional tailwind for Bitcoin. Sovereign-level interest strengthens the ‘digital gold’ case and can add marginal demand, supportive for $BTC price and $BTC-native infrastructure. Bitcoin Hyper targets speed and programmability for $BTC via an SVM-based Layer-2, aiming to unlock faster payments, DeFi, and dApps within Bitcoin’s ecosystem. $HYPER’s presale price is $0.013265; a potential high of $0.08625 in 2026 could mean a +550% ROI if devs successfully hit project milestones. Taiwan plans to put Bitcoin on its policy map. Lawmakers have pushed for a full audit of the government’s $BTC exposure and a formal study into adding Bitcoin to national reserves. Premier Cho Jung-tai pledged a detailed Taiwan reserve-strategy report by year-end 2025 . That’s not a casual nod. It’s a signal that $BTC is graduating from ‘risk asset’ to potential sovereign-grade reserve. The motivation is simple enough: diversify a reserve stack still dominated by USD and add a liquid, hard-capped asset with global settlement. This decision comes after Taiwanese legislator Ju Chun Ko had framed Bitcoin as a ‘digital gold’ hedge to USD concentration back in a May 9 session, signalling political cover for a serious allocation debate. Today, Taiwan’s FX hoard sits in the hundreds of billions, totalling $602.94B (of which 90% is USD), as per the CBC . So, even a small allocation would be material on the margin. A proper audit also sweeps up seized coins held by agencies following legal cases — inventory that could seed a pilot treasury program instead of being dumped at auction. This policy change could cause a domino effect. One credible government exploring $BTC reserves tightens the supply narrative and reinforces the ‘digital gold’ idea – particularly in an environment where ETFs have already absorbed a steady flow. If the report lands on schedule and the door opens to a modest allocation, the market gets another demand vector. Projects building real utility around Bitcoin typically benefit first. That’s the plan for Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a $BTC-centric Layer-2 aiming to turn store-of-value into a spend-and-build ecosystem. Bitcoin Hyper Wants to Turn Bitcoin Into a High-Throughput DeFi Ecosystem Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is building a Layer-2 that uses the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for fast execution while anchoring finality to Bitcoin’s base layer. In plain English, this means: cheap, low-latency transactions and smart-contract capability without altering Bitcoin’s consensus. Imagine Solana-style speed and programmability on top of Bitcoin’s security – a combination that’s been missing in $BTC-native ecosystems. To make this happen, the project’s playbook includes a canonical bridge for wrapping $BTC for DeFi use on the Hyper side chain, then releasing the L1 $BTC back to your wallet on exit. Once the live net is up, this setup makes it possible to onboard tooling for payments, DeFi, and dApps. Security is also a dev priority, especially for the project’s financing rounds. External checks from Coinsult and SpyWolf have reviewed the $HYPER token contract and flagged no backdoors or mint functions, a non-negotiable baseline to ensure token scarcity and fair trading. That doesn’t guarantee crypto success, of course. But good security does reduce avoidable smart-contract risk at the token layer. If Taiwan’s review lifts Bitcoin mindshare and on-chain activity, networks that make $BTC usable sit in the slipstream. That’s the lane $HYPER wants to own with its cheap payments, DeFi compatibility, and quick confirmations. See Bitcoin Hyper’s ecosystem plans. $HYPER Token’s Presale Is in Full Swing with $27M+ Raised Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the utility crypto for the Hyper network. Now in presale, $HYPER has crossed $27M, with plans to set aside 75% of its funds to support project development, marketing, and a long-term treasury. The token is priced at $0.013265 right now, though its fundamentals leave room for upside once liquidity and listings arrive in Q4 2025/Q1 2026. According to our $HYPER token forecast , the token has a potential high of $0.02595 in 2025 and $0.08625 in 2026 if listing and live mainnet milestones land as planned. From the current presale price, those levels imply about +96% and +550% respectively — not the moonshot hype you’d see on Crypto Twitter, but grounded in real value and fundamentals. Put simply, if utility ships and Bitcoin stays bid, this type of multiple isn’t fantasy. The market context is certainly on Hyper’s side. Taiwan’s review timeline runs through 2025, overlapping with Bitcoin Hyper’s roadmap windows. A favorable government report won’t flip a switch on day one, yet it improves the macro narrative for $BTC-aligned infrastructure exactly when $HYPER aims to turn on throughput. If a sliver of sovereign-level demand materializes, the liquidity tide can lift the $BTC-centric stack, extending to bridges, wallets, and L2s that make $BTC actually usable. That’s where a fast SVM execution layer tied to Bitcoin’s settlement could capture real volumes instead of pure speculation. Join Bitcoin Hyper and get 43% APY.

    "title": "Best Crypto to Buy as Franklin Templeton Extends Benji to $6T Canton Network",
    "body": "What to Know: Canton’s $6T processed assets and $280B daily repo volumes show tokenization has graduated from pilots to real transaction flow. Franklin Templeton extending Benji to Canton tightens the loop between regulated funds, collateral networks, and on-chain settlement. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) targets Bitcoin’s biggest gap – throughput – while Best Wallet Token ($BEST) leans into UX; Stellar ($XLM) anchors cross-border payments with deep listings. For presale exposure, $HYPER offers higher beta to Layer-2 demand; $BEST ties to wallet utility; $XLM provides listed liquidity. Franklin Templeton just plugged its Benji tokenization stack into the Canton Network, the institution-first blockchain linking collateral, settlement, and regulated markets. The move expands Benji’s reach from public networks into Canton’s private, permissioned rails where banks and trading firms already exchange tokenized assets. It’s a small line in a press release, but a big nudge toward mainstream on-chain finance. This matters, because Canton has scaled beyond pilot theater. Applications on the network are handling more than $6T in tokenized assets and north of $280B in daily U.S. Treasury repo transactions, a scale that signals real throughput rather than slideware. If tokenization is the sticky bridge between TradFi and crypto, Canton is where that bridge is getting traffic – and Benji now sits on it. For investors, this is a credibility signal. Regulated fund shares moving on a network that already processes institutional collateral give tokenized money funds and RWA collateral a clearer route into trading workflows. 💡 That’s a tailwind for projects positioned around Bitcoin scalability, self-custody user experience, and cross-border payments – three narratives with actual users and obvious product-market fit. Through that lens, three names stand out today as the best crypto to buy now. Read on as we delve into Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST), both in presale, plus Stellar ($XLM) on the listed side. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin Layer-2 With Throughput Ambitions When regulated funds go on-chain, low-latency settlement and high-capacity rails stop being optional. Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) pitch is simple: bring Solana-style speed to Bitcoin via a Layer-2 that batches, executes, and settles back to the Layer-1. The presale broke the $27M milestone today, suggesting there’s real appetite for a throughput-first Bitcoin Layer-2 rather than just another meme coin with orange branding. $HYPER is currently priced at $0.013265 with 43% staking APY. ➡️ Check out our step-by-step guide to buying $HYPER. In simple words, Hyper relies on tools like the Solana Virtual Machine and a canonical bridge to make the Bitcoin ecosystem more scalable, cheaper, and more performant, which would qualify it for mainstream adoption. If the Benji-to-Canton momentum translates into higher institutional tolerance for on-chain collateral, Layer-2s enabling $BTC-adjacent activity benefit first. The near-term math checks out. 💰 Our price prediction for $HYPER suggests a potential 2026 high near $0.08625 as core roadmap items – initial dApps, listings, and a DAO – ship. From today’s $0.013265 presale price, that’s roughly ~6.5x to the 2026 high if execution stays on track. These stats alone recommend $HYPER as one of the best crypto to buy today. This isn’t a free lunch; delivery risk is real and competition across Bitcoin Layer-2s is heating up. But the asymmetry suits presale math, and the story aligns with the market’s push toward on-chain collateral and instant settlement. 🚀 Don’t delay – buy your $HYPER today. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Utility-First Wallet Token With Presale Traction Canton’s growth underscores a simple truth: the next wave of users will need better UX for multi-chain portfolios, bridging, and payments. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) centers that need. It’s the native asset for the self-custody Best Wallet app ecosystem that folds in a DEX, cross-chain swaps, and a card product. The presale has reached the 17M raised, with the token currently priced at $0.025935. That’s not froth; that’s users voting for utility and distribution. The Best Wallet ecosystem offers non-custodial services and plans to ‘capture 40% of the crypto wallet market share by the end of 2026’. The roadmap details the exact strategy at work, which involves milestones like 60+ chain support, a fiat offramp, and the Best Card, to name a few. 💰 Our price prediction for $BEST sees a potential end-2025 range topping around $0.035215 and a 2026 potential high near $0.05106175 if the roadmap lands – wallet growth, card rollout, and deeper integrations. From the current presale price, that’s ~36%–90% upside across the two years, with compounding utility rather than pure narrative carrying the lift. Yes, execution and listings timing matter. Still, with tokenized funds and RWAs normalizing, a wallet that abstracts network sprawl while offering real-world spend hooks is exactly what many newcomers will need. ➡️ Our guide to buying $BEST will help you navigate the purchase process. But hurry – the presale ends in two weeks. 🚀 Buy $BEST today and stake it for 77% APY while you still can. 3. Stellar ($XLM) – Payments Rail With Exchange Liquidity Today Stellar ($XLM) remains one of the most proven options for compliant cross-border transfers and fiat on-/off-ramps, now supported by Soroban smart contracts to widen its developer surface. Recent figures show $XLM at $0.2921 with a market cap above $9.3B, and the asset is broadly listed, including on Binance and Coinbase – meaning price discovery and liquidity are not theoretical. In a world where tokenized fund shares and repo collateral settle on permissioned chains, there’s still a huge role for public infrastructure that lets fintechs, remittance players, and stablecoin issuers move value across borders. ⚙️ Stellar’s blend of speed, low fees, and established exchange coverage keeps it relevant as the tokenization stack grows above it. Holders also get a clean story: payments first, programmability now, and plenty of listings to trade the cycle. With $XLM above $0.29 at the time of writing and an all-time ROI north of 9,677%, this one seems to be a banger. 🚀 Buy $XLM on Binance and other leading platforms today. Recap: Franklin Templeton’s Canton integration is the headline, but the subtext is bigger: regulated liquidity is moving on-chain at industrial scale. That is the connective tissue behind $HYPER’s Layer-2 throughput pitch, $BEST’s UX-led approach to self-custody, and $XLM’s liquid payments rail. If the question is the best crypto to buy into this tokenized-finance backdrop, these three sit squarely in the narrative with distinct roles and risk profiles.

    "title": "Popular Crypto Trader Reveals Why Bitcoin Price Is Still Crashing",
    "body": "Bitcoin is down by 2.1% in the past 24 hours, and its latest decline has come at a moment when many traders expected the opposite. The US government shutdown is already in the process of winding down after weeks of uncertainty, yet the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum have continued to drift lower and are under pressure. The cryptocurrency market’s inability to rebound notably has led to active debate among traders on X. One of the most vocal views came from a popular trader known as The White Whale, whose remarks express a growing sense of frustration across the crypto community. The Shutdown Isn’t Really Over The White Whale argument is that the crypto market’s price action is yet to rebound because the government shutdown is not truly over. The analyst insinuates that the apparent resolution to the shutdown is far less reassuring than it looks. Related Reading: Adam Beck’s Bitcoin Realization: What Kind Of Money Is BTC? In his view, the government only approved short-term funding so that federal workers get paid through the holiday period, but this leaves the underlying issue unresolved. The temporary nature of the fix means the same uncertainty could come back in just a few weeks, which he believes is preventing markets from reacting positively. The discussion attracted instant responses, including a contrasting view from another commentator, Nara Sumas. Sumas dismissed the idea that the shutdown is the main factor behind price action, noting that markets barely reacted when the shutdown began. The point is that the macro crypto environment is already heavy with weak sentiment, and there is bad news about the markets every day. Therefore, the crypto market’s decline has more to do with those structural conditions than with government drama. Furthermore, the brief uptick earlier in the week was due to exuberance and not anything based on fundamentals. Despite the pushback, The White Whale doubled down on his stance. He maintained that markets do react to shutdowns, but not immediately. Therefore, the delayed downturn is a reaction after it became apparent to investors that the situation wasn’t going to be resolved quickly. What’s Next For The Crypto Market? The path ahead for the crypto market is tied to whether confidence can return after weeks of choppy price action and sentiment. The exchange between traders on X, like the one highlighted above, shows that many are weighing the impact of the temporary government funding deal against the deeper macro issues that have shaped this downturn.

Even though the shutdown is winding down, the uncertainty around what happens next is notable, especially for investors who rely on clear policy direction before taking on additional risk. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,900, down by 2% in the past 24 hours. At the same time, XRP is witnessing a resurgence in interest, as investors are now awaiting the possible launch of a US-based Spot XRP ETF this week.

    "title": "Kyrgyzstan’s Gold-Backed Stablecoin Could Be Shining New Light on Best Wallet Token",
    "body": "What to Know: USDKG changes the usual stablecoin model by backing a dollar peg with real gold from Kyrgyzstan’s reserves. If gold and commodity stablecoins grow, users will want wallets that handle many stablecoins without turning their portfolio into a spreadsheet headache. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) gives real perks, like lower fees, early presale access, and smooth cross-chain swaps. Stablecoin liquidity drives the market, and wallet-layer tokens can collect lasting value from routing, discovery, and spending features. Think of them as the toll booths of the crypto highways. Kyrgyzstan surprised the stablecoin world with $USDKG, a gold-backed dollar coin that comes with a $50M first mint. It’s a different style in a market where most issuers rely on T-bills and repo. This launch is not just a flashy headline. It shows Kyrgyzstan wants more freedom in cross-border trade in a world full of sanctions and red tape. It also pushes the idea that dollar-pegged coins do not always need US financial plumbing behind them. $USDKG is pegged 1:1 to the dollar . Simple. But the backing is the twist. Gold replaces the usual short-term US assets. If USDKG becomes useful for settlement in Central Asia and nearby regions, we could see other countries and commodity exporters try non-Treasury collateral, too. It won’t shake the US.bond market tomorrow, but it does widen the design space for stablecoins. Think of it as switching from a single spice kitchen to a full spice rack. This shift brings wallets into the picture. People don’t change stablecoins alone – they change the tools they use. A wallet that handles swaps, cuts fees, and helps you find new assets becomes the winner. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is built for this moment. It offers a retail-friendly, non-custodial setup where the token has real utility inside the app. If gold-backed and commodity-linked stablecoins pick up speed, users will want wallets that make juggling multiple coins painless. That’s where $BEST fits. The token supports an ecosystem made for cross-chain swaps, presale access, and smoother on-off-ramp flows. Why Best Wallet Token ($BEST) Stands Out in the New Stablecoin Era When collateral changes, user habits change too. Gold backing means nothing if you can’t hold USDKG next to USDT, USDC, and your favorite RWA tokens without stress. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) focuses exactly on removing that stress. The Best Wallet app is non-custodial and multi-chain. It uses Fireblocks MPC security, so you stay in control while avoiding the classic seed phrase panic moment (we’ve all had that nightmare). Inside the app, a DEX aggregator pulls liquidity across some 300 chains and 30 bridges. You rebalance your assets with one tap instead of spending a week crying over gas fees, failed approvals, and mystery errors. $BEST shapes the economics of the wallet. Hold it, and you pay fewer fees. Swaps can get better terms when the network is busy. You also get early access to new tokens through the Upcoming Tokens portal. In a future where gold coins, sovereign coins, and tokenized Treasuries sit side by side, this curation layer becomes useful. You find new assets while staying inside one interface that already holds your $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, and standard stablecoins. Add portfolio tools, multiple wallet support, and anti-fraud features, and you end up with an app built for fast moves between new stablecoin rails and the wider crypto market. If USDKG and similar coins create new trade routes, the wallets that lower switching costs will capture users. It’s a smart time to check out the $BEST presale. The $BEST Presale and Why Timing Helps Wallet Tokens Macro forces help this story. Stablecoins already hold huge piles of T-bills and dominate on-chain liquidity. If some capital shifts toward gold-backed or commodity-linked models, that could expand stablecoin use cases rather than shrink them. In that world, wallet-layer tokens can capture a steady flow of fees and loyalty. The $BEST presale just passed the $17M mark, and you can buy $BEST for just $0.025935. The setup is simple: give the token real perks inside the app and reward people who use it. That includes reduced fees, early allocations, and higher engagement through staking. As cross-chain swaps and launchpad tools grow, the token becomes something you feel in daily use, not just a number on a dashboard. Holders get cheaper transactions, exclusive early access to trusted new projects before they launch publically, and a voice in which chains and features appear next. Demand is not imagined. It grows from an app that already solves basic user problems. At the current presale price, future listings and feature rollouts matter mainly through fee savings and access. That is a healthier angle in a market where narratives move quickly and every little transaction cost adds up. If you think stablecoins will keep diversifying and retail users will keep chasing easier tools, Best Wallet Token is one of the best crypto presales to invest in.

    "body": "According to market watchers, US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs posted a $520 million inflow on Tuesday, a sharp change after a mild $1.15 million inflow the day before and a recent week that saw $1.22 billion in withdrawals. Related Reading: XRP Has Held Its Ground As Most Altcoins Fall, Market Observers Say That swing in flows is being watched closely because inflows into ETFs have in the past helped drive big price climbs. Right now Bitcoin trades around $104,000, and some analysts say a jump toward $160,000–$170,000 is possible if buying pressure keeps building. Diminishing Golden Curves Hint At Lower Peaks Based on reports from CryptoCon, a model called diminishing golden curves maps price bands using logarithmic regression. The model tracks how far Bitcoin moves above a “Golden Curve” growth path and labels those moves with deviation levels. The next target for #Bitcoin is between $160,000 and $170,000 🚀 pic.twitter.com/QAd3RdDS8q — Bitcoin Teddy (@Bitcoin_Teddy) November 12, 2025 Past cycle tops landed at +5 in November 2013, +4 in December 2017, and +3 in November 2021. CryptoCon’s projection now places the next top near the +2 band, which translates to a range between $160,000 and $170,000, with a possible swing toward $186,000. If that plays out, Bitcoin would climb about 70% from current levels near $104,000. Halving Rhythm Still In Play Reports show the chart also uses halving-based sine waves. Since the last halving occurred in April 2024, the model expects a market peak in late 2025, a timing that matches the rough 12–18 month pattern seen after previous halvings. That rhythm has been a simple guide for many traders. It is not a guarantee, but it helps explain why analysts are paying attention to late 2025 as a possible climax point. Stablecoin And Exchange Reserves Add Weight On-chain signals add more detail. The stablecoin supply ratio has fallen to levels that historically lined up with market lows, suggesting there is dry powder waiting on the sidelines. Data from Binance shows stablecoin reserves rising while Bitcoin reserves on the exchange fall — a mix often read as accumulation by long-term holders. CryptoQuant analyst Moreno says liquidity is increasing and volatility is low, which can make the risk-reward seem attractive to buyers. Related Reading: Dogecoin Alert! Price Could Explode Over 2,800%, Analyst Says Timing And Risks Remain Important Market conditions could change quickly, Especially with new economic data and the end of the US government shutdown. That kind of macro event can add volatility and shift flows. Models like the Diminishing Golden Curves are useful tools, yet they depend on history repeating in ways that might not hold if a major shock appears.

Related Reading: Ethereum Ready To Explode To $12,000 By January, Says Tom Lee The launch gives traditional investors direct exposure to XRP through regulated brokerage accounts, and analysts say this could be the spark that propels prices sharply higher in the coming weeks. XRP's price moving sideways on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview First Spot XRP ETF on Nasdaq Unlocks New Demand Nasdaq has certified the Canary Capital XRP ETF for trading under the ticker XRPC, making it the first fully spot-based XRP ETF in the U.S. The fund holds XRP directly and tracks the XRP-USD CCIXber Reference Rate Index, offering a simple, regulated way for institutions and retail investors to gain exposure without managing wallets or private keys. The ETF’s approval comes after the fund completed its Form 8-A filing with the SEC, clearing key regulatory hurdles. Other heavyweights, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, CoinShares, and 21Shares, also have XRP ETF applications in the pipeline, signaling a second wave of products that could further deepen liquidity and demand. On-chain data already shows shifting behavior ahead of the launch. Exchange inflows are down, suggesting holders are accumulating rather than selling, even as XRP trades around the $2.39–$2.50 zone and consolidates above support near $2.20–$2.40. Analysts See ‘Face-Melting’ XRP Price Rally as Technicals Coil Popular crypto analyst Egrag Crypto believes XRP is entering the final stages of a major consolidation that could lead to an explosive move within 4–6 weeks. Drawing on historical rallies in 2017 and 2021, he notes that XRP is once again forming a large symmetrical triangle, typically a “compression before expansion” structure. Using Fibonacci projections, Egrag highlights potential long-term targets between $10 and $37, while acknowledging that short-term market sentiment remains cautious. He argues that impatience and emotional selling often precede the biggest upside moves, and that today’s sideways action is more “preparation” than weakness. BlackRock Narrative and Macro Tailwinds Add Fuel Institutional narratives are also lining up behind XRP. At Swell 2025, BlackRock’s Maxwell Stein described the XRP Ledger as a scalable rail for trillions of dollars in tokenized assets and cross-border payments, reinforcing XRP’s status as a utility-driven asset rather than a purely speculative token. Related Reading: Bitcoin Death Cross Is Coming: Don’t Be Fooled By The Name With the Fed’s December rate decision approaching and risk appetite poised to shift, XRP now sits at the intersection of a powerful trio. Fresh ETF inflows, tightening technical patterns, and growing institutional validation. If these forces align, the XRPC launch may be remembered as the moment XRP’s next major rally truly began.

    "title": "Bitcoin Leverage Cooldown Signals Market Reset: OI Drops 21% As Excess Risk Is Flushed Out",
    "body": "Bitcoin continues to consolidate below the $105,000 mark, maintaining stability above the key $100,000 support level despite ongoing market uncertainty. Bulls appear to be losing momentum, yet sellers are showing signs of exhaustion as the price resists further decline. According to top analyst Darkfost, the market has entered a clear deleveraging phase following the major liquidation event on October 10 — a structural reset that is removing excessive leverage from the system. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Adds $105M To His ETH Position – $1.33B Bought Since Nov 4 Data shows that open interest — the total value of active futures contracts — has fallen by 21% over the past 90 days, marking one of the steepest declines of the cycle. This drop reflects traders reducing risk exposure and liquidations steadily clearing overleveraged positions. Darkfost notes that leverage usage is gradually cooling down, with the current drawdown echoing previous cleansing phases seen in September 2024 and April 2025. Historically, such periods of forced unwinding have preceded new market strength as liquidity stabilizes and speculative excess fades. Deleveraging Signals a Potential Turning Point for Bitcoin Darkfost explains that the current deleveraging phase bears striking similarities to previous corrective periods that ultimately paved the way for major recoveries. During the September 2024 and April 2025 corrections, open interest fell by approximately 24% and 29%, respectively — deep enough to flush out excessive speculation and restore balance across the market. With the current 21% decline in open interest over the last three months, Bitcoin is now approaching those same historical levels of leverage reduction. According to Darkfost, these phases are not necessarily bearish; instead, they serve as healthy resets during bullish market cycles. By forcing overleveraged traders to exit and cooling down speculative behavior, the market is able to rebuild on a stronger, more stable foundation. In past cycles, such unwinding events were often followed by trend reversals once selling pressure eased and new demand emerged. The reduction in leverage also tends to attract long-term investors and institutions seeking lower-risk entry points. If Bitcoin continues to hold its ground above $100K through this period of structural cleanup, it could signal that the worst of the correction is over, setting the stage for a potential new impulse phase once confidence returns. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inflows To Binance Surge: Daily Average Hits 7,500 BTC BTC Tests Support As Consolidation Continues Above $100K The weekly Bitcoin chart shows that BTC remains in a tight consolidation range between $100,000 and $105,000, testing key structural support. The price has repeatedly defended the 100-day moving average (blue line), indicating that despite sustained selling pressure, buyers continue to step in around this psychological zone. The overall trend remains bullish on higher timeframes, with the 200-week moving average (red line) trending upward and well below current price action — a signal that Bitcoin’s long-term market structure remains intact. However, momentum indicators reflect weakness, as BTC struggles to reclaim the $110,000 resistance level that capped previous rebound attempts. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH-MVRV Rebounds From Local Low – Potential Recovery Toward $115K–$120K Trading volume has decreased since the October liquidation event, aligning with Darkfost’s observation that the market is undergoing a deleveraging phase. This lower volume environment suggests investor hesitation but also indicates that forced selling may be nearing exhaustion. A decisive weekly close above $106,000 could confirm renewed bullish momentum, while a breakdown below $100,000 might trigger deeper corrections toward $92,000 — the next major support zone.

    "body": "Solana (SOL) is once again under intense market scrutiny as a combination of fading memecoin activity, declining user engagement, and continuous token unlocks by Alameda Research puts pressure on one of crypto’s strongest 2025 performers. Related Reading: Ethereum Ready To Explode To $12,000 By January, Says Tom Lee While institutional inflows via ETFs remain robust, Solana’s ability to defend key technical levels, particularly the $140–$150 demand zone, will determine whether the asset stabilizes or slides into a deeper correction. Memecoin Cooldown Sends User Activity to One-Year Low Solana’s explosive rise in late 2024 and early 2025 was largely fueled by rapid memecoin launches and hyperactive retail speculation. But that frenzy has sharply cooled. According to Glassnode and The Block, the number of daily active addresses has dropped to 3.3 million, down from over 9 million at the start of the year, marking a 12-month low. Most of the decline comes from the disappearance of bots and short-term users who flooded the chain during its speculative peak. This slowdown has immediate consequences. Lower address activity has translated into softer fee revenue and thinner liquidity, making SOL more sensitive to market shocks. Analysts warn that until new high-utility use cases, such as payments, gaming, or real-world asset apps, attract stickier users, Solana’s engagement metrics may continue to oscillate with speculative cycles. Despite this decline, Solana’s ecosystem remains fundamentally strong. Its DeFi TVL stands at nearly $10 billion, supported by Jupiter, Jito, and Kamino, while developers continue to build stablecoin primitives, high-throughput consumer applications, and institutional-grade infrastructure, such as Firedancer. SOL's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD chart from Tradingview Alameda Unlocks Clash With Record Solana ETF Inflows Another major pressure point is the ongoing monthly SOL unlocks from the FTX/Alameda bankruptcy estate. On November 11, Alameda unstaked 193,000 SOL ($30 million), part of a vesting schedule that runs through 2028. These tokens often find their way to exchanges, creating short-term selling pressure. However, institutional demand is delivering the opposite effect. Solana has now recorded 10–11 consecutive days of ETF inflows, totaling $336 million for the week. Bitwise and Grayscale Solana ETFs collectively hold $351 million, and even traditional institutions like Rothschild Investment and PNC Financial Services have disclosed new positions. SoFi Bank’s move to enable direct SOL purchases from U.S. checking accounts has further legitimized Solana within the regulated finance sector. This tug-of-war, systematic selling vs. accelerating inflows, defines Solana’s current volatility. Technical Setup: $140 Is the Line in the Sand SOL is trading around $152–$156, having broken below key support at $156 amid rising volume. Indicators remain bearish: OBV continues trending downward, signaling persistent seller dominance. Market structure shows lower highs and lower lows since early November. Liquidity heatmaps reveal strong magnetic zones at $144 and $140, making a retest highly likely. Analysts view $140 as the crucial support area. If it fails, liquidity extends toward $120, opening the door for a deeper correction.

    "body": "On Thursday, the Bitcoin price fell toward the $98,000 mark, with November shaping up to mirror October’s performance as the market’s leading cryptocurrency continues to hit lower lows over the past month, confirming a prevalent downtrend in the market. Bitcoin Price Uncertainty Grows Post-Government Shutdown This downturn is indicative of growing market uncertainty, particularly following President Donald Trump’s signing of a bill that ended the longest government shutdown in US history on Wednesday. Related Reading: Solana at a Breaking Point: Fading Memecoin Hype and Alameda Unlocks Test the $140 Support Zone More concerning, market analyst Ali Martinez has suggested that the Bitcoin price may be forming a head-and-shoulders pattern. According to his analysis, this could set the stage for a significant drop to as low as $83,000. This would represent an additional 15% decline if the pattern holds true. Adding to the worries for bullish investors, Bitcoin has recently fallen below its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), an historical key technical support for the cryptocurrency’s price in bullish cycles. The expert now indicates that a break below this key level during bear markets often leads to significant declines, potentially leading the Bitcoin price under its realized price, currently pegged at $56,200. This would imply that BTC could see a further 42% drop from current trading prices. Crypto Winter Looms Despite the expectation of bullish catalysts such as increased liquidity and potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, along with positive macroeconomic data, the outlook for the Bitcoin price suggests the possibility of a new bear market. Related Reading: $1.33B Ethereum Whale Just Moved Another $120M USDT to Binance – Details Ali Martinez’s analysis implies that bearish sentiment is gaining momentum, raising concerns about an impending “crypto winter” unfolding for investors once again this year. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $98,150, marking a loss of nearly 13% over the past thirty days and erasing most of the gains it had accumulated throughout the year. In this time frame, it has only posted a 9% gain. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Earns Academic Praise: University Study Calls It ‘Gold In Your Hands’",
    "body": "According to reports, a bipartisan draft bill in the US Senate has reignited arguments about whether XRP is a commodity or a security. Related Reading: XRP Has Held Its Ground As Most Altcoins Fall, Market Observers Say The Bipartisan Market Structure Draft would divide oversight: the Commodity Futures Trading Commission would police digital commodities like XRP and Bitcoin, while the Securities and Exchange Commission would keep authority over traditional securities. Proponents say the move could remove years of legal uncertainty for many tokens. Durham Study Frames XRP As Commodity Based on reports, academic work from Durham University has entered the debate. Ludovico Rella published a paper in the Journal Of Cultural Economy five years ago that examined how money works as both a tool and a social system. Rella used Ripple and XRP as main examples and described XRP as a “radical form of commodity money.” He also used the term “digital metallism” to show how XRP can be seen as a self-standing asset that holds value without relying on company liabilities or shares. What stands out most is his vivid description of XRP as “like gold in your hands” — a digital asset designed to be “the most liquid of assets on the XRP Ledger.” XRP’s Dual Role In Payments Rella argued that XRP plays two clear roles. It behaves like a digital asset with commodity-like traits and it also serves as part of Ripple’s payment network, acting as a bridge asset for moving money across borders. The study traces Ripple’s path from a trust-based mutual credit system to a blockchain-powered payments network focused on speed and liquidity. That historical arc helps explain why some users treat XRP as an independent store of value while others use it as a tool for cross-border transfers. Lawmakers Push For Clarity Reports have disclosed that senators behind the draft want to make legal lines cleaner so firms and markets know which rules apply. Many in the XRP community reacted quickly, pointing to the 2023 court ruling that found XRP was not a security as evidence that the token belongs under CFTC oversight. Commentators in the space argue the combination of that court decision and new legislation could finally put the question to rest. Related Reading: Dogecoin Alert! Price Could Explode Over 2,800%, Analyst Says Market Moves Add Weight To The Debate Data cited by community members has been used to underline the argument. According to reports, XRP now processes over $5 trillion a year, and Ripple executives have spoken about CBDC pilots and network growth that could place XRP at the center of large payment flows. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has set a target of capturing 14% of SWIFT’s $150 trillion volume, a share that would represent about $40 trillion by 2030 if reached. Price action has followed the chatter: XRP traded at $2.50, up from $2.40 and showing a 4% gain at the time of the latest report. Daily trade volume rose by 52%, with nearly $5.8 billion in XRP changing hands. Featured image from Gemini, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Analyst Predicts XRP “Supply Crisis” To Trigger The Next Parabolic Rally",
    "body": "An analyst has sounded the alarm on what could become one of the most explosive rally in XRP’s history. As the cryptocurrency prepares for its long-awaited Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) debut, the balance of XRP on major exchanges continues to decline. Analysts are warning that an impending supply crisis could spark a significant surge in the XRP price, which is currently more than 34% below its all-time high levels. XRP Supply Shortage To Trigger Parabolic Surge Amidst ongoing market volatility and whale capitulation, crypto market expert Arthur remains positive about XRP, drawing attention to a series of on-chain developments that could mark the beginning of a parabolic upward move. In his post on X social media, the analyst emphasized that an XRP could soon see a supply crisis, which may ignite its next price explosion. Related Reading: Pundit Reveals Final Nail In The Coffin For XRP, What This Means According to recent chart data from CryptoQuant, XRP reserves on Binance have fallen to about 2.79 million tokens, marking a sustained decline that began in early 2025. The chart also shows that while XRP’s price has remained relatively stable between $2 and $3, the available supply on almost all major cryptocurrency exchanges has continued to decline drastically. Arthur has revealed that this signals a growing imbalance between supply and demand, which could set the foundation for a bullish move. Arthur has also referenced a prediction made by JPMorgan analysts, who estimated that between $4 to $8 billion could flow into the upcoming XRP Spot ETFs once they launch in the market. This projection indicates confidence in XRP’s future institutional demand and interest as a legitimate digital asset class. The analyst has suggested that increased ETF demand from institutions, combined with limited liquidity, could create a “perfect storm” for a price breakout of XRP. Additionally, the analyst has revealed that the XRP ETF could also see a surge in retail demand, contributing to its projected price appreciation. Currently, reports indicate that approval of XRP Spot ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still pending. However, prominent analysts like Nate Geraci remain confident that these investment products will be launched soon. Binance XRP Reserve Data Shows Steady Losses Delving deeper into XRP’s supply on exchanges, CryptoQuant’s data shows that the cryptocurrency’s reserve on Binance is sitting at approximately 2.785 billion tokens as of November 12, 2025. Notably, this marks a decrease of over 10 million tokens from the previous day, when 2.795 billion XRP was recorded. Since the beginning of November, Binance’s XRP balance has been declining, hovering just above the 2.7 billion token threshold. Related Reading: $300 Million Worth Of XRP On The Move – Where Are They Headed? Earlier in October, reserves dipped to 2.74 billion tokens, one of the lowest levels recorded in almost a year. While balances briefly rebounded in mid-October, the latest data shows a renewed downward trajectory, suggesting that selling pressure may have eased and accumulation could be taking place off exchanges.

    "body": "In a latest update, BeLaunch posed the high-stakes question: Could SUI really reach $20 in the next bull cycle? After getting hit hard during the October 10 flash crash, SUI is starting to show strength again, and the charts are now painting a very interesting picture that could signal the beginning of a major turnaround. Potential Scenarios For SUI BeLaunch recently outlined two possible scenarios for SUI’s next move, each with distinct probabilities and implications. According to the analysis, the token is currently at a critical juncture, where its next few moves could determine the broader market‘s direction. Related Reading: SUI Eyes Key Retest As Price Breaks Out Of Downtrend – Rally To $3 Ahead? In the primary scenario, which carries an 8/10 probability, SUI is testing a crucial breakout above the red dashed resistance line. Wave (2) appears to have completed its cycle, setting the stage for Wave (3) — typically one of the most impulsive moves in the Elliott Wave structure. A confirmed breakout at this level could propel SUI toward new highs. The alternative scenario, rated at a 3/10 probability, suggests that the current price structure could remain corrective. In this case, SUI may form an alternative X wave near the $5.37 region before extending into another corrective phase (Alt Y). Although less likely, BeLaunch noted that traders should still monitor this possibility closely. Technical and On-Chain Alignment Suggests Market Bottom Nearing According to BeLaunch, on-chain fundamentals for SUI are showing early signs of recovery, despite broader market attention remaining elsewhere. The data reveals that Total Value Locked (TVL) has been holding firm around $1.4 billion, though the analyst notes that a move above the $2 billion threshold would mark a more decisive shift in momentum. At the same time, Daily Active Users (DAU) have been climbing gradually, now sitting near 900,000. Related Reading: Analyst Says SUI Price Could Be Heading To $9: 4 Reasons Why BeLaunch noted that despite this encouraging on-chain behavior, SUI’s price remains lagging, a common indicator of a classic accumulation phase. During such periods, investors often underestimate the asset’s underlying strength while long-term players quietly position themselves ahead of a potential breakout. Historically, SUI has shown a tendency to rally within two to four weeks after both TVL and DAU metrics begin trending upward. If this pattern repeats, it could signal that SUI is currently in a quiet accumulation window before a stronger move to the upside. This alignment between historical behavior and present data gives a subtle yet compelling bullish undertone. Overall, BeLaunch emphasized that the technical and on-chain setup appears robust. Fundamentals are stabilizing, momentum indicators are shifting, and WaveTrend signals are flashing a bottom below 40. If the current trend persists, SUI could soon emerge from consolidation and enter a new bullish phase. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Who’s Selling Bitcoin? Fidelity Research Boss Breaks It Down",
    "body": "Visible buying from spot bitcoin ETPs and corporates has not translated into decisive upside, leaving traders to ask a blunt question: who is supplying the market? For Chris Kuiper, CFA, vice president of research at Fidelity Digital Assets, the answer is clear. “ ‘Who is selling?’ is the number one question I’ve been getting regarding bitcoin’s continued price pressure against a backdrop of visible buying,” he wrote on X on November 12. “I’m not unique in suggesting it’s the long-term holders (or HODLers).” Kuiper points to a simple but powerful on-chain gauge: the percentage of outstanding bitcoin that has not moved for at least one year. Glassnode’s “Percent of Supply Last Active 1+ Years Ago” rises in bear markets as coins age in place and investors sit on unrealized losses, then typically falls sharply when bull markets let those same investors exit into strength. Related Reading: Bitcoin Death Cross Is Coming: Don’t Be Fooled By The Name “As you can see in the chart below, this line goes up during bear markets … and then usually a dramatic decline as these longer-term holders sell into the strength of a bull market,” Kuiper explained. What stands out to him today is that “with this cycle” the drawdown is “a relatively gentle slope down.” When bitcoin hit new highs earlier this year, the long-term-holder line “didn’t plunge,” he said. Instead, the market has been experiencing “a consistent slow bleed as the market has slowly moved sideways and up.” That slow bleed aligns with what Kuiper says he hears from the client side. “Bitcoin’s performance has recently lagged gold’s, even the S&P, and people are getting tired,” he wrote. Many investors, in his view, had been positioned for a textbook four-year cycle blow-off and were “waiting to sell into the historically strong seasonality of October and now November.” When October’s typical strength did not materialize and year-end approached, “long-term holders are looking to make year-end tax and positional changes, calling it a day with the gains they already have.” Related Reading: Bitcoin “Arguably Undervalued,” Says Analytics Firm: Here’s Why The Glassnode chart shows how different this looks from past cycles. In the 2017–2018 run-up and subsequent reversal, the share of coins last active more than a year ago rolled over violently as price spiked and then collapsed. In the current cycle, the curve that represents long-term-holder supply has been trending lower since 2023, but without the vertical collapse normally associated with euphoric distribution. On-chain analyst Julio Moreno of CryptoQuant added another layer by reframing the same dynamic as “1-year inactive supply drawdown” in percentage points of total supply. “Here’s another way to visualize this,” he replied to Kuiper, “by looking at the 1-year inactive supply drawdown in terms of % of total Bitcoin supply.” Moreno quantified the last three major cycles. In 2017–2018, 1-year inactive supply declined by about 20 percentage points of total supply. In the 2021 cycle, the drawdown was around 10 percentage points. In the 2024–2025 period so far, the decline is again roughly 10 percentage points. The CryptoQuant chart, which uses an inverted scale, renders that as a purple wave that rises as more long-dormant coins are spent or reallocated. This means that long-term holders have already released a volume of supply comparable to the 2021 cycle, even if it is still well below the 2017–2018 peak. What differs is the tempo. Rather than a short burst of profit-taking at the top, the market has absorbed roughly a 10-percentage-point reduction in inactive supply over a longer, choppier price path. Kuiper welcomed the alternative visualization, replying simply: “Great chart!” He also made clear what he will be monitoring from here. “I will be watching this slope along with some other metrics to gauge seller exhaustion,” he said. For now, he argues that “the positive fundamental developments and lackluster price action continue to diverge.” At press time, BTC traded at $102,609.

    "title": "Bitcoin Moves Beyond Retail — Institutional Ownership Now Defines The Market",
    "body": "Bitcoin is no longer the speculative playground it once was. What began as a retail-driven movement powered by early adopters and crypto enthusiasts has evolved into a market increasingly shaped by institutional capital, from BTC ETFs absorbing billions in inflows to corporations and hedge funds adding BTC to their balance sheets. Why Institutional Accumulation Has Changed Bitcoin Volatility The narrative around Bitcoin has undergone a fundamental transaction. According to the Arch Network post on X, the institutional participant in Bitcoin is no longer emerging; it’s already established. Spot Bitcoin ETF now holds over 1 million BTC, which is roughly 5% of the total supply. Daily inflows through mid-2025 have averaged between $300 and $500 million, with a cumulative asset close to $60 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Recovers Past $105K as Shutdown Relief and Whale Buying Fuel Bullish Reversal Furthermore, the reach of this integration is global, with more than half of the world’s top asset managers now having indirect exposure to BTC through these accessible ETF structures. However, while this level of adoption is bullish, a significant challenge is that most of this BTC remains idle in cold storage. This model secures exposure but fundamentally does not generate return. Presently, for the institutions managing trillions in assets, the model is losing relevance. A productive BTC stack that combines robust security with consistent yield generation is becoming the natural next step for capital markets. An ambassador at NEARProtocol and Somnia_Network, Trader Onur, has highlighted that Bitcoin ETF recorded $524 million daily inflows on Tuesday, marking the biggest since the crash. The derivatives market is flashing similar signals that smart money just stacked $8.5 million in BTC longs. This shows retailers are still nervous, but institutions are quietly positioning. If the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) print is favorable, it could set the tone for the year-end momentum. How Flows Can Confirm Or Contradict Market Mood The selling momentum in Bitcoin spot ETF flows has stalled for now. A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, has pointed out that the BTC price has held the $100,000 region for now, as a lot of outflows and bad sentiment have taken place. However, the BTC price is also failing to push higher on the back of it. Related Reading: Bitcoin At A Battleground — This Price Range Will Decide the Next Cycle Phase As Daan noted, ETF flow data is a lagging indicator and useful mostly in hindsight. Nonetheless, when large outflows occur and the price refuses to drop further, it could be considered as short-term bullish absorption. Additionally, when heavy inflows fail to lift the price higher, it can signal local tops. These patterns have played out multiple times in this cycle, and they often occur at the key pivot zones where market direction shifts. Daan believes that it’s still valuable to watch how the price behaves around major ETF in- and outflow days. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Suggests Investors Are Extremely Fearful The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment that’s present among traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Chainlink’s Next Major Move Comes After This Range, Analyst Says The index uses the data of the following five factors to determine the investor mentality: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social sentiment, and Google Trends. It then represents the sentiment using a scale running from 0 to 100. All values above 53 correspond to a net sentiment of greed, while those below 47 imply fear in the market. The indicator being between these two cutoffs naturally suggests a neutral mentality among the investors. Besides these three main zones, there are also two “extreme” sentiments: extreme fear and extreme greed. The former takes place below 25 and the latter above 75. Currently, the Fear & Greed Index is in one of these zones. As is visible above, the Fear & Greed Index has a value of 15 at the moment, firmly inside the extreme fear territory. Sentiment among investors was already poor on Wednesday, but this latest value is even worse. The deterioration of sentiment is a result of Bitcoin retracing its recent recovery. While traders may be highly bearish toward the market right now, BTC and other assets don’t necessarily have to live up to expectations. In fact, if history is anything to go by, cryptocurrencies have often shown moves that directly go contrary to the crowd’s opinion. Many major tops and bottoms in the sector have formed alongside a sentiment of extreme greed and extreme fear, respectively. Given this, it’s possible that the latest foray into extreme fear could also lead to a bottom for Bitcoin and others. When that might happen, however, is anyone’s guess. The latest extreme fear sentiment is the strongest since early March, but the low back then didn’t coincide with BTC’s real bottom. That said, Bitcoin did find a temporary turnaround just a few days after, which lasted until the end of the month. In April, the market crashed again, and the Fear & Greed Index declined to a low of 18. This time, the extreme fear sentiment was enough to reignite real bullish momentum.

BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $103,100, down 2% over the last 24 hours. Featured image from Dall-E, Alternative.me, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "XRP price started a fresh decline from $2.550. The price is now showing bearish signs and might extend losses if it dips below $2.250. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.450 zone. The price is now trading below $2.40 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $2.235 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

The price started a fresh decline below $2.450 and $2.420. There was a move below the $2.320 pivot level. A low was formed at $2.2754, and the price is now consolidating losses with a bearish angle below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2.525 swing high to the $2.2754 low. The price is now trading below $2.40 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.2350 level. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $2.235 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $2.40 level, above which the price could rise and test $2.450 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2.525 swing high to the $2.2754 low. A clear move above the $2.450 resistance might send the price toward the $2.520 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.580 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.650. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.40 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.280 level. The next major support is near the $2.250 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.250 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.20. The next major support sits near the $2.120 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.050.

    "title": "First Spot XRP ETF Smashes Initial Expectations, Expert Suggests Record-Breaking Debut",
    "body": "Canary’s spot XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has surpassed most of the experts’ predictions, and it is currently on track to see a record-breaking debut after registering strong institutional demand on its first day. Related Reading: Winklevoss Twins Back Zcash (ZEC) Treasury Company With $58M Investment First Spot XRP ETF Begins Trading On Thursday, the first single-token XRP spot ETF began trading on Nasdaq, smashing the initial performance expectations of multiple experts after clearing the last regulatory hurdles this week. Following the launch of Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF (XRPC), the investment management firm asserted its conviction that “XRP Ledger represents a leading framework for global payments — purpose-built for interoperability and real-world settlement.” Notably, Canary Capital recently completed its 8-A filing for its XRPC ETF with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and received the stock exchange’s green light on Wednesday afternoon. The Thursday launch comes amid the end of the US Government shutdown, which officially lasted 43 days and was forecasted to delay the long-awaited Altcoin ETFs until its conclusion. For context, the SEC was expected to approve multiple crypto-based investment products between early October and November, after the regulatory agency postponed the decision deadline in Q3 and released new generic listing standards for the products. However, the second wave of crypto-based investment products arrived despite the government setback, with the first set of ETFs launching over two weeks ago. On October 28, Canary Capital’s spot Litecoin and Hedera ETFs and Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) began trading after filing 8-A forms with the SEC. As crypto journalist Eleanor Terret explained, the launch was possible because an open government wasn’t required to continue the process, and the 8-A filings are “just as important” as the S-1 forms, since they register ETF shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Canary’s XRPC To Challenge BSOL’s Debut Ahead of the launch, multiple experts predicted that Canary’s spot XRP ETF could see strong demand and reach between $15 million and $35 million in volume on its first day. Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, Eric Balchunas, initially suggested that the investment product could hit $17 million in volume. Following the first half-hour, the XRP ETF saw $26 million in volume, the analyst noted, breaking past his original expectations. As a result, Balchunas suggested that the XRPC had a “good shot” at surpassing BSOL’s first-day volume and becoming the biggest ETF launch of 2025. As reported by NewsBTC, Bitwise’s SOL Staking ETF recorded an impressive volume of $10 million in the first 30 minutes of trading, which surged to $33 million by the half-day mark. The investment product closed its first day with around $57 million in volume, beating all other launches of this year.

In the afternoon, analyst James Seyffart noted that Canary’s XRP ETF had recorded around $46 million in volume by the half-day mark, with a few more hours of trading ahead. The analyst initially suggested that XRPC could see around $34 million in volume on day one. “This is almost guaranteed to be near the top of the list for 2025 launches and still has a shot at beating $BSOL for the top spot,” Seyffart concluded. As of this writing, XRP trades at $2.30, a 3.3% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "On-chain data shows Bitcoin long-term holders have been ramping up their selling recently, a potential reason behind BTC’s fall under $100,000. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Been Booking Profits In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the latest trend in the supply of the Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs). These are referred to as the investors holding their coins for a period longer than 155 days, without selling or involving them in a transaction on the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Most Fearful Since March: Is A Bottom Near? Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them in the future. As such, the LTHs with their long holding times are usually considered to be resolute entities. Despite their resilience, however, there are times when even these diamond hands can decide to part with their holdings. One such time happens to be right now. As the below chart shared by Glassnode shows, the Bitcoin LTHs have been reducing their supply recently. This latest wave of selling from the LTHs isn’t their first for the cycle. As is apparent in the graph, these HODLers sold into both the 2024 rallies as well. In between these selloffs, their supply was rising with significant speed. Something to note is that while LTH selling is instantly registered in the chart, the same isn’t true for buying. When the LTH supply grows, it doesn’t mean any accumulation is happening in the present. Rather, what it implies is that some coins were bought five months ago, which have now been held long enough to clear the LTH threshold. The last wave of coin maturation into the LTH cohort peaked in mid-2025. Since then, the group has been shedding coins at a variable rate. The latest trend has clearly been that of acceleration, as the below chart visualizes. The accelerating wave of distribution from the LTHs has arrived as Bitcoin has been suffering from bearish momentum. It’s possible that some of the HODLers are thinking this could be their last chance to take profits, so they have decided to exit.

Historically, bull markets have sustained so long as fresh demand has kept coming in to absorb the selling from the diamond hands, so it remains to be seen whether the price plunge will be met with an injection of demand, or if this selling will lead into an extended bearish phase for Bitcoin. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $98,500, down 3% over the last 24 hours. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "By The Numbers: First Spot XRP ETF Achieves Record Launch Amid 900 Competitors",
    "body": "Canary Capital’s XRP ETF made a historic debut on Thursday, surpassing its competitors by hitting $58 million in trading volume on its first day, setting a record for the most traded ETF launch this year. This milestone was lauded by Bloomberg expert Eric Balchunas on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), underlining the remarkable success of the XRP ETF in the market. The launch of the first XRP ETF in the United States earlier today had a notable impact on the XRP price, propelling it towards the crucial $2.5 level. However, subsequent market movements saw a 4% retracement, bringing the token’s current trading price to $2.3. XRP ETF Potential Canary Capital’s CEO, Steven McClur, recently expressed confidence in the potential of an XRP ETF, suggesting that it could outperform the achievements of Solana (SOL). He highlighted XRP’s strong liquidity and global utility, foreseeing substantial institutional investment influx in the near future. The XRP ETF by Canary Capital has indeed outperformed Bitwise’s Solana Staking exchange-traded fund, with a trading volume of $57 million, falling just short of Canary’s fund by a mere million-dollar difference. Related Reading: Who’s Selling Bitcoin? Fidelity Research Boss Breaks It Down Analysts predict that the approval of asset managers like Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and Grayscale in the upcoming days of November could attract significant institutional investments ranging from $4 to $8 billion, potentially leading to a substantial price surge due to the low liquidity in the market. As a result, market analysts foresee a bullish rally for XRP, hinting that the token may be approaching the end of consolidation. They suggest long-term price targets ranging from $10 to $37. If these bullish scenarios materialize, these surges could result in new all-time highs and significant potential gains, with projections of 334% and a staggering 1,500%, respectively, from current trading levels. XRP Price Could See 150% Increase To $6 by 2030 In addition to the significant ETF debut by Canary Capital, industry experts like Dark Defender have shared key technical analyses that could complement the performance of the XRP ETF market. Notably, Dark Defender highlighted signals on the weekly time frame indicating a potential surge for XRP, with resistance at $2.85, support at $2.22, and targets projected at $18.22 and $36.76.

Analysts at the Motley Fool have also weighed in, drawing parallels to Bitcoin’s (BTC) price appreciation following the SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, projecting a 150% increase to $6 for XRP by 2030.

    "title": "The Descending Channel That Can Trigger A Bitcoin Price Crash To $88,000",
    "body": "Over the last few weeks, analysts have been predicting that the Bitcoin price could crash again after the initial October 10 crash. This is because of the weakening market trends that have shown that Bitcoin is still favoring a downtrend at this point. Crypto analyst Lixing_Gan on the TradingView website also shares this view, with the appearance of a descending trend pattern that suggests that the Bitcoin price is more likely to fall than rise. Bitcoin Price At Risk Of Major Crash Below $90,000 So far, the Bitcoin price has been able to maintain its hold above the psychological level of $100,000, despite bears briefly pushing the price below this level. It has been trading in a tight range of $101,000 to $105,000 during this time, but with no notable momentum that could push its price higher. This tight range, unfortunately, plays into the descending pattern that maps a path downward. Related Reading: Abundance of Catalysts Suggests XRP Price Could Take Off This Week According to the crypto analyst’s chart, the descending pattern was formed at the start of October, well before the historic 10/10 crash. This means that the bearish trend had begun much earlier, and the resultant crash was only in response to bullish positions weakening across the board. This was triggered by massive sell-offs, mainly among whales and holders that have held onto their BTC for a notable amount of time. Over the last few months, these long-term holders have sold off more than 390,000 BTC, triggering billions of dollars in selling pressure. Given this, it is no surprise that the Bitcoin price broke down the way it did at the start of October. These sell-offs from the long-term holders, though, the crypto analyst believes, are a distribution phase. As they sell off their holdings to newer investors, the cost basis for each Bitcoin begins to rise, increasing the likelihood that buyers will hold for longer. Looking at the descending trendline from here, technical analysis suggests that the Bitcoin price is still testing the upper bound of the trendline. As the analyst explains, this upper bound happens to coincide with $106,500, which has been a major resistance for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Institutions Have Been Buying Solana Every Day For 2 Weeks, Is $300 Possible? In addition to the resistance above $106,000, the Bitcoin Ichimoku cloud also shows a rise in bearish pressure. This means that the $100,000 psychological level is still at risk, and if it breaks, then the current decline could deepen. The targets for this Bitcoin price crash lie well below the $90,000 level. The first major support is at $93,000, but a break below here could extend the decline to as low as $88,000 before the bulls find their footing again.

    "title": "Bitcoin Maximalism Is Fading As Top Altcoins Like PEPENODE Rise",
    "body": "What to Know: Bitcoin’s ETF-driven evolution into digital gold is softening strict maximalism and encouraging more diversified crypto portfolios. Capital is rotating into top altcoins with real narratives, especially in infrastructure, AI and DePIN rather than pure speculation. PEPENODE mixes meme culture with gamified virtual mining and multi token rewards to keep holders engaged. For most of crypto’s history the script was simple: own Bitcoin, ignore everything else. That mindset is fading. Bitcoin now behaves more like digital gold, while the real experimentation (and much of the upside) is shifting to newer chains and app layers. Spot Bitcoin ETFs accelerated that shift. Many veteran holders in the US are moving coins from self custody into ETF wrappers to gain tax advantages and easier reporting without giving up long term $BTC exposure. Yes, OG whales definitely aren’t selling their Bitcoin for nothing – they’re going the ETF way. On chain, that unlocks fresh capital that no longer needs to sit idle. Instead of chasing random memes, that capital is rotating into infrastructure and narrative rich plays. High throughput networks like Avalanche, DePIN platforms such as Peaq and experimental designs like Kaspa’s blockDAG are drawing serious research time from investors who once swore they would never touch an altcoin. In this more mature market, Bitcoin can remain the macro anchor, while the upside shifts toward the top altcoins that pair clear stories with working products and lean tokenomics. Meme coins still matter, but they now need actual hooks. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) tries to be one of those hooks. It blends Pepe style culture with a mine to earn model that turns virtual mining into a browser based strategy game. With more than $2.1M already raised at a presale price of $0.0011454 and 605% staking rewards, it gives rotated Bitcoin profits a defined, higher risk lane. PEPENODE’s Mine-To-Earn Model And Presale In One Snapshot PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) starts from a basic problem – most crypto presales and staking pools are passive: you buy, you lock, you wait, and attention fades long before launch. The project’s whitepaper instead describes a virtual mining simulator. After TGE, holders will build a server room inside a web app by buying Miner Nodes and upgrading Facilities with $PEPENODE. A dashboard tracks simulated hashrate, energy use and rewards so it feels like running a mining farm without hardware, noise or power bills. PEPENODE also plugs into existing meme liquidity instead of ignoring it. Leaderboards and bonus pools aim to pay rewards not only in $PEPENODE but also in some of the best meme coins such as $PEPE and $FARTCOIN. One active position can become exposure to several assets, which appeals to traders who prefer to keep their stack working instead of parked in a single token. On the funding side, the presale runs as a community first public sale with no private rounds or insider allocations. Pricing began around $0.001 and sits at $0.0011454 in the current stage, with $ETH, $BNB, $USDT and card payments accepted. Here’s how to buy PEPENODE now. Early staking yields at 605% are live alongside the raise and are designed to step down as more tokens are locked, encouraging commitment rather than quick flips. Our $PEPENODE price prediction sees a potential high near $0.0031 in 2025, with a 2026 range between roughly $0.0022 and $0.0077 if the game ships on time and user numbers grow. From a presale level around $0.0011454, that translates into indicative moves of about 2.7x at the first target and up to roughly 6.7x at the top of the 2026 band. For investors who now hold Bitcoin exposure through ETFs and want a defined risk sleeve for growth, PEPENODE offers a narrative that lines up with the wider rotation into utility driven altcoins and interactive on chain products. Consider PepeNode when shaping your next altcoin sleeve. This article is informational only, not financial advice; cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and can lead to full loss of invested capital.

    "title": "Jack Dorsey’s Cash App Backs Stablecoins On Solana – Why That’s Bullish For Best Wallet Token ($BEST)",
    "body": "What to Know: Cash App will add stablecoin send/receive using Solana rails in 2026, pushing fast, low-cost dollar payments into the mainstream. Stablecoin UX at scale shifts power to wallets that simplify cross-chain swaps, presales access, and spending – the core Best Wallet stack. Best Wallet’s utility narrative – multichain, non-custodial, integrated DEX, card roadmap – maps cleanly onto the new payments landscape. $BEST’s $17M+ presale has a $0.025945 price, with 77% APY staking that declines over time to balance rewards and supply. Jack Dorsey just widened the rails for mainstream crypto payments. Cash App unveiled plans to let users send and receive stablecoins, with the rollout targeted for 2026. In a twist that may raise maxi eyebrows, the feature will initially lean on Solana’s network for speed and cost efficiency rather than Bitcoin’s base chain. Stable, fast, cheap – the combo is tailor-made for everyday payments and remittances. Cash App’s announcement pairs with a broader push: Lightning Network support for consumer payments now, stablecoins next. The message is simple – keep Bitcoin as money, use super-fast stablecoins for dollar-denominated spending. It’s a blueprint others can follow, and it puts stablecoin UX front and center for tens of millions of US users. That kind of distribution tends to ripple across wallets, DEXs, and on-chain tools that help people actually hold and move assets. ⚡️ Solana’s selection isn’t random. The network already handles large stablecoin flows thanks to low latency and low fees. If Cash App pipes $USDC over Solana, millions will experience chain-native payments that settle in seconds. This is the moment self-custody wallets have been waiting for: lower friction, more volume, broader use cases. Projects positioned at the wallet layer – where users start and finish transactions – look set to benefit most. And that’s where the Best Wallet app and its native Best Wallet Token ($BEST) come in. 🏆 Best Wallet marries a multi-chain, non-custodial wallet with a token that unlocks cheaper fees, staking rewards, and curated access to vetted presales. With payment rails going stable and fast, the next winners likely sit where users manage assets, swap across chains, and discover new opportunities – all in one place. That’s the $BEST thesis in a nutshell, and the Cash App news strengthens it. Best Wallet Lines Up With The New Stablecoin Reality The Best Wallet ecosystem lays out a practical, mobile-first stack: a non-custodial wallet, an integrated DEX aggregator powered by Rubic for best-rate cross-chain swaps, and a forthcoming Best Card for spending. The $BEST token ties it together with reduced in-app fees, governance rights, and direct access to ‘Upcoming Tokens’ – a presale portal that removes third-party risks and friction. In short, it’s a self-custody hub designed for what users actually do. 📖 Discover more about the Best Wallet Token in our detailed $BEST review. As more users meet stablecoins through familiar fintech frontends, many will look for deeper, lower-cost control via self-custody. Best Wallet’s presale aggregator and cross-chain swaps address the next steps: acquire assets directly, move them cheaply, and deploy them into opportunities – all without leaving your wallet. ⚙️ Utility isn’t hand-wavy either. The whitepaper details dynamic staking paid from a dedicated rewards allocation, plus smart-contract architecture on Ethereum for security and composability. That mix of EVM credibility and multichain reach fits a world where dollars move on Solana at retail scale while value accrues across chains. The wallet is the bridge; $BEST is the key. ⬇️ Download the Best Wallet app for free today. $BEST Presale Sails Past the $17M Milestone Presales live or die on clear value. Yesterday, however, the $BEST presale (now in its final two weeks) has surpassed the $17M mark. With the presale end rapidly drawing to a close, $BEST is currently priced at $0.025945. Staking is a central draw, too: early participants can lock $BEST at a 77% APY that dynamically declines as more holders join the pool. That structure aligns incentives – grow users, keep costs rational, and let APY normalize as TVL scales. 💰 Forward pricing also matters. Our price prediction for $BEST places the end-2026 target at a potential $0.05106175. From a $0.025945 entry, we’re talking an ROI of 96.8%. ➡️ Take a look at our guide to buying $BEST if you want to join the presale. Catalysts are mostly executional: expanding the wallet’s chain support and DEX depth, shipping the Best Card, and onboarding more vetted presales into the in-app portal. The official roadmap is pretty comprehensive in this sense. Context helps. Best Wallet – which has set an ambitious goal to capture ‘40% of the crypto wallet market share by the end of 2026‘ – is backed by Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP technology and a mobile-first UX. If stablecoin payments over Solana become routine, user onboarding will likely accelerate. As a non-custodial wallet that also lowers fees and opens curated deal flow, Best Wallet could well be the number one choice for many. That’s exactly where $BEST accrues value, making it one of the best crypto presales to join this year. 🚀 Ready to jump in? Head to the official presale page and buy your $BEST today.

    "title": "What Will Trigger The XRP 1,300% Break To $36 This Bull Cycle?",
    "body": "The weekly chart for XRP has compressed into a decisive structure that now sits on the edge of a major move, and the latest projection from crypto analyst Dark Defender outlines how this structure could push to as high as $36 this bull cycle. His outlook centers on an Elliott Wave pattern that started forming in June, and the chart behind the analysis shows a sequence that is approaching the point where momentum returns with force. Elliott Wave Structure Points To A Wave Three Expansion Technical analysis of the XRP’s weekly candlestick timeframe chart shows that the cryptocurrency has spent the past several months compressing inside a tightening structure, forming a narrowing support and resistance triangle. This analysis attempts to map out where this pressure leads next, particularly as XRP is now trading around the peak of this triangle, where volatility could return in force. Related Reading: Pundit Dunks On XRP Triple-Digit Dreams; Price Isn’t Going To $100 This Year Dark Defender’s projection is built on a five-wave Elliott structure that traces its origin back to mid-June, when XRP delivered its initial impulsive rally that formed Wave One. That first advance carried the price on a rally from the lower ranges into a new all-time high of $3.65 before losing steam. Since then, the second wave, which is naturally corrective based on the theory, has dragged the price action sideways to create lower highs beneath descending resistance and higher lows above the support. The chart below shows that this corrective phase is now entering its final stretch, with candles clustering inside the narrowing triangle. The technical message is straightforward: once the correction exhausts itself, the next phase of the Elliott count would be a Wave Three expansion. This third wave is the strongest and longest of the five waves, and it often receives the largest percentage gains in the entire cycle. The Breakout Zone: $2.22 Support And $2.85 Resistance The analysis marks two levels that now define XRP’s breakout conditions. The support band around $2.22 has held firm throughout the entire consolidation, providing the foundation of the structure. The resistance line is at $2.85, and this has capped every rally attempt since the summer. Related Reading: Chinese And US Governments Fighting Over Bitcoin? Here’s What We Know A weekly close above $2.85 is the trigger that would officially transition XRP out of Wave 2 and into the impulsive third wave. Any break below $2.22 would delay the bullish outlook. The Fibonacci extension levels on the chart indicate the next significant checkpoints after the Wave 3 expansion starts. The first leg of the anticipated impulse, the 261.8% extension, is located close to $5.85. However, the wider Wave 3 target is located at the 361.8% level around $18.22. Following this, the Wave 4 pullback is expected to cool the momentum before the final Wave 5 impulse completes the broader structure. The final wave reaches into the 423.6% extension, which is positioned around $36.76 on the price chart. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.31, down by 8.2% in the past 24 hours.
