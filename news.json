    "body": "XRP price started a strong increase above $2.00. The price is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above the $2.165 zone. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.00 zone. The price is now trading above $2.10 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $2.070 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above $2.20. XRP Price Regains Traction XRP price started a decent upward move above $2.00 and $2.020, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price gained pace for a clear move above the $2.10 resistance. The bulls even pumped the price above the $2.150 zone. A high was formed at $2.165 and the price started a consolidation phase above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.983 swing low to the $2.165 high. The price is now trading above $2.10 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $2.070 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.1650 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.180 level, above which the price could rise and test $2.20. A clear move above the $2.20 resistance might send the price toward the $2.250 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.320 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.350. Downside Correction? If XRP fails to clear the $2.1650 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline.

The next major support is near the $2.070 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.983 swing low to the $2.165 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.070 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.020. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.9650.

    "body": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) has ridden a fresh wave of speculative buying this week, with the token jumping nearly 20% while the broader meme coin sector surged. Related Reading: $18 Million Ethereum Loss Sends Whale Running To Gold According to Santiment, total meme coin valuation rose by about 23% over the period as traders piled back into higher-risk tokens. Trading volumes jumped from $2.16 billion to roughly $8.6 billion, a whopping increase that shows how fast money rotated into this corner of the market. Supply Concentration Raises Eyebrows Reports have disclosed that supply remains highly concentrated among a handful of wallets. The top 10 holders control over 60% of SHIB’s maximum supply, which equals around 1 quadrillion tokens. 🐶📈 Meme coins, the most “speculative” of assets, have proceeded with their post-holiday run. The entire meme market cap is now above $45.3B, growing by +20.8% in just the past week. 📊 Notable 7-day gainers include: 🪙 $PEPE +54% 🪙 $USELESS +54% 🪙 $MOG +38% 🪙 $DOG +36% 🪙… pic.twitter.com/htdfiXLaLf — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 4, 2026 Those wallets together hold about 630 trillion SHIB. Based on Santiment’s figures, the official burn wallet alone holds roughly 40% of the total supply, a stake valued at over $3 billion. This kind of concentration can magnify price swings if large holders move coins onto exchanges or sell. Technical Setup Points To A Test Analyst Charting Guy flagged the token’s weekly chart as “looking good” in a January 4 tweet, noting a strong weekly candle that closed up 22%. Based on reports, SHIB started 2026 at $0.000006904 and has since pushed higher. $SHIB weekly looks good pic.twitter.com/YigTTQ3kEW — Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) January 4, 2026 The meme coin briefly traded above $0.0000093 before a pullback and is currently around $0.000008766. Year-to-date gains sit near 32% and the token was up 5.14% over the past 24 hours and 17.31% over the last week. Charting Guy’s chart shows SHIB approaching the tip of a long-running descending trendline that traces back to a high of $0.0000334 in December 2024. A break above that line would raise the chance of a larger move higher. Meme Coins See Wide Gains Other tokens have also posted big moves. Dogecoin recorded about a 20% rise while Pepe surged roughly 65% over the same span. The group’s sharp gains came as speculative interest accelerated and traders chased short-term returns. Related Reading: A Maduro Bet, A Market Alarm: US Lawmaker Targets Trading Abuses Market Volume And Trader Behavior Santiment’s data highlights that trading activity spiked dramatically, signaling a swift return of hot money to meme coins. The jump from $2.17 billion to $8.7 billion in daily traded value shows more participants are active and willing to take bigger risks. Based on the mix of heavy supply concentration and a crowded technical setup, Shiba Inu’s path could widen in either direction. A decisive breakout above the descending trendline might extend last week’s rally, while heavy selling from large wallets could trigger sharp pullbacks.

    "title": "XRP Is Setting Up For Its ‘Next Explosive Move,’ Analysts Say: Here’s The Target",
    "body": "XRP is approaching a decision point across the monthly and daily charts, with renowned crypto analysts The Great Mattsby (Matt Hughes) and Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) framing the current structure as a volatility-compression setup that could resolve higher if key high-timeframe supports continue to hold. XRP Price Poised For ‘Explosive Move’ Mattsby’s core claim is that XRP has defended its long-term trend support and is now coiling for expansion. “XRP had a perfect bounce off the 20-month MA, while the upper and lower bands continue to contract—setting up for its next explosive move higher,” he wrote, adding: “It’s crazy how many people are bearish right at major high-time-frame support.” On the monthly chart, XRP is shown trading around $2.08629, sitting above the Bollinger basis near 1.89623, with the upper band labeled at $3.57705 and the lower band at $0.21541. The visual takeaway is the squeeze: the band envelope has tightened materially compared with prior periods, a condition Mattsby ties to “explosive” directional follow-through when it resolves. Related Reading: Jake Claver Doubles Down On $100 XRP Target After 2025 Miss The other important input on that panel is the 20-month moving average, which Mattsby highlights as the pivot. His October framing leans on historical rhyme: “XRP is repeating what it did back in 2017. Consolidate sideways for months until it touched the 20month MA. After that, it shot up to finish off the cycle.” In his view, the touch-and-hold dynamic is already in place this cycle, even if it’s “taking a little longer.” With the October 10 liquidation event, XRP pierced the 20-month moving average and has since consolidated above it. If that read holds, the most explicit upside reference on-chart is the monthly Bollinger upper band around $3.57705, a level that would represent a return to the top of the current volatility envelope rather than an open-ended projection. Wyckoff-Style Re-Accumulation Points To $8 Charting Guy’s daily chart overlays a Wyckoff-style roadmap and labels the sequence as a re-accumulation that transitions into markup. The yellow projection assumes XRP is still working through overhead supply, with the ~$2.08 area (marked by the blue horizontal line and aligned with the current print) acting as the immediate gatekeeper. In that framing, $2.08 is not a comfort-zone support level yet; it is a level XRP needs to reclaim decisively and then stay above on retests for the bullish sequence to keep validating. Related Reading: XRP Faces Strong Social Discontent—Is A 50% Bullish Reversal Just Around The Corner? A second constraint on the chart is the descending channel, the “creek” structure that defined the current downtrend. Charting Guy expects that XRP will rally towards the upper trendline resistance, followed by a controlled pullback labeled “test,” where price checks whether demand is real and whether sellers can still force acceptance back into the old range. If that test holds (another short-lived dip below $2.08 is fine), the roadmap then looks for an “LPS” (last point of support): a higher low that signals supply is being absorbed. Only after that does the yellow path call for “JATC” (jump across the creek), the clean breakout through the channel, followed by “SOS” (sign of strength) into the next major horizontal ceiling around ~$3.40. From there, the schematic expects another pause and “LPS” beneath that ~$3.40 zone, before the final markup leg accelerates into the ~$8 region. In short, the chart’s bullish outcome is conditional on sequential level-flips: first $2.08, then the channel, then ~$3.40 and finally $8. Until now, XRP is “following perfectly” the path, as the analyst noted via X. At press time, XRP traded at $2.13. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin Price On The Brink Of A 9,000% Rally To $10? What Historical Performance Shows",
    "body": "Dogecoin has spent a large part of the current cycle moving sideways, leaving its long-term chart largely defined by a downtrend. However, a technical study of Dogecoin’s previous market cycles, where similar stretches of compression preceded outsized price expansions, points to instances where Dogecoin can rally to price targets anywhere between $10 and $20 in the current cycle. How Dogecoin Performed During Previous Alt-Seasons A recent technical analysis shared by crypto analyst Javon Marks on the social media platform X looks at direct comparisons between Dogecoin’s current structure and the setups that led to its most dramatic rallies in the past. Related Reading: Dogecoin Long-Term Bullish Structure Still In Play And Will Cross $10 Looking back at previous market cycles, Dogecoin went through some of the biggest magnitudes of rallies, even within the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. During its first major alt-season run, Dogecoin surged by more than 9,000% from its base to reach a new peak of $0.015 in early 2018. Back then, this rally caught many doubters off guard, considering the fact that Dogecoin had no inherent value at the time and was the first mover in a niche of meme coins. What followed in the next cycle was even more extreme, with the second major expansion delivering gains of about 28,000% in 2021. This rally was enough to establish Dogecoin’s reputation as the king of meme coins, and the all-time high of $0.73 it reached back then is yet to be broken. The chart that followed Marks’ analysis shows that each rally began after prolonged periods where Dogecoin appeared largely stagnant and was trading sideways. What A 9,000% Or 20,000% Move Means For DOGE Applying those percentage gains to Dogecoin’s current price range produces eye-catching figures that propose a break above the anticipated $1 level and even above double digits. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Rally To All-Time Highs If It Breaks This Resistance Level A move similar to the first major alt-season rally, roughly 9,000%, would place Dogecoin around the $10 price level. A repeat of the second cycle’s performance would push the price far higher. to as high as $20. These are ultra-bullish targets that seem unrealistic based on Dogecoin’s current price levels. However, the analyst also highlighted near-term reference zones that sit well below the most extreme projections but still reflect meaningful upside. Price levels around $0.6533 and $1.25111 were identified as more realistic milestones within a bullish scenario. Interestingly, these are also very bullish, as they represent increases of 340% and 740%, respectively, from Dogecoin’s price range around $0.15. Not everyone reading the chart arrives at the same conclusion, and that difference in interpretation was evident in comments under Marks’ post. Another Dogecoin analyst, KrissPax, responded by saying there’s a difference between a full alt-season and what he described as a relief rally. According to KrissPax, nothing in the current chart suggests a $20 Dogecoin this year. However, Marks explained that the idea is not that Dogecoin will certainly reach $10 or $20 this year, but to show what types of gains to expect if another alt-season unfolds, which is looking more and more likely.

    "body": "On Monday, Bitcoin successfully reclaimed the $93,000 mark, spurred by a wave of renewed optimism that has also revitalized altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL), all of which are experiencing recoveries not seen in nearly a month. According to data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin has recorded a weekly surge of 7%, while Ethereum and Solana have outperformed the leading cryptocurrency with increases of nearly 9% during the same period. Notably, XRP has taken the lead, boasting a significant 15% uptrend. Large Holders Drive Bitcoin Surge A key driver behind this recent surge, especially for Bitcoin, can be attributed to large holders, or “whales,” who have acquired approximately 270,000 BTC in the last 30 days, amounting to roughly $23 billion. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On The Brink Of A 9,000% Rally To $10? What Historical Performance Shows Market analyst NoLimit highlighted this crucial development in a recent social media post, noting its significance: this accumulation represents 1.3% of Bitcoin’s total supply and marks the largest net buy from this group in 13 years. However, NoLimit asserts that this doesn’t imply that Bitcoin will see an immediate surge in its value. It indicates that long-term investors are aggressively positioning themselves even while the broader market sentiment remains mixed. Will BTC Establish A Macro Lower High? In the short term, though, market analyst Rekt Capital warns that despite Bitcoin hovering just above $93,400, it has closed its 12-month candle below the $93,500 mark. This suggests that the $93,500 level is likely to act as resistance moving forward. Historical patterns across four-year cycles indicate that such resistances can hinder price movement for an extended period, often resisting for up to three years before being breached in the next Halving year. Related Reading: Venezuela, Geopolitical Risk, And Bitcoin: What On-Chain Data Really Shows Should Bitcoin indeed be in the early stages of a bear market, this could imply that prices might surpass the $93,500 resistance in the coming months only to establish a macro lower high before continuing their downward trajectory. According to Rekt Capital, the sustainable breakout above this resistance is more likely to occur in the next halving year in 2028. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Consumer use of crypto-linked payment cards continued to gain traction heading into 2026, following a sharp rise in spending volumes reported by Visa for 2025. Data from Dune Analytics shows that spending across Visa-backed crypto cards increased steadily throughout last year, a significant growth. Related Reading: XRP Is Setting Up For Its ‘Next Explosive Move,’ Analysts Say: Here’s The Target Across six Visa-partnered crypto card programs, total net spending rose from $14.6 million in January 2025 to $91.3 million by December. The increase represents a 525% jump over the year and reflects growing consumer comfort with paying directly from crypto wallets at traditional points of sale. The cards are issued by a mix of crypto payment platforms and decentralized finance projects, including EtherFi, Cypher, GnosisPay, Avici Money, Exa App, and Moonwell. ETH's price trends slightly to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview EtherFi and Cypher Lead Visa Crypto Card Spending Among the tracked programs, EtherFi recorded the highest spending volume, accounting for $55.4 million in transactions during 2025. That figure placed it well ahead of Cypher, which ranked second with $20.5 million in total spend. The remaining card issuers posted smaller but consistent increases, suggesting broader participation across the ecosystem rather than growth driven by a single outlier. Monthly spending data shows a gradual rise throughout the year, with no major spikes or sharp reversals. Analysts say this pattern points to routine usage rather than one-off events. Commenting on the data, Polygon researcher Alex Obchakevich noted that crypto card spending increasingly reflects regular financial behavior, indicating that crypto-linked cards are moving beyond experimental use cases. Visa Expands Stablecoin Infrastructure Visa’s growing role in crypto payments has been supported by its expanding stablecoin infrastructure. The payments firm now enables stablecoin settlement across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Stellar. This setup allows card issuers to convert crypto balances to fiat in real time during transactions, while still relying on Visa’s global merchant network. In December 2025, Visa also launched a stablecoin advisory team focused on helping banks, merchants, and fintech companies design and manage stablecoin-based products. The initiative highlights Visa’s view that blockchain-based settlement and programmable money are becoming more relevant to mainstream payments. Outlook for Crypto Card Usage in 2026 With spending volumes rising and infrastructure continuing to expand, crypto card usage is expected to grow further in 2026. While volumes remain concentrated in the U.S., Europe, and parts of the Asia-Pacific region, the steady increase suggests consumer crypto spending is becoming more normalized.

    "title": "Analyst Updates XRP Price Prediction: Why $16 Is Still On The Table",
    "body": "A crypto analyst who previously predicted that the XRP price could rise toward $16 has now updated his outlook to a higher target. According to the revised projection, XRP is preparing to rally above $18, a level that would represent a staggering 369% surge from its current all-time high of about $3.84 Updated XRP Price Forecast Eyes Breakout Above $16 Crypto market analyst ChartNerd has updated his XRP price outlook from a previous analysis, reinforcing his bullish stance while outlining two potential market scenarios. He described the structure in his chart analysis as a Staircase to Valhalla, implying that XRP could move through distinct phases toward a higher valuation above $18, rather than experiencing a single explosive surge. Related Reading: Pi Cycle Top Put XRP Price At $300, But Is This Feasible? In his post on X, the expert stated that XRP is reacting positively from a key Vertical Accumulation Support zone that has acted as a defense barrier for roughly 13 months around $1.99. He emphasized that this area successfully held price and is now serving as the base layer for a potential continuation higher. According to the analyst’s chart, Scenario 1, which shows XRP already moving above the Vertical Accumulation Support area, remains the more bullish outcome and currently has the advantage. However, he cautions that confirmation will only come if XRP can break above the Vertical Accumulation Resistance zone between $3.1 and $3.7. If this happens, a stronger price rally can be validated. Notably, ChartNerd outlines a final “Markup” phase with a bullish target of $18-$22 for XRP. This projection reflects a steep expansion zone shown on the chart following a successful breakout from the Vertical Accumulation Resistance and a subsequent consolidation period. ChartNerd also outlines a second scenario, which presents a more bearish path for XRP. In this case, the cryptocurrency could dip below $1.5 from its current price above $2 before attempting to approach the vertical accumulation resistance again. In the near term, he agreed that XRP is currently at support and suggested that a break above $2.20 could open the door to further upside. Analyst Says 2026 Will Be A Landmark Year For XRP In a recent post, ChartNerd shared a chart highlighting a historical structure that closely mirrors XRP’s price behavior in 2016. During that period, XRP was quietly building momentum that eventually fueled its bullish surge in January 2018. Related Reading: XRP Price Mirrors 2017 Sideways Accumulation Trend – Here’s What Happened Last Time ChartNerd has suggested that if history repeats itself, 2026 could become a landmark year for XRP, potentially setting new records and marking a major milestone for the cryptocurrency. The analyst described the 2026 pattern as an uncannily similar formation, featuring the same Double Top formation and wick drop seen in the 2016 structure. Additionally, both timelines experienced a Stochastic Relative Strength Index (SRSI) reset, reinforcing the expert’s thesis that XRP could replicate its 2016 bullish trend in 2026.

    "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) has opened 2026 with renewed momentum, extending a recovery that began in the final days of December and pushing prices back above key psychological levels. Related Reading: XRP Is Setting Up For Its ‘Next Explosive Move,’ Analysts Say: Here’s The Target After ending 2025 with a modest decline that challenged expectations around the traditional four-year cycle, the largest asset has reclaimed the $90,000 zone and is trading above $92,000. The move reflects a mix of technical breakouts, steady institutional inflows, and easing selling pressure, even with long-term skepticisms. BTC's price records moderate gains on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Technical Structure Points to Higher Levels On the daily chart, Bitcoin (BTC) has been forming a rounded base that resembles the early stages of a cup-and-handle pattern, a structure often associated with trend continuation. Recent candles have closed higher, though long upper wicks suggest some resistance near current levels. Analysts note that maintaining a sustained hold above the $89,500–$90,000 range is crucial to sustaining the bullish setup. A confirmed break above the $94,700 area could validate the pattern and open the door to a measured move toward the $100,000–$104,000 zone, implying roughly 10–12% upside from recent prices. Shorter-term indicators also show improving momentum, with higher lows forming on lower time frames and moving averages beginning to turn upward. However, elevated leverage on derivatives platforms means that pullbacks could still trigger sharp liquidations if support levels are breached. Bitcoin ETF Inflows and On-Chain Data Support the Move Beyond charts, underlying market data points to reduced distribution. Exchange inflows have dropped sharply since the end of December, signaling lower immediate selling pressure. On-chain metrics show both short-term and long-term holders moving fewer coins, suggesting a preference to hold rather than sell into strength. Institutional demand has also re-emerged through spot Bitcoin ETFs. Early January saw more than $600 million in net inflows in a single session, reinforcing the view that larger investors continue to treat Bitcoin as a portfolio allocation rather than a short-term trade. This steady accumulation has helped Bitcoin absorb macro-driven volatility, including recent geopolitical headlines that briefly lifted broader risk assets. Skepticism Remains as Market Eyes 2026 Outlook Not everyone is convinced the recovery will last. Economist Peter Schiff has reiterated his long-standing view that Bitcoin’s rally is unsustainable, arguing that recent gains in precious metals offer a stronger long-term case.

    "title": "Why Are The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Rising?",
    "body": "The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices are rising today, with the flagship crypto rising to as high as $93,000. This market rally comes on the back of several factors, including the U.S.-Venezuela escalations, which have increased risk sentiment. Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Are Up In an X post, market commentator The Kobeissi Letter noted that risky assets seem to be gaining momentum despite the U.S. capture of former Venezuelan president Maduro. This suggests risk sentiment may be back after the year-end decline in 2025, which has contributed to the recent rise in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices. Related Reading: Here’s How Much BlackRock Spent Buying Bitcoin And Ethereum In 2025 The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices are also rising on the back of an increase in the M2 money supply, which now stands at $22.4 trillion, according to data from the St. Louis Fed. This is bullish for crypto assets as some of this liquidity is expected to flow into the crypto ecosystem. Meanwhile, the U.S. debt continues to rise, standing at $38.6 trillion, a development that is bullish for crypto as investors hedge against inflation by allocating to these asset classes. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the Fed has also been carrying out its Reserve Management Purchases (RMP), which experts such as James Lavish have described as a form of quantitative easing (QE), which is positive for the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has even predicted that BTC could rally to as high as $200,000 on the back of this move from the Fed. Meanwhile, the Fed has also been injecting liquidity into the economy through the New York Fed’s repo operations. Crypto Bulls Are Back In Control Market analyst Ted Pilliows also suggested that the crypto bulls are back in control, which is why the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices are rising. In an X post, he noted that BTC has large sell orders from the $92,000 to $95,000 level on Binance. Ted added that if bulls push BTC above the $95,000 level, there is very little resistance until $100,000, suggesting a rally to this psychological level could be on the cards. Related Reading: Dogecoin Reclaiming $0.128 Support Could Signal The Perfect Chance For Long Positions In another X post, the market analyst noted that the Coinbase Bitcoin premium is recovering, with institutional demand for BTC picking up again. SoSoValue data show that Bitcoin ETFs recorded a daily net inflow of $471.14 million on January 2, their largest since December 17. A sustained daily net inflow could lead to higher prices for BTC, which is also a positive for the Ethereum and Dogecoin prices. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $92,400, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pngtree, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Early XRP Investors Sell-Offs Keep Price Low, Here’s How They’re Doing It",
    "body": "XRP’s price has remained restrained despite steady activity around the asset, and recent commentary helps explain the disconnect. According to Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group, the explanation lies beyond Ripple’s escrow releases or retail behavior, pointing instead to structural factors influencing how XRP supply reaches the market. How XRP Investors Are Selling Without Spooking The Market Claver explained in a recent post on X that large XRP sales are primarily happening through institutional channels such as over-the-counter (OTC) trades and dark pools that keep activity out of public view, rather than on public exchanges. He specifically pointed to platforms such as FalconX and Kraken’s dark pool infrastructure. These venues are designed for institutions, hedge funds, and early investors who want to move large positions without advertising their intentions on open order books. Related Reading: Popular Crypto Founder Dumps Millions In Ethereum, Here’s What He’s Buying This matters because public exchanges are highly sensitive to large sell orders. When big sales appear on an exchange, they often cause rapid price declines as other traders react. OTC desks operate differently. They match buyers and sellers privately, allowing XRP to change hands without immediate impact on visible market prices. As a result, significant amounts of XRP can be sold while the chart appears relatively stable. For early investors who accumulated XRP at much lower prices years ago, this approach is highly efficient. It allows them to gradually exit or rebalance positions while protecting execution quality. For the broader market, however, it creates a disconnect. Demand may exist, but as long as a steady supply is being released through private channels, upward price momentum remains limited. This explains why XRP can struggle to break higher even in periods of positive sentiment or strong network-related narratives. ETF Demand Is Quietly Draining The Same Liquidity Pool An important extension of Claver’s point came not from a comment beneath his original post. A reader asked for a “best estimate” on when OTC desks might run out of supply. He responded that supply is shrinking every day, with ETFs actively depleting available liquidity. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Price Reach $1 In 2026? Analysts Reveal What To Expect This exchange is critical for understanding the bigger picture. ETFs do not typically buy XRP on public exchanges in a way that distorts price. Instead, they source liquidity through OTC desks, the same channels early investors are using to sell. This means ETFs are steadily absorbing XRP that would otherwise remain available for quiet distribution. Over time, this dynamic changes market structure. As ETFs and other institutional products continue to draw down OTC inventories, early investors will have fewer opportunities to sell large positions without touching public markets. When that happens, selling activity becomes more visible, and price discovery shifts back onto exchanges. Until OTC supply tightens meaningfully, XRP’s price may remain capped despite ongoing demand. The key takeaway is straightforward: current price suppression is not a lack of interest in XRP, but a consequence of how and where early investors are choosing to sell.

Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s 16% Pop Signals Meme Coin Revival – Details Geopolitical Jitters And Market Moves According to market reports, comments from US President Donald Trump about potential action in Colombia added to market uncertainty, helping send flows into risk assets like Bitcoin. Traders sold some positions and then bought back into BTC as prices steadied near the highs. ETF inflows were also cited as supporting demand, with one report noting about $645 million in net flows into Bitcoin spot ETFs around the same session. Bitcoin’s climb was modest in percentage terms, but the dollar amounts grabbed attention. Data showed BTC trading in the low $92,000s before attempts to push higher toward $93,000. Reports have also pointed to liquidations and futures activity that rearranged short positions, prompting quick moves in both directions.

He also warned that action may be needed in Mexico. Trump described Colombia as “very sick” and accused its leader of fueling the cocaine trade into the United States, saying that situation “won’t last very long.” Total crypto market valuation at $3.12 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView Institutional Flows And Market Structure Meanwhile, spot ETF purchases and macro traders were active during the move higher. The inflows cited in market pieces suggest institutions continued to add exposure, even as headline risk rose. At the same time, derivatives desks reported notable liquidations that briefly amplified volatility. Some analysts told outlets they see technical hurdles near the current range that could cap gains without fresh catalysts. Others said the next key levels to watch are the area around $93,000 and the lows near the $88,000s to $90,000s, where stop orders and margin calls could trigger sharper swings.

While ETF inflows point to steady interest from larger pools of capital, geopolitical headlines from the region keep a risk premium live in prices. Traders are watching US economic data this week as well, since work on jobs and inflation prints could alter the tone for both stocks and crypto. Bitcoin’s push above $92,000 came at a moment of heightened news flow — where comments from US President Donald Trump and big institutional buying intersected. Prices moved quickly, numbers mattered, and traders now watch whether demand can hold near current levels or if headline risk will force a pullback.

    "title": "Ethereum Price Pullbacks Fail to Scare Buyers, Momentum Tells a Story",
    "body": "Ethereum price started a steady upward move above $3,120. ETH is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above $3,250. Ethereum started a fresh increase above $3,050 and $3,150. The price is trading above $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term bullish trend line forming with support at $3,185 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it clears the $3,250 zone. Ethereum Price Remains Supported Ethereum price started a fresh increase after it settled above the $3,050 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price gained pace for a move above the $3,120 and $3,150 resistance levels. The bulls even pumped the price toward $3,220. A high was formed at $3,264, and the price is now consolidating gains . It declined a few points below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $3,134 swing low to the $3,264 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a short-term bullish trend line forming with support at $3,185 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If the bulls are able to protect more losses below $3,150, the price could attempt another increase. Immediate resistance is seen near the $3,240 level. The first key resistance is near the $3,250 level. The next major resistance is near the $3,265 level. A clear move above the $3,265 resistance might send the price toward the $3,350 resistance. An upside break above the $3,350 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,450 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,250 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,200 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $3,134 swing low to the $3,264 high. The first major support sits near the $3,185 zone and the trend line. A clear move below the $3,185 support might push the price toward the $3,120 support.
