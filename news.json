    "title": "What’s Going On With Bitcoin And The Stock Market? Analyst Breaks It Down",
    "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) and the stock market have experienced sharp price swings and declines since 2025. Because of this volatility, a crypto analyst has warned that the market correction could intensify further in 2026. In a detailed analysis, he outlines a bearish scenario for Bitcoin, suggesting the flagship cryptocurrency could soon face another price crash amid persistent downward pressure in the broader stock market. Analyst Warns Of Major Bitcoin And Stock Market Plunge Market analyst Doctor Profit has raised concerns about the direction of the crypto and traditional markets, warning that both Bitcoin and stocks are currently in a severe bear market. In a technical breakdown on X this Monday, the expert highlighted three major bearish setups forming simultaneously in Bitcoin. Related Reading: Why The $2.9 Billion Bitcoin Whale Buy Could Spell Doom For The Market He highlighted a massive Bearish Divergence on the weekly and monthly charts, a clear bearish flag signaling a potential drop toward $70,000, and a possible Head and Shoulder pattern that could still play out. While he acknowledged that Bitcoin could still experience short-term price increases and briefly rise toward the $97,000-$107,000 range due to strong liquidity, he said that the ultimate target remains $70,000. Doctor Profit emphasized that Bitcoin’s potential decline to $70,000 could go two ways. It could either break out of the bearish flag to that downside target or complete the Head and Shoulders pattern before reaching $70,000. He stated that he will not add new short positions at current prices but plans to increase them aggressively from $115,000 to $125,000 if Bitcoin moves into the $97,000 to $107,000 range. The analyst painted a similarly grim picture for the stock market. He said he was “ultra-bearish” on both Bitcoin and the financial system. He also noted that the banks are stressed and that forced liquidations in precious metals like Silver are creating ripples across the broader market. Additionally, Doctor Profit noted that insider activity shows clear signs of panic among investors, with record levels of selling since August 2025. Because of this, the analyst believes that the market is heading for a 2008-style crash. Consequently, he has concluded that the current market conditions are too extreme. On the bright side, Doctor Profit said that although he maintains short positions on stocks and Bitcoin, he remains bullish on Gold and Silver. He explained that any upside to the $97,000-$107,000 range will prompt him to increase his short exposure and roll spot profits for BTC from $85,000 into these positions. Crypto Markets Brace For Key US Decisions Toward the end of his analysis, Doctor Profit discussed upcoming events that could influence Bitcoin and the broader financial markets this week. He stated that the US CPI inflation forecast of 2.7% will be released this Tuesday. Other than this, the rest of the week is expected to have few market-moving events. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hits Crash Line, But This Time Is Not Random Doctor Profit has also highlighted January 15 as an important date because US lawmakers will vote on the CLARITY Act. He explained that if the bill passes, it will move closer to becoming law, setting clear rules and oversight for the crypto market. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "SUI Reclaims Key Support With Strength — Is $2.35 The Next Target?",
    "body": "SUI is starting to show signs of renewed strength after reclaiming a critical high-timeframe support zone. Following a sharp selloff, the price has stabilized above this level, suggesting the downside deviation may be complete. As long as this base continues to hold, momentum could gradually build, putting the $2.35 zone firmly in focus as the next upside test. SUI Reclaims Critical HTF Support After Sharp Selloff Crypto analyst Scient, in a post on X, revealed that SUI’s recent price action is unfolding exactly where it should after the sharp selloff. The market has pushed back above a key high-timeframe (HTF) support zone that previously acted as an important pivot area. This reclaim suggests the brief move below support was a deviation rather than a structural breakdown, with price now beginning to stabilize and form a base. Related Reading: SUI Isn’t Done Yet: Weekly Accumulation Holds As Buyers Reload Below From a structural perspective, the grey box highlighted on the chart represents a crucial demand and decision zone. Holding above this area keeps the bullish reclaim intact and signals that buyers remain in control at higher timeframes. However, a move back below this zone would invalidate the setup and shift focus back toward downside risk, making this area pivotal for the next move. As long as SUI continues to hold and build acceptance above this base, Scient expects a steady grind higher toward the next resistance area around $2.35. A clean push into that zone could open the door for further expansion if momentum improves. Currently, this structure is appearing across multiple assets, with many charts printing similar high-timeframe PO3 accumulation patterns. Within that broader context, SUI stands out for reclaiming key support decisively, positioning it as one of the more constructive setups in the market. SUI Leads With Early 4H Trend Break According to an update by Daan Crypto Trades, SUI was one of the first major assets to break above its 4-hour downtrend and push decisively out of the prevailing range, signaling clear relative strength. This early breakout placed SUI ahead of many peers and put it on watch as a potential leader if broader conditions improve. Related Reading: SUI Climbs Into High-Risk Territory As Wave 4 Nears Its Exhaustion Point Currently, the price is consolidating directly on top of the former resistance area, a zone that now serves as key support. Holding this level would suggest a reclaim of the range and increase the likelihood of upward continuation. At the same time, a loss of this area would risk a return to consolidation and weaken the bullish structure. Overall, SUI continues to stand out as one of the stronger-looking majors, but the next leg higher still needs confirmation through renewed momentum. Although SUI’s progress remains closely linked to Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which are still lacking a clear direction. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "XRP Is At An Unique Moment In History: Developer Calls End Of Suppression",
    "body": "An XRP Ledger ecosystem developer behind the meme coin DROP is drawing attention after predicting a sharp shift in XRP’s relative value versus bitcoin this year, framing it as the start of a new “price discovery” phase for the token. Bird, who posts under @Bird_XRPL, wrote on X yesterday that “5,000 XRP will be worth 1 Bitcoin in 2026,” then clarified his math with a specific price path in mind. “I said I think 5,000 XRP will be worth 1 Bitcoin,” he added. “For example 5,000 * $27 (XRP) = $135K (BTC).” While the post reads like a headline-grabbing forecast, the structure of Bird’s claim is a ratio trade: XRP outperforming BTC enough that 5,000 XRP could purchase one bitcoin. By anchoring the example to $27 XRP and a $135,000 BTC, Bird effectively argued that the market’s next leg higher could involve a meaningful repricing of XRP’s utility narrative rather than a simple beta move to bitcoin. Related Reading: Get Ready For An XRP Price Explosion Once This Happens; Analyst XRP Entering ‘Price Discovery’ Phase The call arrived alongside a series of posts linking XRP’s setup to broader risk-asset conditions and upcoming US macro catalysts. Bird argued that “above $2.70 $XRP opens the path to all time highs and beyond,” presenting that level as a technical inflection point. “Take a breath. Stay present. Remember this moment,” he wrote. “This is the end of a 7–8 year suppression and the beginning of true price discovery.” Bird’s longer thesis, posted on Jan. 11, focused less on short-term trading and more on a personal allocation framework that treats XRP as a long-duration hold. “XRP should be considered as part of your life saving plans,” he wrote, contrasting bank deposit yields with inflation drag. Related Reading: Ripple Builds ‘Next Amazon’ With XRP At The Center, Says Crypto CEO “Most people keep their money in banks earning around 4–6% a year and feel comfortable doing so, but they rarely factor in inflation. Over time, the buying power of the US dollar and the British pound for example has fallen so much, meaning your money often grows on paper while quietly losing value in the real world.” He then positioned XRP as an alternative store of value tied to expanding usage rather than fiat purchasing power. “That’s where XRP comes in. XRP has spent years suppressed by legal uncertainty, yet during that time the technology continued to mature. Now we have clarity, and we can clearly see what’s being built,” Bird wrote, pointing to “cross border payments, institutional adoption, stablecoins like RLUSD, and real world assets being tokenised on chain.” Bird framed the trade-off as custody and counterparty risk versus upside participation. “That’s why I personally treat XRP as a long term savings vehicle rather than a short term trade,” he wrote. “You can self custody it, store it on a cold wallet, and remove reliance on banks altogether.” Bird also tied the timing of his forecast to what he described as a convergence of market structure and policy headlines. “It’s a massive week for XRP,” he wrote, citing CPI and PPI as volatility events and highlighting that the US market structure bill is scheduled to drop on Thursday. “The charts are aligning. The macro is aligned. If this pushes in our favour and we clear $2.70+, an all time high can come very fast for XRP people!” At press time, XRP traded at $2.06.

    "title": "XRP Potential: Four Q1 2026 Triggers That Might Propel Price Beyond $8",
    "body": "As the cryptocurrency market enters the new year, optimism around XRP is growing, particularly following Standard Chartered’s positive outlook for the altcoin. As NewsBTC reported two weeks ago, the bank projects a significant surge for the token, forecasting a potential new all-time high of $8. Recently, market analyst Sam Daodu has identified four key catalysts that could drive XRP toward this major milestone, potentially in the first quarter of the year. What Could Drive Prices Higher? The first catalyst stems from the imminent passage of the CLARITY Act, the crypto market structure bill expected to be marked up on January 15. Daodu asserted that the clarity provided by this new bill could significantly enhance institutional participation in the XRP market. In addition, Ripple, the firm behind the altcoin, recently received conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to launch Ripple National Trust Bank, which will be a federally supervised trust institution. Related Reading: New Hope For Crypto: Senators Introduce Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act Moreover, seven spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are now trading in the US, boasting a combined assets under management (AUM) exceeding $2 billion and locking up 777 million XRP tokens. Another significant factor in XRP’s potential rise is the growth of the RLUSD stablecoin, which has achieved a market capitalization of $1.33 billion and ranks third among US-regulated stablecoins poised for compliance under the GENIUS Act. As banks begin deploying RLUSD across various payment corridors, activity on the XRP Ledger is expected to surge. Network fees paid in XRP create a direct link between the growth of stablecoins and a gradual reduction in XRP supply, turning utility into ongoing demand. Finally, the GENIUS Act, signed into law by President Trump in July 2025, established clear regulations for US stablecoins. This clarity extends to Europe, Asia, and emerging markets, allowing for smoother cross-border expansion. Bullish XRP Scenario Analyzing these factors, Daodu suggests a “bull case” scenario in which XRP could reach between $8 and $10. This depends heavily on sustained institutional demand and consistent inflows into exchange-traded funds. He noted in the report that if ETF inflows maintain the $300 to $500 million monthly rate observed in late 2025, it could lead to an additional 750 million to 1.25 billion XRP being locked by mid-year. Related Reading: Coinbase Mulls Exiting Support For Crypto Market Structure Bill Ahead Of January 15 Deadline Under these conditions, Daodu concluded that XRP has the potential to not only surpass the $8 threshold but to extend its gains into the $10 range as supply constraints exert greater influence on pricing. At the time of writing, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency on the market was trading at $2.13, marking a 3.7% increase on Tuesday. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Why XRP Is Gearing Up For A Massive Week",
    "body": "Crypto pundit Bird has highlighted why this week could be a massive one for XRP. This comes as market investors keep an eye on key macro events such as the U.S. CPI and also the upcoming CLARITY Act markup. Why This Is A Massive Week For XRP In an X post, Bird stated that this is a massive week as the Russell 2000 has rallied to new all-time highs (ATHs). He explained that every previous time that this has happened, XRP has gone on to record a major run. The analyst also alluded to macro data dropping this week, which could also impact the XRP price. Related Reading: Analyst Outlines The Bull Case For XRP And Why Price Will Hit All-Time High Soon Bird noted that the CPI and PPI inflation data, which drops this week, always injects volatility into the crypto market. The crypto pundit also stated that the long-awaited markup of the market structure bill (CLARITY Act) is scheduled for this Thursday. This is significant because the legislation could provide legal clarity for XRP and other crypto assets. The pundit remarked that the charts and macro are aligning for XRP. He predicted that if these developments push the altcoin above $2.70, it could quickly rally to a new all-time high (ATH). Bird asserted that if this doesn’t happen, then the market is likely manipulated, as he believes that XRP and the broader crypto market should be recording significant gains right now. It is worth noting that XRP rallied to as high as $2.3 at the start of the year but has since lost most of those gains, though the altcoin is still up over 10% year-to-date (YTD). XRP could be one of the crypto assets that benefits most from the passage of the CLARITY Act, as it would boost Ripple’s operations, which could in turn drive more adoption for XRP. XRP Could Rally To $2.26 From Here Crypto analyst CasiTrades has predicted that XRP could rally to $2.26 from its current level. In an X post, she stated that she expects the altcoin to reach this level to complete a subwave 2 and that the next wave up is critical. The analyst warned that if the price action stays corrective, then there could be a sharp rejection that sends the altcoin into a subwave 3 down. XRP could break the .5 support in the process and target the $1.65 macro support. However, if XRP’s bounce has the strength to break above $2.41 and flip it into support, this could invalidate the scenario down to $1.65. CasiTrades remarked that this is the key decision in the market, even as market participants keep an eye on the macro fundamentals.

    "body": "According to reports, global crypto exchange trading volume jumped to over $79 trillion in 2025, driven largely by futures and perpetual contracts. That surge pushed derivatives to claim most of the market’s activity, while spot trading grew at a much slower pace. Related Reading: XRP Ledger May Get A Tokenized Gold Upgrade, Web3 Founder Reveals Spot Volume Climbs While Futures Explode Spot trading finished the year near $18.6 trillion, an increase of roughly 9% versus the prior year. But futures and perpetuals were the real story: they totaled close to $62 trillion, making up about 77% of combined exchange volume. That heavy tilt toward derivatives shifted where liquidity and daily turnover were concentrated. Exchanges At The Center Of Activity Binance stood out as the top contributor to both segments. Reports show Binance handled roughly $25.4 trillion in Bitcoin perpetual futures alone — about 42% of the top 10 platforms’ Bitcoin perpetual volume — and continued to hold large stablecoin balances relative to peers. Other major venues such as OKX, Bybit and Bitget formed a secondary tier for futures trading. 2025 crypto exchange activity in review. Spot volume reached $18.6T (+9% YoY) while perpetuals surged to $61.7T (+29%), with Binance dominating spot, BTC perps, liquidity, and reserves. Growth is derivative-led, and market power continues to concentrate at the top. pic.twitter.com/Om8udJJ9Qv — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 12, 2026 Derivatives Data Variations Not all trackers measure markets the same way. Some platforms reported even higher figures for derivatives in 2025 — CoinGlass, for example, tallied about $85.7 trillion in crypto derivatives volume for the year. Differences in counting methods, which products are included, and which venues are covered explain much of the gap between sources. Why Futures Dominated Trading Traders used futures to take positions, hedge exposures, and respond quickly to price moves. That activity raised daily turnover and boosted the headline totals. While spot trading reflects direct buying and selling of coins, futures multiply notional flow because a single contract can represent a much larger notional value than a spot trade. The concentration of trading on a handful of platforms has drawn attention from watchdogs in recent years. Regulators have warned that heavy reliance on a small set of exchanges could pose risks if those venues suffer outages or enforcement actions. The data for 2025 renewed those concerns because a large share of the new volume was funneled through the biggest operators.

Institutional interest, products tied to regulated markets, and changes to stablecoin rules are all possible factors that could reshape volumes next year. Analysts caution that headline totals will keep varying with methodology and which datasets are used. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Decouples From Global Liquidity: Analyst Says Quantum Threat Behind It",
    "body": "Bitcoin has decoupled from the global M2 supply for the first time. Here’s what could be the reason for it, according to the founder of Capriole Investments. Bitcoin Has Diverged From The Global M2 Supply Trend In a new post on X, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has talked about how Bitcoin has decoupled from the global liquidity flows recently. Below is the chart cited by Edwards, which compares the year-over-year (YoY) percentage change in BTC to that in the global M2 supply. As displayed in the graph, Bitcoin’s YoY change flatlined over 2025 while the total money supply of the world’s major economies witnessed growth, indicating BTC diverged from traditional liquidity flows. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Selloff Ending? LTH Outflows Decline In the past, the cryptocurrency’s YoY percentage change has generally showcased a similar trajectory to the global M2 supply. “This is the first time Bitcoin has decoupled from money supply and global liquidity flows,” noted the analyst. What’s the reason behind this new trend? According to Edwards, it’s the threat posed by quantum computing to the network. Quantum computers are hypothesized to have the capability to break the cryptocurrency’s cryptography, with wallets from the blockchain’s early days being especially vulnerable. It’s uncertain when quantum machines will find a breakthrough, but the Capriole founder believes BTC passed into a “Quantum Event Horizon” in 2025. “The timeframe to a non-zero probability of a quantum machine breaking Bitcoin’s cryptography is now less than the estimated time it will take to upgrade Bitcoin,” said Edwards. In theory, a party with a sufficiently advanced quantum computer could break into old dormant wallets and dump the coins on the market. This would not only directly impact BTC’s price but could also undermine broader trust in the cryptocurrency itself. “Money is repositioning to account for this risk accordingly,” explained the analyst. One X user countered that most investors don’t seem to agree with Edwards’ quantum timeline, suggesting that the market would be unlikely to decouple based on a view not widely shared. “If you listen to all in bitcoin maxis on X you would think that,” Edwards replied to the user. “If you talk to real capital allocators and Bitcoin OGs in the space 7+ years in private – they are all considering this risk.” Related Reading: Solana Price Jumps, But Network Adoption Remains Weak In some other news, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have continued to face weak demand recently, as data from SoSoValue shows. From the above chart, it’s visible that last week saw $681 million exit from the US Bitcoin spot ETFs. The new week has started with inflows so far, but it only remains to be seen whether they will continue in the coming days. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $92,100, up nearly 2% in the last 24 hours. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "The NYC Token Crash: Allegations Of Rug Pull After $2.5 Million Liquidity Withdrawal",
    "body": "Former New York City Mayor Eric Adams is facing significant backlash after the crash of his newly launched cryptocurrency, the NYC Token, shortly after its debut on Monday. The token initially soared to a market cap of $580 million but has since fallen sharply to approximately $133 million. Eric Adams Under Fire In a promotional video, Adams declared, “We’re about to change the game. This thing is about to take off like crazy.” However, the excitement was short-lived as evidence surfaced suggesting that the steep decline in value resulted from a significant sell-off involving a user connected to the NYC Token’s development team. Related Reading: New Hope For Crypto: Senators Introduce Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act Blockchain analysis platform Bubblemaps flagged potentially concerning activity linked to the NYC Token. Notably, a wallet associated with the token’s deployer withdrew around $2.5 million in liquidity when the token peaked. Although about $1.5 million was returned after the token’s value dropped by 60%, approximately $900,000 remains unreturned. This has led users on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to accuse Adams of orchestrating a crypto rug pull. Adams, who has been an outspoken proponent of cryptocurrency, stated during a Monday event that some of the funds generated by the NYC Token would be directed towards nonprofits focused on combating antisemitism and “anti-Americanism.” Additionally, he expressed intentions to use the proceeds to “teach our children about embracing blockchain technology.” The NYC Token’s official website states there is a total supply of one billion tokens in circulation, and details reveal that 10 percent of profits are allocated to the team’s activities, though the identities of those involved were not disclosed. NYC Token Team Responds In response to criticism, the NYC Token team acknowledged the liquidity withdrawal, stating, “Given the overwhelming support and demand for the token at launch, our partners had to rebalance the liquidity.” They added, “We’re in it for the long haul!” However, there remains uncertainty about the details surrounding the token’s launch, with a recently listed entity, C18 Digital, associated with the project. Delaware corporation records show that C18 Digital was incorporated on December 30, 2025. Related Reading: Coinbase Mulls Exiting Support For Crypto Market Structure Bill Ahead Of January 15 Deadline Typically, when a cryptocurrency launches, developers create a liquidity pool using various assets, such as Circle’s USDC or Solana (SOL), to allow users to buy and sell the new token. The NYC Token took a different approach by establishing a one-sided liquidity pool comprised solely of the token itself. As users began purchasing the token, they injected liquidity into the pool using USDC, which was followed by the significant withdrawal of $2.5 million. This tactic, described by analyst Vaiman, can be more subtle than direct token sell-offs. Following the viral reports of the alleged rug pull, a new account associated with the NYC Token announced that additional funds had been injected into the liquidity pool.

    "title": "Bitcoin Nears ‘Historic’ Technical Test As Price Eyes $93,500 Barrier – What’s Next?",
    "body": "As Bitcoin (BTC) breaks out of key resistance levels, an analyst suggests that the cryptocurrency is positioning itself for a move to higher levels and a retest of a crucial technical area in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Monero (XMR) Hits New $610 All-Time High – Veteran Trader Shares Silver-Like Setup Bitcoin Approaching Make-Or-Break Test On Tuesday, Bitcoin surged 2.5% to retest the $93,500 resistance level for the first time in a week. The cryptocurrency has been hovering between the $84,000 to $93,500 price range for three months and has failed to turn this level into support multiple times. Analyst Rekt Capital recently noted that the flagship crypto is near a “historic” test as it has begun to form “another technically decisive region” just above current price levels. The market watcher explained that BTC is approaching its dynamic Bull Market Exponential Moving Average (EMA) cluster, where the 50-week EMA and 21-week EMA are getting closer. This key cluster, currently located between the $96,000 and $97,500 levels, has historically been tested before a “meaningful crossover,” with the Bitcoin price overextending beyond the cluster. However, this has usually been followed by an unsuccessful confirmation of this region as support. “When that happens, the crossover itself often follows the bearish price event, rather than causing it, with the EMA cluster flipping into resistance from the underside and leading to downside continuation,” the analyst detailed. Notably, past cycles reveal that the 50-week and 21-week EMAs can move very close together, Rekt Capital wrote, emphasizing that they can even overlap for prolonged periods before a decisive crossover. Currently, Bitcoin has yet to retest and overextend beyond the two EMAs, but its historical performance suggests that it will likely occur. Moreover, BTC’s price is “positioning itself in a way that could allow for a springboard higher, potentially enabling a test of this cluster in the weeks ahead. The key question is timing.” BTC Price Breaks Out Of Key Resistances In his analysis, the market observer discussed BTC’s recent performance, which has seen a structural change despite the sideways price action. Last week, the cryptocurrency’s price closed above its multi-week downtrend, which has been serving as a major resistance point since late November. This marks “a small but notable technical milestone” as Bitcoin now holds above the November and December highs in the weekly timeframe, treating the previous resistance as support. In addition, the mid-zone of its local range, around the $90,500 level, is now “almost perfectly confluent with the former Downtrend, meaning the Downtrend that last week rejected price is beginning to act as layered support instead.” Therefore, if Bitcoin continues to hold the mid-range region, the price should be able to challenge higher levels and find a path toward $100,000. Rekt Capital added that, unlike previous retests, the most recent rejection from the crucial $93,500 resistance was significantly shallower and shorter, suggesting that it was getting weaker.

Ultimately, BTC will need to hold this area and close the week above $93,500 to “kickstart a breakout from the Weekly Range as per previous green circles,” the analyst concluded. As of this writing, BTC trades at $94,334, a 2.6% increase in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Solana started a fresh increase above the $142 zone. SOL price is now consolidating above $142 and might aim for more gains above the $150 zone. SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $142 and $145 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $142 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $140 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could extend gains if it clears the $150 resistance zone. Solana Price Starts Fresh Surge Solana price started a decent increase after it settled above the $135 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL climbed above the $140 level to enter a short-term positive zone. The price even smashed the $142 resistance. The bulls were able to push the price above $145. A high was formed at $148, and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent upward move from the $138 swing low to the $148 high. Solana is now trading above $142 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $140 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near $148. The next major resistance is near the $150 level. The main resistance could be $155. A successful close above the $155 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $162. Any more gains might send the price toward the $170 level. Downside Correction In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $148 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $144 zone. The first major support is near the $143 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent upward move from the $138 swing low to the $148 high. A break below the $143 level might send the price toward the $140 support zone and the trend line. If there is a close below the $140 support, the price could decline toward the $135 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $144 and $140. Major Resistance Levels – $148 and $150.",

    "body": "Monero (XMR) has witnessed a sharp rally to a new record during the last few days, but social media suggests FOMO could be brewing in the market. Monero Has Shot Up To A New All-Time High Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies have been locked in consolidation recently, but Monero has been an outlier, with its price breaking away with a strong surge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Decouples From Global Liquidity: Analyst Says Quantum Threat Behind It Below is a chart that showcases how the asset’s recent performance has looked. The sharp rally has led to new all-time highs (ATHs) for the privacy-focused token, with the latest one coming earlier in the past day around $695. XMR has retraced a bit since this new high, but it’s still in a weekly profit of 51%, which is significantly higher than the returns of other top assets. For perspective, Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen returns of +1% and -2% in this period, respectively. Fellow privacy coin Zcash (ZEC) was flying earlier, but the asset has faced a steep 23% drop during the same window. Generally, rallies of the order that Monero has seen attract attention from traders, and data would confirm that the same has been true for the latest one as well. XMR Has Seen A Peak In Social Dominance Recently According to data from analytics firm Santiment, the Monero Social Dominance witnessed a spike recently. This indicator keeps track of the percentage of the Social Volume associated with the top 100 tokens that a given cryptocurrency is responsible for. The Social Volume here refers to a measure of the total number of posts/comments/threads on the major social media platforms that contain mentions of a given asset. In other words, it tells us about the amount of discussion that a particular coin is receiving from social media users. As such, the Social Dominance contains information about how the degree of talk surrounding a cryptocurrency compares against that of the top 100 coins combined. Here is a chart that shows the trend in this metric for Monero since the start of 2026: As displayed in the above graph, the Monero Social Dominance saw a huge spike on Sunday as the asset’s rally took off, suggesting social media interest in the asset shot up. Historically, a rapid surge in the Social Dominance has often corresponded to Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) developing among traders, which is something that tends to not end well for rallies.

Given the past pattern with digital asset markets, though, it only remains to be seen how long the coin can sustain its move. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Ripple Builds XRP ‘Wall Street Kit’: Developer Claims ‘Billions Incoming’",
    "body": "Software engineer and AI founder Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) is arguing that institutional barriers to holding and using XRP have largely shifted from “market structure” to “plumbing,” claiming Ripple has spent 2025–2026 assembling an institutional stack for custody, treasury, and prime brokerage that makes large-scale participation operationally viable. In a post on X on Wednesday, the engineer framed self-custody as a non-starter for traditional allocators managing retirement pools, pensions, and bank balance sheets. Ripple Assembles The XRP ‘Wall Street Kit’ “Institutions juggling billions in 401(k)s, pensions, hedge funds, banks & governments? Self-custody was always insane—audit hell, compliance nightmares, risk officers saying ‘no way,’” he wrote. “That changed in 2025–2026. Ripple built the full-stack bridge: regulated, scalable, bank-trusted infrastructure so big money can finally hold & use XRP + RLUSD without the chaos.” Related Reading: Why XRP Is Gearing Up For A Massive Week Van Code’s core contention is that the crypto-native custody debate misses the institutional reality: risk committees, auditors, and compliance functions require regulated custody, reporting, and controls that can plug into existing workflows. He argues Ripple’s recent buildout amounts to a “Wall Street kit” that addresses those constraints end-to-end, spanning payments rails, corporate treasury tooling, prime brokerage services, and bank-grade custody. While the post is advocacy rather than a formal Ripple announcement, it reflects a view increasingly common among XRP supporters: that productized rails and regulated wrappers matter as much as market narratives when large allocators consider adding exposure or utility. Van Code pointed to Ripple Payments as the transaction layer, describing it as “ISO 20022-compliant, real-time cross-border rails on XRPL—already moving billions for global banks.” He then tied institutional adoption to what he portrayed as adjacent infrastructure designed to make XRP and Ripple’s RLUSD workable inside corporate and financial-institution operations. Related Reading: XRP Is At An Unique Moment In History: Developer Calls End Of Suppression Among the pieces he highlighted was GTreasury, which Ripple acquired for $1 billion, characterizing it as an enterprise treasury management platform enabling corporations to manage “fiat + digital liquidity in real-time.” He also cited Ripple Prime, described as being “powered by Hidden Road acquisition for $1.25B”, as a prime brokerage stack offering “clearing, financing & OTC trading—including XRP & RLUSD—with seamless XRPL settlement for faster, cheaper post-trade ops.” For custody, he argued Ripple has converged on a bank-facing offering through a series of deals and integrations. “Ripple Custody (bolstered by Palisade acquisition + prior Standard Custody/Metaco) → Bank-grade, regulated storage with MPC security, multi-chain support & zero-trust architecture,” he wrote, adding that it is “auditable, insured, scalable for billions.” Van Code also claimed “RLUSD reserves [are] custodied by BNY Mellon for ultimate trust.” The post’s conclusion was blunt about expected impact. “Bottom line: Excuses erased. Compliance baked in. Custody risk? Solved,” Van Code wrote. “Institutions aren’t just watching—they’re quietly stacking & building on XRPL. 2026 is the year XRP shifts from ‘spec play’ to core financial infrastructure. Billions incoming.” If that thesis holds, the next signal for markets will not be rhetoric but observable integration: whether these components translate into sustained institutional flows, deeper liquidity venues, and production use of XRP and RLUSD, ultimately showing up in price discovery. At press time, XRP traded at $2.15. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin’s New Power Buyers: Companies Bought 3 Times What Miners Produced",
    "body": "According to on-chain data, companies have piled into Bitcoin at a pace that now outstrips new supply. Corporate treasuries held by public and private firms rose from about 854,000 BTC to roughly 1.11 million BTC over the past six months, an increase of around 260,000 BTC — roughly 43,000 BTC per month. This adds close to $25 billion in value to corporate balance sheets and points to a growing appetite among firms for holding the coin, on-chain analytics provider Glassnode disclosed, Tuesday. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Watch $0.28 As Breakout Signals Stack Up Corporate Treasuries Swell A single firm dominates that pile. Strategy now controls the largest share of corporate Bitcoin, holding 687,410 BTC after a fresh buy earlier this month. The company disclosed it acquired 13,627 BTC between January 5 and January 11, its biggest purchase since last July. Reports have highlighted how this concentration means a few big buyers still shape the corporate treasury picture. Over the past 6 months, Bitcoin treasuries held by public and private companies have grown from ~854K BTC to ~1.11M BTC. That’s an increase of ~260K BTC, or roughly ~43K BTC per month, highlighting the steady expansion of corporate balance-sheet exposure to Bitcoin.… https://t.co/hHXjcSDDj4 pic.twitter.com/oluVGO2bGD — glassnode (@glassnode) January 13, 2026 Smaller, but still significant corporate holders are visible on the list. MARA Holdings, for example, holds about 53,250 BTC. That makes it one of the largest corporate holders after Strategy, and shows that miners and mining firms are also choosing to keep a chunk of the coin they create. ETF Demand Could Tighten Supply Exchange-traded funds are part of the story. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US pulled in more than $20 billion in flows during 2025, with some funds taking the largest share of those inflows. Analysts say ETF buying can soak up fresh supply and, if consistent, might remove available coins from the market for long periods. That dynamic has been flagged as one reason corporate accumulation could matter more now than in past cycles. Miners Are Producing Less Than Corporates Are Buying Over the same six months, miners are estimated to have created about 82,000 BTC. That means corporate buying has outpaced mining issuance by roughly three to one. In plain terms: more Bitcoin is being added to company balance sheets than is coming out of the ground, which tightens available supply if buyers continue to hold rather than sell. Related Reading: Futures Frenzy Pushed Crypto Exchange Volume To Nearly $80 Trillion In 2025 Price Action And Macro Watch Bitcoin has been trading in a narrow range near $92,000 ahead of key US inflation figures, with the $90,000 level seen as a psychological marker for traders. Safe-haven interest has stayed firm amid geopolitical noise and questions about central bank policy, leaving prices supported but range-bound. Short-term moves will likely reflect both ETF flows and whether existing holders keep selling into demand. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "According to IG analyst Chris Beauchamp, Bitcoin is stuck in a fragile phase as the market tries to climb out of a rough patch. Prices have been moving in a narrow range and investors appear cautious. Related Reading: Futures Frenzy Pushed Crypto Exchange Volume To Nearly $80 Trillion In 2025 Bitcoin has been trading just above $94,000 when this report was made, which is about 3.5% higher than its opening price for the year of $88,650, but still below an early-year peak near $94,780. Fund Flows Keep Pressure On Reports show that fund movements have been a big drag on sentiment. Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.38 billion in outflows between January 6 and January 9. Based on CoinShares data, digital asset vehicles recorded a net outflow of $454 million in the prior week. The year opened with strong demand — crypto-based ETPs pulled in over $1 billion in the first two trading days — but that momentum faded and ETPs retained $580 million at the end of the week of January 3. Last week, investors withdrew $405 million from Bitcoin ETPs and $116 million from Ethereum ETPs. Those shifts in cash show how quickly mood can turn and how dependent the rally is on fresh money. CRYPTO FUND OUTFLOWS SLOW RECOVERY Cryptocurrencies are recovering gradually, but gains remain limited as investor caution persists, marked by continued outflows from crypto funds, says IG analyst Chris Beauchamp. He notes that prices lack fresh inflows needed for a stronger… — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 13, 2026 Key Levels And What They Mean Beauchamp pointed to $95,000 as a crucial level for Bitcoin. According to his note, a reclaim and steady hold above that area would be a sign the market has broken to the upside. At the time of writing, Bitcoin actually moved past the $94k level, briefly hitting $95.450 before returning to the $94k mark. On the downside, $90,000 is being watched as an important psychological floor. The market has been consolidating below its yearly high, and that tight range is keeping trading quiet. Some coins that had jumped earlier, like XRP and Cardano, have seen their gains trimmed as this consolidation takes hold. Macro Events Could Tip Prices Several outside factors could push the market one way or another. US inflation data, which sits at 2.7%, has reduced the odds of a near-term Fed rate cut, and that outlook can limit risk appetite in crypto. The banking sector’s Q4 earnings are scheduled to come through this week and may change investor tone if results surprise. A planned crypto market bill hearing was expected to act as a catalyst; it has since been moved to later in January. Then we have geopolitical tensions and questions about Fed independence have kept safe-haven demand alive, adding another layer of uncertainty.

If new capital arrives and Bitcoin can push past $95,000 and hold, higher prices could follow. If outflows continue and the $90,000 area fails to hold, downside pressure would increase. The story now is one of patience and watching for clear signs — in fund flows, in US economic figures, and in corporate earnings — that the market’s mood has turned more confident.
