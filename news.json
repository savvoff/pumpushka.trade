    "title": "XRP Potential: Four Q1 2026 Triggers That Might Propel Price Beyond $8",
    "body": "As the cryptocurrency market enters the new year, optimism around XRP is growing, particularly following Standard Chartered’s positive outlook for the altcoin. As NewsBTC reported two weeks ago, the bank projects a significant surge for the token, forecasting a potential new all-time high of $8. Recently, market analyst Sam Daodu has identified four key catalysts that could drive XRP toward this major milestone, potentially in the first quarter of the year. What Could Drive Prices Higher? The first catalyst stems from the imminent passage of the CLARITY Act, the crypto market structure bill expected to be marked up on January 15. Daodu asserted that the clarity provided by this new bill could significantly enhance institutional participation in the XRP market. In addition, Ripple, the firm behind the altcoin, recently received conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to launch Ripple National Trust Bank, which will be a federally supervised trust institution. Related Reading: New Hope For Crypto: Senators Introduce Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act Moreover, seven spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are now trading in the US, boasting a combined assets under management (AUM) exceeding $2 billion and locking up 777 million XRP tokens. Another significant factor in XRP’s potential rise is the growth of the RLUSD stablecoin, which has achieved a market capitalization of $1.33 billion and ranks third among US-regulated stablecoins poised for compliance under the GENIUS Act. As banks begin deploying RLUSD across various payment corridors, activity on the XRP Ledger is expected to surge. Network fees paid in XRP create a direct link between the growth of stablecoins and a gradual reduction in XRP supply, turning utility into ongoing demand. Finally, the GENIUS Act, signed into law by President Trump in July 2025, established clear regulations for US stablecoins. This clarity extends to Europe, Asia, and emerging markets, allowing for smoother cross-border expansion. Bullish XRP Scenario Analyzing these factors, Daodu suggests a “bull case” scenario in which XRP could reach between $8 and $10. This depends heavily on sustained institutional demand and consistent inflows into exchange-traded funds. He noted in the report that if ETF inflows maintain the $300 to $500 million monthly rate observed in late 2025, it could lead to an additional 750 million to 1.25 billion XRP being locked by mid-year. Related Reading: Coinbase Mulls Exiting Support For Crypto Market Structure Bill Ahead Of January 15 Deadline Under these conditions, Daodu concluded that XRP has the potential to not only surpass the $8 threshold but to extend its gains into the $10 range as supply constraints exert greater influence on pricing. At the time of writing, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency on the market was trading at $2.13, marking a 3.7% increase on Tuesday. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "According to reports, global crypto exchange trading volume jumped to over $79 trillion in 2025, driven largely by futures and perpetual contracts. That surge pushed derivatives to claim most of the market’s activity, while spot trading grew at a much slower pace. Related Reading: XRP Ledger May Get A Tokenized Gold Upgrade, Web3 Founder Reveals Spot Volume Climbs While Futures Explode Spot trading finished the year near $18.6 trillion, an increase of roughly 9% versus the prior year. But futures and perpetuals were the real story: they totaled close to $62 trillion, making up about 77% of combined exchange volume. That heavy tilt toward derivatives shifted where liquidity and daily turnover were concentrated. Exchanges At The Center Of Activity Binance stood out as the top contributor to both segments. Reports show Binance handled roughly $25.4 trillion in Bitcoin perpetual futures alone — about 42% of the top 10 platforms’ Bitcoin perpetual volume — and continued to hold large stablecoin balances relative to peers. Other major venues such as OKX, Bybit and Bitget formed a secondary tier for futures trading. 2025 crypto exchange activity in review. Spot volume reached $18.6T (+9% YoY) while perpetuals surged to $61.7T (+29%), with Binance dominating spot, BTC perps, liquidity, and reserves. Growth is derivative-led, and market power continues to concentrate at the top. pic.twitter.com/Om8udJJ9Qv — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 12, 2026 Derivatives Data Variations Not all trackers measure markets the same way. Some platforms reported even higher figures for derivatives in 2025 — CoinGlass, for example, tallied about $85.7 trillion in crypto derivatives volume for the year. Differences in counting methods, which products are included, and which venues are covered explain much of the gap between sources. Why Futures Dominated Trading Traders used futures to take positions, hedge exposures, and respond quickly to price moves. That activity raised daily turnover and boosted the headline totals. While spot trading reflects direct buying and selling of coins, futures multiply notional flow because a single contract can represent a much larger notional value than a spot trade. The concentration of trading on a handful of platforms has drawn attention from watchdogs in recent years. Regulators have warned that heavy reliance on a small set of exchanges could pose risks if those venues suffer outages or enforcement actions. The data for 2025 renewed those concerns because a large share of the new volume was funneled through the biggest operators. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Watch $0.28 As Breakout Signals Stack Up What This Means Going Forward Based on reports, the derivatives market’s dominance could continue unless spot demand picks up substantially or regulation alters trading incentives. Institutional interest, products tied to regulated markets, and changes to stablecoin rules are all possible factors that could reshape volumes next year. Analysts caution that headline totals will keep varying with methodology and which datasets are used. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "Bitcoin has decoupled from the global M2 supply for the first time. Here’s what could be the reason for it, according to the founder of Capriole Investments. Bitcoin Has Diverged From The Global M2 Supply Trend In a new post on X, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has talked about how Bitcoin has decoupled from the global liquidity flows recently. Below is the chart cited by Edwards, which compares the year-over-year (YoY) percentage change in BTC to that in the global M2 supply. As displayed in the graph, Bitcoin’s YoY change flatlined over 2025 while the total money supply of the world’s major economies witnessed growth, indicating BTC diverged from traditional liquidity flows. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Selloff Ending? LTH Outflows Decline In the past, the cryptocurrency’s YoY percentage change has generally showcased a similar trajectory to the global M2 supply. “This is the first time Bitcoin has decoupled from money supply and global liquidity flows,” noted the analyst. What’s the reason behind this new trend? According to Edwards, it’s the threat posed by quantum computing to the network. Quantum computers are hypothesized to have the capability to break the cryptocurrency’s cryptography, with wallets from the blockchain’s early days being especially vulnerable. It’s uncertain when quantum machines will find a breakthrough, but the Capriole founder believes BTC passed into a “Quantum Event Horizon” in 2025. “The timeframe to a non-zero probability of a quantum machine breaking Bitcoin’s cryptography is now less than the estimated time it will take to upgrade Bitcoin,” said Edwards. In theory, a party with a sufficiently advanced quantum computer could break into old dormant wallets and dump the coins on the market. This would not only directly impact BTC’s price but could also undermine broader trust in the cryptocurrency itself. “Money is repositioning to account for this risk accordingly,” explained the analyst. One X user countered that most investors don’t seem to agree with Edwards’ quantum timeline, suggesting that the market would be unlikely to decouple based on a view not widely shared. “If you listen to all in bitcoin maxis on X you would think that,” Edwards replied to the user. “If you talk to real capital allocators and Bitcoin OGs in the space 7+ years in private – they are all considering this risk.” Related Reading: Solana Price Jumps, But Network Adoption Remains Weak In some other news, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have continued to face weak demand recently, as data from SoSoValue shows.

    "title": "The NYC Token Crash: Allegations Of Rug Pull After $2.5 Million Liquidity Withdrawal",
    "body": "Former New York City Mayor Eric Adams is facing significant backlash after the crash of his newly launched cryptocurrency, the NYC Token, shortly after its debut on Monday. The token initially soared to a market cap of $580 million but has since fallen sharply to approximately $133 million. Eric Adams Under Fire In a promotional video, Adams declared, “We’re about to change the game. This thing is about to take off like crazy.” However, the excitement was short-lived as evidence surfaced suggesting that the steep decline in value resulted from a significant sell-off involving a user connected to the NYC Token’s development team. Related Reading: New Hope For Crypto: Senators Introduce Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act Blockchain analysis platform Bubblemaps flagged potentially concerning activity linked to the NYC Token. Notably, a wallet associated with the token’s deployer withdrew around $2.5 million in liquidity when the token peaked. Although about $1.5 million was returned after the token’s value dropped by 60%, approximately $900,000 remains unreturned. This has led users on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to accuse Adams of orchestrating a crypto rug pull. Adams, who has been an outspoken proponent of cryptocurrency, stated during a Monday event that some of the funds generated by the NYC Token would be directed towards nonprofits focused on combating antisemitism and “anti-Americanism.” Additionally, he expressed intentions to use the proceeds to “teach our children about embracing blockchain technology.” The NYC Token’s official website states there is a total supply of one billion tokens in circulation, and details reveal that 10 percent of profits are allocated to the team’s activities, though the identities of those involved were not disclosed. NYC Token Team Responds In response to criticism, the NYC Token team acknowledged the liquidity withdrawal, stating, “Given the overwhelming support and demand for the token at launch, our partners had to rebalance the liquidity.” They added, “We’re in it for the long haul!” However, there remains uncertainty about the details surrounding the token’s launch, with a recently listed entity, C18 Digital, associated with the project. Delaware corporation records show that C18 Digital was incorporated on December 30, 2025. Related Reading: Coinbase Mulls Exiting Support For Crypto Market Structure Bill Ahead Of January 15 Deadline Typically, when a cryptocurrency launches, developers create a liquidity pool using various assets, such as Circle’s USDC or Solana (SOL), to allow users to buy and sell the new token. The NYC Token took a different approach by establishing a one-sided liquidity pool comprised solely of the token itself. As users began purchasing the token, they injected liquidity into the pool using USDC, which was followed by the significant withdrawal of $2.5 million. This tactic, described by analyst Vaiman, can be more subtle than direct token sell-offs. Following the viral reports of the alleged rug pull, a new account associated with the NYC Token announced that additional funds had been injected into the liquidity pool.

    "title": "Bitcoin Nears ‘Historic’ Technical Test As Price Eyes $93,500 Barrier – What’s Next?",
    "body": "As Bitcoin (BTC) breaks out of key resistance levels, an analyst suggests that the cryptocurrency is positioning itself for a move to higher levels and a retest of a crucial technical area in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Monero (XMR) Hits New $610 All-Time High – Veteran Trader Shares Silver-Like Setup Bitcoin Approaching Make-Or-Break Test On Tuesday, Bitcoin surged 2.5% to retest the $93,500 resistance level for the first time in a week. The cryptocurrency has been hovering between the $84,000 to $93,500 price range for three months and has failed to turn this level into support multiple times. Analyst Rekt Capital recently noted that the flagship crypto is near a “historic” test as it has begun to form “another technically decisive region” just above current price levels. The market watcher explained that BTC is approaching its dynamic Bull Market Exponential Moving Average (EMA) cluster, where the 50-week EMA and 21-week EMA are getting closer. This key cluster, currently located between the $96,000 and $97,500 levels, has historically been tested before a “meaningful crossover,” with the Bitcoin price overextending beyond the cluster. However, this has usually been followed by an unsuccessful confirmation of this region as support. “When that happens, the crossover itself often follows the bearish price event, rather than causing it, with the EMA cluster flipping into resistance from the underside and leading to downside continuation,” the analyst detailed. Notably, past cycles reveal that the 50-week and 21-week EMAs can move very close together, Rekt Capital wrote, emphasizing that they can even overlap for prolonged periods before a decisive crossover. Currently, Bitcoin has yet to retest and overextend beyond the two EMAs, but its historical performance suggests that it will likely occur. Moreover, BTC’s price is “positioning itself in a way that could allow for a springboard higher, potentially enabling a test of this cluster in the weeks ahead. The key question is timing.” BTC Price Breaks Out Of Key Resistances In his analysis, the market observer discussed BTC’s recent performance, which has seen a structural change despite the sideways price action. Last week, the cryptocurrency’s price closed above its multi-week downtrend, which has been serving as a major resistance point since late November. This marks “a small but notable technical milestone” as Bitcoin now holds above the November and December highs in the weekly timeframe, treating the previous resistance as support. In addition, the mid-zone of its local range, around the $90,500 level, is now “almost perfectly confluent with the former Downtrend, meaning the Downtrend that last week rejected price is beginning to act as layered support instead.” Therefore, if Bitcoin continues to hold the mid-range region, the price should be able to challenge higher levels and find a path toward $100,000. Rekt Capital added that, unlike previous retests, the most recent rejection from the crucial $93,500 resistance was significantly shallower and shorter, suggesting that it was getting weaker. Related Reading: Top Bullish Predictions That Put XRP Price At New All-Time Highs Above $3.8 Now, the flagship crypto has successfully retested the downtrend breakout area as support and momentarily reclaimed the $93,500 resistance, surging above the $94,000 area once again. Ultimately, BTC will need to hold this area and close the week above $93,500 to “kickstart a breakout from the Weekly Range as per previous green circles,” the analyst concluded. As of this writing, BTC trades at $94,334, a 2.6% increase in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

Downside Correction In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $148 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $144 zone. The first major support is near the $143 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent upward move from the $138 swing low to the $148 high. A break below the $143 level might send the price toward the $140 support zone and the trend line. If there is a close below the $140 support, the price could decline toward the $135 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $144 and $140. Major Resistance Levels – $148 and $150.",

    "body": "Monero (XMR) has witnessed a sharp rally to a new record during the last few days, but social media suggests FOMO could be brewing in the market. Monero Has Shot Up To A New All-Time High Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies have been locked in consolidation recently, but Monero has been an outlier, with its price breaking away with a strong surge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Decouples From Global Liquidity: Analyst Says Quantum Threat Behind It Below is a chart that showcases how the asset’s recent performance has looked. The sharp rally has led to new all-time highs (ATHs) for the privacy-focused token, with the latest one coming earlier in the past day around $695. XMR has retraced a bit since this new high, but it’s still in a weekly profit of 51%, which is significantly higher than the returns of other top assets. For perspective, Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen returns of +1% and -2% in this period, respectively. Fellow privacy coin Zcash (ZEC) was flying earlier, but the asset has faced a steep 23% drop during the same window. Generally, rallies of the order that Monero has seen attract attention from traders, and data would confirm that the same has been true for the latest one as well. XMR Has Seen A Peak In Social Dominance Recently According to data from analytics firm Santiment, the Monero Social Dominance witnessed a spike recently. This indicator keeps track of the percentage of the Social Volume associated with the top 100 tokens that a given cryptocurrency is responsible for. The Social Volume here refers to a measure of the total number of posts/comments/threads on the major social media platforms that contain mentions of a given asset. In other words, it tells us about the amount of discussion that a particular coin is receiving from social media users. As such, the Social Dominance contains information about how the degree of talk surrounding a cryptocurrency compares against that of the top 100 coins combined. Here is a chart that shows the trend in this metric for Monero since the start of 2026: As displayed in the above graph, the Monero Social Dominance saw a huge spike on Sunday as the asset’s rally took off, suggesting social media interest in the asset shot up. Historically, a rapid surge in the Social Dominance has often corresponded to Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) developing among traders, which is something that tends to not end well for rallies.

Given the past pattern with digital asset markets, though, it only remains to be seen how long the coin can sustain its move. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Ripple Builds XRP ‘Wall Street Kit’: Developer Claims ‘Billions Incoming’",
    "body": "Software engineer and AI founder Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) is arguing that institutional barriers to holding and using XRP have largely shifted from “market structure” to “plumbing,” claiming Ripple has spent 2025–2026 assembling an institutional stack for custody, treasury, and prime brokerage that makes large-scale participation operationally viable. In a post on X on Wednesday, the engineer framed self-custody as a non-starter for traditional allocators managing retirement pools, pensions, and bank balance sheets. Ripple Assembles The XRP ‘Wall Street Kit’ “Institutions juggling billions in 401(k)s, pensions, hedge funds, banks & governments? Self-custody was always insane—audit hell, compliance nightmares, risk officers saying ‘no way,’” he wrote. “That changed in 2025–2026. Ripple built the full-stack bridge: regulated, scalable, bank-trusted infrastructure so big money can finally hold & use XRP + RLUSD without the chaos.” Related Reading: Why XRP Is Gearing Up For A Massive Week Van Code’s core contention is that the crypto-native custody debate misses the institutional reality: risk committees, auditors, and compliance functions require regulated custody, reporting, and controls that can plug into existing workflows. He argues Ripple’s recent buildout amounts to a “Wall Street kit” that addresses those constraints end-to-end, spanning payments rails, corporate treasury tooling, prime brokerage services, and bank-grade custody. While the post is advocacy rather than a formal Ripple announcement, it reflects a view increasingly common among XRP supporters: that productized rails and regulated wrappers matter as much as market narratives when large allocators consider adding exposure or utility. Van Code pointed to Ripple Payments as the transaction layer, describing it as “ISO 20022-compliant, real-time cross-border rails on XRPL—already moving billions for global banks.” He then tied institutional adoption to what he portrayed as adjacent infrastructure designed to make XRP and Ripple’s RLUSD workable inside corporate and financial-institution operations. Related Reading: XRP Is At An Unique Moment In History: Developer Calls End Of Suppression Among the pieces he highlighted was GTreasury, which Ripple acquired for $1 billion, characterizing it as an enterprise treasury management platform enabling corporations to manage “fiat + digital liquidity in real-time.” He also cited Ripple Prime, described as being “powered by Hidden Road acquisition for $1.25B”, as a prime brokerage stack offering “clearing, financing & OTC trading—including XRP & RLUSD—with seamless XRPL settlement for faster, cheaper post-trade ops.” For custody, he argued Ripple has converged on a bank-facing offering through a series of deals and integrations. “Ripple Custody (bolstered by Palisade acquisition + prior Standard Custody/Metaco) → Bank-grade, regulated storage with MPC security, multi-chain support & zero-trust architecture,” he wrote, adding that it is “auditable, insured, scalable for billions.” Van Code also claimed “RLUSD reserves [are] custodied by BNY Mellon for ultimate trust.” The post’s conclusion was blunt about expected impact. “Bottom line: Excuses erased. Compliance baked in. Custody risk? Solved,” Van Code wrote. “Institutions aren’t just watching—they’re quietly stacking & building on XRPL. 2026 is the year XRP shifts from ‘spec play’ to core financial infrastructure. Billions incoming.” If that thesis holds, the next signal for markets will not be rhetoric but observable integration: whether these components translate into sustained institutional flows, deeper liquidity venues, and production use of XRP and RLUSD, ultimately showing up in price discovery. At press time, XRP traded at $2.15. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "According to on-chain data, companies have piled into Bitcoin at a pace that now outstrips new supply. Corporate treasuries held by public and private firms rose from about 854,000 BTC to roughly 1.11 million BTC over the past six months, an increase of around 260,000 BTC — roughly 43,000 BTC per month. This adds close to $25 billion in value to corporate balance sheets and points to a growing appetite among firms for holding the coin, on-chain analytics provider Glassnode disclosed, Tuesday. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Watch $0.28 As Breakout Signals Stack Up Corporate Treasuries Swell A single firm dominates that pile. Strategy now controls the largest share of corporate Bitcoin, holding 687,410 BTC after a fresh buy earlier this month. The company disclosed it acquired 13,627 BTC between January 5 and January 11, its biggest purchase since last July. Reports have highlighted how this concentration means a few big buyers still shape the corporate treasury picture. Over the past 6 months, Bitcoin treasuries held by public and private companies have grown from ~854K BTC to ~1.11M BTC. That’s an increase of ~260K BTC, or roughly ~43K BTC per month, highlighting the steady expansion of corporate balance-sheet exposure to Bitcoin.… https://t.co/hHXjcSDDj4 pic.twitter.com/oluVGO2bGD — glassnode (@glassnode) January 13, 2026 Smaller, but still significant corporate holders are visible on the list. MARA Holdings, for example, holds about 53,250 BTC. That makes it one of the largest corporate holders after Strategy, and shows that miners and mining firms are also choosing to keep a chunk of the coin they create. ETF Demand Could Tighten Supply Exchange-traded funds are part of the story. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US pulled in more than $20 billion in flows during 2025, with some funds taking the largest share of those inflows. Analysts say ETF buying can soak up fresh supply and, if consistent, might remove available coins from the market for long periods. That dynamic has been flagged as one reason corporate accumulation could matter more now than in past cycles. Miners Are Producing Less Than Corporates Are Buying Over the same six months, miners are estimated to have created about 82,000 BTC. That means corporate buying has outpaced mining issuance by roughly three to one. In plain terms: more Bitcoin is being added to company balance sheets than is coming out of the ground, which tightens available supply if buyers continue to hold rather than sell. Related Reading: Futures Frenzy Pushed Crypto Exchange Volume To Nearly $80 Trillion In 2025 Price Action And Macro Watch Bitcoin has been trading in a narrow range near $92,000 ahead of key US inflation figures, with the $90,000 level seen as a psychological marker for traders. Safe-haven interest has stayed firm amid geopolitical noise and questions about central bank policy, leaving prices supported but range-bound. Short-term moves will likely reflect both ETF flows and whether existing holders keep selling into demand. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin’s Comeback Stalls As Crypto Funds Bleed Capital—Analyst",
    "body": "According to IG analyst Chris Beauchamp, Bitcoin is stuck in a fragile phase as the market tries to climb out of a rough patch. Prices have been moving in a narrow range and investors appear cautious. Related Reading: Futures Frenzy Pushed Crypto Exchange Volume To Nearly $80 Trillion In 2025 Bitcoin has been trading just above $94,000 when this report was made, which is about 3.5% higher than its opening price for the year of $88,650, but still below an early-year peak near $94,780. Fund Flows Keep Pressure On Reports show that fund movements have been a big drag on sentiment. Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.38 billion in outflows between January 6 and January 9. Based on CoinShares data, digital asset vehicles recorded a net outflow of $454 million in the prior week. The year opened with strong demand — crypto-based ETPs pulled in over $1 billion in the first two trading days — but that momentum faded and ETPs retained $580 million at the end of the week of January 3. Last week, investors withdrew $405 million from Bitcoin ETPs and $116 million from Ethereum ETPs. Those shifts in cash show how quickly mood can turn and how dependent the rally is on fresh money. CRYPTO FUND OUTFLOWS SLOW RECOVERY Cryptocurrencies are recovering gradually, but gains remain limited as investor caution persists, marked by continued outflows from crypto funds, says IG analyst Chris Beauchamp. He notes that prices lack fresh inflows needed for a stronger… — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 13, 2026 Key Levels And What They Mean Beauchamp pointed to $95,000 as a crucial level for Bitcoin. According to his note, a reclaim and steady hold above that area would be a sign the market has broken to the upside. At the time of writing, Bitcoin actually moved past the $94k level, briefly hitting $95.450 before returning to the $94k mark. On the downside, $90,000 is being watched as an important psychological floor. The market has been consolidating below its yearly high, and that tight range is keeping trading quiet. Some coins that had jumped earlier, like XRP and Cardano, have seen their gains trimmed as this consolidation takes hold. Macro Events Could Tip Prices Several outside factors could push the market one way or another. US inflation data, which sits at 2.7%, has reduced the odds of a near-term Fed rate cut, and that outlook can limit risk appetite in crypto. The banking sector’s Q4 earnings are scheduled to come through this week and may change investor tone if results surprise. A planned crypto market bill hearing was expected to act as a catalyst; it has since been moved to later in January. Then we have geopolitical tensions and questions about Fed independence have kept safe-haven demand alive, adding another layer of uncertainty. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Watch $0.28 As Breakout Signals Stack Up What Comes Next Based on reports and the analyst’s view, the recovery will likely need a fresh wave of inflows to gain real traction. If new capital arrives and Bitcoin can push past $95,000 and hold, higher prices could follow. If outflows continue and the $90,000 area fails to hold, downside pressure would increase. The story now is one of patience and watching for clear signs — in fund flows, in US economic figures, and in corporate earnings — that the market’s mood has turned more confident.

    "body": "Bitcoin pushed past $95,000 on Tuesday, drawing attention from traders and analysts who say real buying of the coin, rather than bets on derivatives, is driving the move. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New Power Buyers: Companies Bought 3 Times What Miners Produced According to figures from Coingecko, the cryptocurrency was trading at $95,250 at the time of publication, after a 4.50% gain over 24 hours. Reports have disclosed that $269 million in Bitcoin short positions were wiped out in that span, a wave of liquidations that helped add upward momentum. Spot Buying Fuels The Move Several market watchers pointed to spot purchases as the main force. Crypto analyst Will Clemente posted on X that the rally appears to be “led by spot buying.” That matters because buying the actual asset signals direct demand for Bitcoin itself, not just betting via futures or options. Short sellers were hit hard; their positions were closed out as prices jumped, and that squeeze added fuel to the advance. Seems like this rally on Bitcoin is led by spot buying and getting faded by perps as funding goes negative while open interest rises + most spot volume in days. (disclosure currently long btc) pic.twitter.com/pL9C8GFJYR — Will (@WClementeIII) January 13, 2026 Calls For $100k And The Odds Some traders are now predicting a quick run to six figures, saying that it is quite clear Bitcoin could reach $100K in the coming weeks and that any dips should be bought. Based on reports from Polymarket, the prediction markets place about 51% odds on Bitcoin reclaiming $100,000 by Feb. 1 and show a 23% chance of a $105,000 print. Bitcoin last fell below $100,000 on Nov. 13, leaving a resistance level that bulls want to clear. History Gives A Mixed Signal January’s record for Bitcoin has been modest on average, delivering roughly a 4% gain since 2013. February has tended to be stronger, with an average return of 13%. These averages do not guarantee the path ahead, but they give traders a context for how the market has behaved in recent years. Market moves can be quick. They can also stall. Macro Risks And Technical Levels Traders were watching $90,000 as an important support level while Bitcoin cruised past $95k ahead of US inflation data that could shift bets about rate cuts. Safe-haven demand has been in play as geopolitics and questions about central bank independence weigh on global markets. Price action is currently tight, with many saying the market sits inside a narrow band and will likely break out one way or the other. 😮 Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies are rebounding. $94K has just been crossed again for $BTC, and there will likely be retail FOMO creeping in if crypto’s top asset begins teasing $100K in the next few days. 📊 In the chart below, high spikes of: 🟦 #Lower or… pic.twitter.com/5pcwtB0mls — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 13, 2026 Retail FOMO Could Add Fuel Meanwhile, crypto sentiment tracker Santiment warned that renewed teasing of $100K could pull retail traders back in, sparking fresh FOMO across the market.

    "body": "The privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR) is once again in the spotlight after reaching new record highs, even as governments tighten oversight of digital assets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Don’t Celebrate Too Early: This Level Still Must Fall XMR recently surged past $700, marking its highest price to date and placing it among the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The rally reflects a broader shift in market behavior, where demand for financial privacy is rising alongside stricter regulatory frameworks across major economies. Currently, XMR is trading near $715, up more than 55% over the past week. Trading activity has picked up sharply, with both spot and futures markets showing elevated volume as traders position around the breakout. XMR's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: XMRUSD on Tradingview Regulatory Pressure Fuels Privacy Demand The latest move comes as regulators in Europe and other regions prepare new rules targeting anonymous crypto transactions. The European Union is expected to ban privacy coins and anonymous accounts by 2027, alongside tighter Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements. Instead of discouraging interest, these measures appear to be driving users toward assets with built-in privacy features. Monero, which utilizes stealth addresses and ring signatures to conceal transaction details, has become a primary choice for users seeking financial confidentiality. Market data indicate that the privacy coin sector has performed well since the broader crypto market downturn in October. While some rivals, such as Zcash, experienced sharp volatility linked to internal governance issues, XMR has absorbed much of the rotation in capital from traders seeking exposure to privacy assets. Leverage And Technical Signals Raise Short-Term Risks Alongside strong spot demand, derivatives activity has increased rapidly. Futures volume has shown repeated “overheating” patterns, suggesting that leverage is chasing price rather than building from long-term accumulation zones. In past Monero cycles, similar conditions often led to sharp swings once momentum slowed. Technically, Monero remains in an uptrend, holding above former resistance in the $500–$520 range, which has now flipped into support. The price continues to form higher highs and higher lows, confirming the broader bullish structure. However, momentum indicators are stretched. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed into the mid-80s, a level that historically precedes either sideways consolidation or short-term pullbacks. Bollinger Bands are also widening, with price pressing against the upper band, a sign of elevated volatility. Key Monero (XMR) Levels to Watch Going Forward The $715–$717 area remains a major psychological and technical barrier. A sustained break above that zone could open the door toward the $730–$740 range, based on Fibonacci extension levels. On the downside, traders are watching the $650–$620 zone as a potential support area if leverage unwinds. Deeper corrections could test trend support if liquidations accelerate, though the broader structure would remain intact as long as higher lows are preserved.

    "body": "Crypto analyst Morja has revealed his PEPE price prediction, alluding to the level the meme coin must hold to sustain its bullish momentum. Another crypto analyst painted a scenario in which the meme coin replicates the parabolic run it recorded in 2023. PEPE Price Could Sustain Bullish Momentum If It Holds This Level In an X post, Morja stated that a weekly candle close above the red level at $0.000005853 for the PEPE price would confirm a successful retest and reinforce the bullish movement. He further remarked that as long as the price holds above this level, upside continuation remains favored. Related Reading: If You’re A PEPE Investor, You Need To See This Or Risk Losing Your Coins However, the analyst warned that on the way toward $0.000010867, a key resistance is located around $0.0000083, which may act as a significant reaction zone before any further upside continuation. Meanwhile, crypto analyst StudyE has painted a scenario in which the PEPE price goes parabolic, replicating its historic 2023 run. The crypto analyst stated that this would happen if the PEPE price pumps into the January 15 to February 15 window. He further explained that the meme coin needs to be at the unfinished monthly candle in that time window in order to invalidate this. An invalidation would send PEPE higher first, and then the bottom would be in. If that doesn’t happen, it may have one more hurdle to overcome. StudyE stated that no matter the path the PEPE price takes, it would lead to the same outcome and timeframe. Based on this, he declared that the fourth quarter of this year will be parabolic, regardless of what happens. It is worth mentioning that PEPE has been one of the best-performing crypto assets to start the new year, with the meme coin up over 30% year-to-date (YTD). PEPE Eyes Rally To $0.00000728 In The Short Term Crypto analyst CryptoLinx has predicted that the PEPE price could rally to $0.00000728 in the short term. The analyst noted that PEPE is breaking out of the downward channel right now and that the target for this pattern is a move back to the previous high. This is a level that the meme coin had reached at the beginning of the year, when it rallied by as much as 80%. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 430% PEPE Price Rally If This Level Holds In the long term, crypto analyst Eco Nomad stated that the PEPE price will rally to $0.00001, which is the midpoint of the Gaussian channel. If the meme coin breaks that level, he is confident that it could trade within the 4 zeros, having deleted one zero in the process. At the time of writing, the PEPE price is trading at around $0.000006670, up almost 14% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "Zcash Foundation Investigation Closed: SEC Decision Sparks 12% Jump In ZEC Price",
    "body": "On Wednesday, the Zcash Foundation announced a significant development regarding its ongoing operations: the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has concluded its investigation into the public charity. This news has sparked a notable recovery in the price of the Zcash native token (ZEC), signalling renewed investor confidence, with trading volume surging by 39% over the past 24 hours. Zcash Foundation Cleared By SEC The Zcash foundation received a subpoena from the regulatory agency back in August 31, 2023, as part of a broader inquiry titled “In the Matter of Certain Crypto Asset Offerings (SF-04569).” Related Reading: XRP Potential: Four Q1 2026 Triggers That Might Propel Price Beyond $8 After a thorough review, the Zcash Foundation was informed that the SEC does not plan to recommend any enforcement actions or changes pertaining to the organization. This comes amid significant regulatory changes towards digital assets under the Trump administration, including the appointment of the pro-crypto Paul Atkins as chair of the SEC. Similar enforcement actions against firms such as Uniswap (UNI), Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD) were dropped last year. ZEC Price Surges Near $440 In their statement, the foundation expressed satisfaction with the outcome, emphasizing their commitment to transparency and adherence to regulatory standards. They reiterated their focus on advancing financial infrastructure that preserves user privacy for the greater good. Related Reading: The NYC Token Crash: Allegations Of Rug Pull After $2.5 Million Liquidity Withdrawal Following this announcement, ZEC experienced a robust increase of 12%, pushing its price to approximately $437.75 at the time of writing. This surge comes after the cryptocurrency had recently dipped to a near one-month low of $363 last Saturday, illustrating a significant turnaround. However, even with this recent boost, the Zcash token still has a long way to climb. The cryptocurrency remains 86% below its all-time high of over $3,191, according to CoinGecko data.

    "title": "BTC Breaks Higher as Record Bitcoin ETF Inflows Trigger Wave of Bearish Liquidations",
    "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) surged sharply this week, surpassing the $96,000 mark as renewed institutional demand and easing inflation concerns boosted sentiment across crypto markets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Don’t Celebrate Too Early: This Level Still Must Fall The action followed a strong inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and a softer-than-feared U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which reduced expectations of aggressive interest rate tightening by the Federal Reserve. The rally ended a prolonged consolidation phase that had kept Bitcoin trading sideways for more than a month. As prices broke through key resistance levels near $94,000–$95,000, short sellers were forced to close positions, adding further momentum to the upside. BTC's price records important gains on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Institutional Return U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $753.7 million in net inflows on Tuesday, the largest single-day total since October. Fidelity’s FBTC led with $351 million, followed by Bitwise’s BITB with $159 million and BlackRock’s IBIT with $126 million, according to data from SoSoValue. The surge suggests institutional investors are rotating back into crypto-linked products after year-end portfolio adjustments and tax-related selling weighed on the market in late 2025. Ether-focused ETFs also saw renewed interest, with $130 million in net inflows across five products. Bitcoin rose around 3% following the data, trading near $94,600 at the time, while Ethereum gained more than 6% to around $3,320. Broader crypto markets followed, lifting total market capitalization above $3.3 trillion. Inflation Data Supports Risk Assets The latest U.S. CPI report showed inflation holding steady at 2.7% year-on-year, largely in line with expectations. The absence of an inflation surprise reduced fears of further rate hikes and reinforced views that the Federal Reserve could pivot toward rate cuts later in the year. Lower real-rate expectations typically support risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, by reducing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets, such as Bitcoin. U.S. equities also advanced, suggesting the crypto rally was part of a broader shift in risk sentiment rather than an isolated move. Short Liquidations Add Fuel to the Rally As Bitcoin surged past $96,000, bearish positions were wiped out. Data from Coinglass shows more than $290 million in Bitcoin short positions were liquidated within 24 hours, compared with about $24 million in long liquidations. Across the broader cryptocurrency market, short liquidations totaled close to $700 million. Strong spot buying, rising open interest, and technical breakouts contributed to the move. Bitcoin is now testing former resistance levels as support, with chart patterns indicating a possible continuation toward the $105,000–$110,000 range if momentum persists. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New Power Buyers: Companies Bought 3 Times What Miners Produced While short-term consolidation remains possible near the $98,000–$100,000 zone, sustained ETF inflows, reduced selling pressure from long-term holders, and continued corporate accumulation suggest underlying demand remains firm.

    "title": "Ethereum Outlook Has Improved, And It Could Outperform Bitcoin – Here’s What To Know",
    "body": "Ethereum’s outlook has been improving its case. After a prolonged period of underperformance and skepticism, the network is starting to exhibit signs of renewed structural and fundamental strength. While BTC continues to anchor the market as the primary store of value and digital gold, conditions are emerging that could allow ETH to outperform BTC over the coming period. Why The Ethereum Narrative Is Gaining Strength Ethereum has been seen outperforming Bitcoin. In a recent post on X, Walter Bloomberg revealed that Standard Chartered says that the ETH outlook has improved, and now ETH might outperform BTC, citing rising institutional demand and stronger fundamental positioning across key on-chain sectors. Related Reading: Altcoin Season In Q1? Bitcoin, Ethereum Breakdown Maps Out Performance While weakness in BTC has weighed on the broader crypto market, ETH has continued to benefit from institutional-driven demand, and its dominance in stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi), and real-world assets (RWA) tokenization. Standard Chartered also points to the increased throughput and potential US regulatory clarity that it could provide additional upside. In terms of valuation, the bank forecasts ETH at $7,500 this year and $30,000 by 2029, reflecting the expectations of sustained network growth. The Co-founder of PinkBrains_io, a DeFi Creator Studio, DefiIgnas, has highlighted that Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin this year, and the reason is roadmap execution. While BTC will likely keep facing recurring waves of quantum FUD into 2026, ETH has a clear roadmap to prepare for future cryptographic risks. Furthermore, ETH is actually scaling. Gas limits on layer 1 keep rising, and zkEVMs will get full production readiness, making ETH cheap and fast enough for high-value transactions, while layer 2s will handle most of the trading and high-frequency activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Market Structure Points To Crypto Winter – Details These upgrades are incremental, which means there’s no breaking news moment for ETH, but progress is happening fast. Early in the cycle, a lot of Degens loaded up on ETH before the bull run, but many got disillusioned and sold their ETH for BTC. “It would be fun to see the playbook reverse higher,” DefiIgnas noted. A Different Liquidity Cycle Than Previous Bull Markets Crypto liquidity quality witnessed a change in 2025. A technical analyst and show host of Crypto Banter, Kyledoops, reported that Wintermute noted that capital in 2025 stopped rotating broadly across the market. Instead, liquidity is concentrated into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a small group of large-cap tokens. As a result, the long-anticipated wave of altcoin-wide liquidity never really arrived. Meanwhile, the rise of spot ETFs and crypto treasury vehicles created a new, highly structured inflow channel that funneled flow into the top of the market. These vehicles break the crypto’s oldest playbooks. Price action is no longer driven by broad market expansion. It’s driven by where new liquidity can actually enter.
