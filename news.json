    "title": "Ethereum Founder Breaks Silence With Major Upgrade Proposal",
    "body": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has unveiled a major proposal that could fundamentally reshape how the network handles transaction fees. His new design aims to replace unpredictable costs with a system that lets users plan and budget more effectively, signaling one of the most significant shifts in Ethereum’s economic framework in years. Ethereum Gas Fees As Predictable, Prepaid Resources Buterin’s proposal centers on a new on-chain gas futures market. Today, gas fees rise and fall based on network congestion and users have no way to know in advance what they will pay, which complicates planning for developers, businesses, and high-volume platforms. Related Reading: XRP Price Is Performing As Expected; Analyst Reveals What Comes Next The new model reshapes that dynamic by allowing users to purchase a defined amount of gas at a fixed price for future use. Rather than hoping the network will be affordable at the moment they need to transact, they can lock in their costs in advance. This moves Ethereum from a system dominated by short-term fee volatility to one anchored in stable, forward-looking pricing Under the proposed design, these futures contracts would be traded directly on-chain. Their prices would naturally reflect expectations of future demand. When demand is expected to increase, futures prices rise; when expected to fall, they drop. This creates a transparent, market-driven view of upcoming network activity, giving developers and organizations a more reliable basis for planning their operations. The structure also builds on the foundation set by EIP-1559, which introduced the base fee mechanism. Buterin’s futures market doesn’t replace that system—it extends it. It transforms gas from reactive cost into a resource that can be managed in advance, similar to how businesses lock in costs for electricity, bandwidth, or other essential inputs. Operational Benefits For Developers, Businesses, And The Network The most immediate benefit is cost certainty. High-volume users—exchanges, rollups, wallets, and automation services—often operate on tight margins, and sudden gas fee spikes disrupt operations and planning. By locking in future gas costs, this uncertainty is removed, supporting consistent service delivery. Developers also gain a stable environment, enabling them to schedule upgrades, plan deployments, and manage workloads without worrying about fee surges. This predictability strengthens project roadmaps and enhances user experience. Related Reading: Are Dogecoin Whales Leaving The Meme Coin? Large Transactions Crash To 2-Month Lows For enterprises integrating Ethereum into payments, verification, or data-processing workflows, predictable fees are essential. Buterin’s model addresses this barrier, positioning Ethereum as a more reliable foundation for long-term, large-scale adoption. At the network level, the futures market introduces clearer economic signals. Rising futures prices indicate increasing demand for blockspace, guiding scaling decisions and resource allocation. Falling prices signal lower demand, enabling more efficient development and infrastructure planning. The proposal does not lower gas fees but makes them manageable, converting an unstable cost into a predictable one. This enhances Ethereum’s appeal for serious applications, institutional activity, and reliable operational planning. By introducing a gas futures mechanism, the ecosystem can better manage costs and prepare for growth, marking a decisive step toward a more professional-grade Ethereum.

    "body": "XRP’s price has continued to chop, trading sideways, which has impacted the price of the U.S. spot ETFs that provide exposure to the altcoin. Canary Capital’s XRP fund has crashed 20% since its launch, although this fund remains the largest by assets under management (AuM). XRP’s Sideways Price Action Leads To Spot ETF Crash The XRP price has continued to trade within a tight range, just above the psychological $2 level, sparking bearish sentiment among investors. The altcoin is down over 10% in the last month, around the time the first spot XRP ETF, Canary’s fund, launched. This bearish price action has notably contributed to a price crash for Canary’s XRPC fund. Related Reading: XRP ETFs Are About To Hit $1 Billion – Here’s How Much Is Flowing In Daily TradingView data shows that Canary’s XRP ETF is down 20% since its launch on November 13. XRPC also dropped almost 10% last week amid choppy price action. Canary’s fund has also likely crashed due to increased competition from three other spot funds that launched after it. This has led to a slowdown in its inflows since these funds launched. Meanwhile, these funds track the spot XRP price, which also explains Canary’s XRPC crash. XRP has mirrored Bitcoin’s price action amid concerns that the crypto market may already be in a bear market. XRP whales also look to be bearish at the moment, as Santiment data shows a drop in whale transactions from a recent high recorded in November. However, despite this bearish sentiment, with the crypto market currently in a state of fear, the XRP ETFs have continued to record daily net inflows. SoSo Value data show that these funds have been on a 16-day net inflow streak since Canary’s XRP fund launched on November 13, and they have yet to record a net outflow day. Canary’s XRP ETF, which has suffered a 20% price crash, is currently the largest spot XRP fund with $364 million in assets under management. Grayscale’s GXRP is second with $211 million, while Bitwise and Franklin Templeton are third and fourth. As a group, these XRP funds are about to hit $1 billion in assets under management, with $861 million in total net assets. Some Positives For The Altcoin Santiment data show that XRP exchange outflows have outweighed inflows in recent times. This is a positive as it indicates that more investors are accumulating than selling. Exchange outflows typically represent moves for long-term holding, especially in anticipation of higher prices. Related Reading: Pundit Predicts That XRP Is About To Make Investors Extremely Rich In an X post, Santiment mentioned that the XRP Ledger is seeing a fascinating trend of whale and shark wallets shrinking in number but continuing to grow in coins held. The on-chain analytics platform noted that there are 20.6% fewer 100 million XRP wallets, but that these wallets, as a group, still own a 7-year high 48 billion coins. As such, the existing 100 million XRP wallets are doubling down on their accumulation efforts and making up for the shrinking number of wallets. At the time of writing, the altcoin’s price is trading at around $2.07, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Poised For Lift-Off As Key Bullish Catalysts Kick In: Ex-CEO",
    "body": "According to former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, battles over the US debt ceiling create clear cash swings that move markets. When the Treasury spends down its main checking account — the Treasury General Account, or TGA — new dollars enter the system and lift risky assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Is Just Getting Started — 200x Growth Possible, Tom Lee Says Later, when the Treasury refills the TGA by selling debt, cash is pulled back out and pressure returns to stocks and crypto, he said. Hayes points to 2023 as a clear example, when a large pool of funds at the Fed’s reverse repo facility — about $2.5 trillion — was available to be drawn back into markets. Market Metrics And Recent Moves Traders can see the effects in price action. Bitcoin’s recent fall toward the $80,000 area followed a stretch of tighter liquidity, and the rebound to above $91,000 has many investors asking whether the sell-off marked a cycle low. The crypto market gained ground Monday, with total capitalization rising to a little over $3 trillion, up 1.2% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin climbed to $92,120, a 1.50% increase on the day and almost 6.5% higher over the week. Ethereum traded around $3,160 after a 4% daily rise and an 11% weekly jump. Reports have disclosed that these moves come as traders watch big-dollar flows tied to US Treasury operations and central bank balance sheet moves. Smaller gains in the last day sit against larger weekly returns for several top tokens, showing that swings remain wide but that buying interest has reappeared. Why 2025 Looks Different Based on reports, Hayes says 2025 is not the same as 2023. The reverse repo balances that helped fuel the earlier rally are largely gone, and liquidity tightened by almost $1 trillion between July and late 2025 as the Treasury issued debt and the Fed ran quantitative tightening. That drought of available cash was a headwind for risk assets and helped push prices lower. The mechanics are simple: less cash chasing assets tends to reduce bids and widen price drops. Price Reaction And Cross-Market Effects The liquidity story is not limited to crypto. Stocks, gold, and property responded to the same flow shifts during the prior cycle. Hayes estimates that about $2.5 trillion of liquidity was effectively redeployed from Fed facilities into markets in 2023, amplifying gains across asset classes. When that source was absent in 2025, selling pressure intensified and volatility rose. Related Reading: Massive Bitcoin Awakening: 2 Physical Coins Unlock $179 Million After 13 Years Favorable Market Conditions Hayes says the environment has shifted in a positive way. The Fed has put quantitative tightening on hold, liquidity pressure in the Treasury market is calming down, the TGA is close to where officials want it, and banks are starting to open up their lending taps again. He views the slide toward $80,000 as the cycle low and expects upward pressure as cash conditions improve. According to his view, these factors together create the environment for renewed upside.

    "title": "Bitcoin To Hit $50 Million By 2041, Says EMJ Capital CEO",
    "body": "EMJ Capital CEO Eric Jackson has laid out one of the most aggressive long-term bitcoin targets in the space yet, arguing in an interview with reporter Phil Rosen that the cryptocurrency could reach $50 million per coin by 2041. His projection is tied to a thesis that bitcoin will evolve from “digital gold” into the core collateral layer of the global financial system. Jackson said his thinking grows out of the same “hundred bagger” framework he used when buying beaten-down equities like Carvana. He recalled entering Carvana after its share price collapsed from around $400 to roughly $3.50 in 2022, at a time when sentiment was almost universally hostile. “You would hear things like, that’s run by a bunch of criminals. This is what a bunch of idiots. Like you’d have to be an idiot to let your company go from $400 this year to $450 or $350 rather,” he told Rosen. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Profitability Hits ‘Complete Reset’ — What’s Next For Price? For Jackson, that period illustrated how markets behave at extremes. “It’s human nature almost that when you’re in the moment of max pain or pessimism, you can only see what’s right in front of you,” he said. Yet the underlying product remained strong: “It wasn’t a broken platform. It wasn’t a broken service they would tell you they loved it. It was so easy. It was the best customer experience they had.” From there, he could “envision how they were going to be like a much more profitable business” once the company focused on profitability and addressed its debt. Jackson’s Long-Term Thesis For Bitcoin He applies the same long-horizon lens to bitcoin, arguing that the day-to-day ticker and polarized narratives obscure its structural potential. “We get so tied to turning on the TV and just seeing, like, what’s the price of Bitcoin today […] Some people are bearish and they say, oh, it’s a Ponzi scheme. And some people are bullish and they just, you know, throw these like kind of pie in the sky targets that you can’t really tie to reality,” Jackson said. “It’s kind of hard to latch on to like, what is the value of this thing?” Jackson begins with the common “digital gold” framing. He asks how large the gold market is, how many central banks and sovereigns hold it and why. “Could Bitcoin be as big as gold one day? That seems like a safe assumption,” he argued, adding that because it is “digital” and “programmable” rather than a “hunk of rock,” younger generations may prefer it as a store of value. But he stresses that this is only part of the story, as bitcoin has not become a medium for daily transactions “since the guy who bought pizza with Bitcoin back in like 2011.” The “penny dropped,” he said, when he began to think in terms of what he calls the “global collateral layer” that underpins borrowing by sovereigns and central banks. Historically, that base layer moved from gold to the Eurodollar system from the 1960s onward, and today is heavily intertwined with sovereign debt. “All the countries around the world issue debt and then they kind of borrow against that and they do their daily like government transactions,” he noted, but “there are problems with that.” Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Top Analyst Assigns 91.5% Probability In Jackson’s “Vision 2041,” bitcoin replaces the Eurodollar and, functionally, becomes the neutral asset that other balance sheets are built upon. He argues that bitcoin is “much superior” as collateral because it is digital and “apolitical,” sitting outside central banks and the influence of “whoever the latest treasury secretary here is in the US.” As with the Eurodollar, he does not see this as a direct attack on the dollar or Treasuries, but as a new underlying layer: “There’s some underlying thing that a lot of other countries and the financial systems borrow against to kind of do things.” Eric Jackson (@ericjackson) expects bitcoin to hit $50 million by 2041. He compares his thesis to how he knew Carvana, $CVNA, would be a 100-bagger stock pick. pic.twitter.com/CA9BWoR4zF — Phil Rosen (@philrosenn) December 7, 2025 Looking ahead 15 years, Jackson envisions sovereigns that currently issue and roll debt instead “rely on Bitcoin,” because “over time, like that’s much more logical.” Given the “enormous” scale of the sovereign debt world, he argues that if bitcoin becomes the dominant collateral substrate, its price per coin would need to reach orders of magnitude above current levels—hence his $50 million-by-2041 target. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,574. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "According to reports, a well-known crypto commentator/investor who goes by the handle Crypto X AiMan has sold all his Bitcoin and moved the proceeds into XRP. He says four reasons drove his decision, and the move has stirred debate across trading circles. Related Reading: Massive Bitcoin Awakening: 2 Physical Coins Unlock $179 Million After 13 Years Investor Dumps Bitcoin For XRP AiMan, who says he first bought Bitcoin when it traded at $3,000, told followers that legal clarity is the main reason for his shift. He pointed to a July 2023 court ruling by Judge Torres that found certain programmatic XRP sales were not securities. According to him, that court decision gives XRP a different standing from many other tokens. He also noted that US regulators often treat Bitcoin as a commodity, a stance reiterated by former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. AiMan framed the court outcome as a rare, explicit legal test that favored XRP. He highlighted another factor: Ripple’s large holdings. Based on company disclosures, Ripple holds close to 40 billion XRP, nearly 40% of the total supply. AiMan argued those reserves could support future use cases if Ripple or its partners chose to deploy the tokens for payments. I just sold ALL my Bitcoin. Yes, you read that right. I went 100% all-in on XRP. Here’s why: XRP is the only crypto with legal clarity in the United States (won the SEC case, not a security). Ripple owns ~40B XRP and is partnered with 300+ banks, central banks, and payment… pic.twitter.com/tRzpiKPas5 — Crypto X AiMan (@CryptoXAiMan) December 5, 2025 He called XRP faster and cheaper to move than Bitcoin, saying it is built for cross-border transfers — a point he used to contrast XRP’s utility with Bitcoin’s role as a store of value. He also ran through a market-size scenario. Market analysts have projected the cross-border payments market at $250 trillion by 2027, and AiMan suggested that even a 1% share of that volume could mean big gains for XRP. He admitted the trade is extreme: “If I’m wrong? XRP probably goes to zero, and I lose everything,” he said. He added that if he is right, the payoff would be huge. XRP’s Legal Advantage Market reaction has been mixed. Based on reports from data providers, traders are taking large short positions against XRP. Coinglass figures show XRP with $15 million in shorts versus $0.6 million in longs — a roughly 96% short allocation and a shorts-to-longs ratio near 25 to 1. For comparison, Bitcoin had $131 million in shorts and $70 million in longs; Ethereum showed $110 million shorts and $58 million longs. Despite heavy shorting, XRP has posted daily gains at times, according to recent price movements. Aggressive Shorts Dominate Positioning Analysts say heavy short positions can indicate weak near-term sentiment. They also create technical risks, because a squeeze could push prices higher quickly if shorts are forced to cover. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Is Just Getting Started — 200x Growth Possible, Tom Lee Says That does not remove the core risks AiMan flagged and others raised: a big token allocation held by one company raises centralization concerns, and banks have not broadly shifted settlement rails to public tokens. Bitcoin still has a market cap near $1.8 trillion and deeper liquidity, which many investors view as stability in a volatile market. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Here’s How High The Dogecoin Price Will Go Once The MACD Bullish Cross Happens",
    "body": "The Dogecoin price has been drifting through a subdued stretch over the past few days, holding around the mid-$0.13 to $0.14. The recent decline has slowed down in the past 48 hours, and the chart now shows the meme coin attempting to steady itself after weeks of persistent selling pressure. Trader Tardigrade, a well-known crypto analyst on X, shared a new three-day chart suggesting that an important MACD signal is on the verge of forming, and historical performance shows that Dogecoin tends to move bullish once this signal appears. Approaching The MACD Bullish Cross Dogecoin’s quiet phase in the past 48 hours has become increasingly important because one of Dogecoin’s higher-timeframe indicators is beginning to show early signs of life. According to Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin’s MACD indicator on the 3-day candlestick price chart has not yet confirmed a bullish cross, but it is very close to doing so. Related Reading: Trend Reversal Puts Dogecoin On A Path To $0.188 The chart he shared shows the MACD lines converging at the lower boundary of the recent downtrend, and the blue line is approaching the red line. The blue line is about to cross over the red one, mirroring the exact setup that preceded previous breakouts earlier this year. Even with Dogecoin trading quietly in recent days, the compression of the MACD indicator hints that bearish momentum is fading. Once the cross officially forms, the trend will shift into a bullish one. This gradual tightening of price movement is also characteristic of an accumulation phase, and this is shown by an important Dogecoin metric. Dogecoin Price Chart, MACD Cross. Source: @TATrader_Alan On X How High The Dogecoin Price Could Go The chart reveals a clear pattern: every time Dogecoin printed a three-day MACD bullish cross in 2025, the price responded with a significant upward move. The first cross was in April, and this preceded a rally that pushed Dogecoin’s price from below $0.14 into a breakout to $0.26. A second cross followed during mid-summer in July, and once again the price climbed aggressively shortly afterward. This saw the Dogecoin price rally from around $0.16 to $0.30 very briefly. Related Reading: The MicroStrategy Of Asia: Japanese Company Announces Plan For Bitcoin And XRP Treasury Both events are circled on the chart above, showing how the momentum flipped swiftly once the MACD crossed above the signal line. These repeated reactions strengthen the case that Dogecoin could be preparing for another sizeable run if the indicator confirms a cross in the coming days. The projection area drawn on the right side of the chart points to a climb that extends well above $0.20. This suggests that the next wave may revisit the upper levels where Dogecoin last traded during its late-summer rally. The analyst’s chart outlines a wide upward arc, indicating that the expected move would not be a minor rebound but a structured uptrend similar to the earlier surges this year. In terms of a price target, the projection shows Dogecoin reaching a price target around $0.35 in the next few weeks. This would translate to a 140% increase from Dogecoin’s current price of $0.142.

    "title": "Smart Whales Align: Top Performers Go All-In On Ethereum Long Positions With Over $425M in Exposure",
    "body": "Ethereum has reclaimed the $3,150 level after a volatile stretch, offering a rare sign of strength in an otherwise uncertain market. The broader crypto landscape remains sharply divided: some analysts argue that ETH and the rest of the market still face downward continuation, potentially setting new local lows, while others believe this correction is simply a reset before a much larger bull cycle—possibly extending into 2026. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Break $97K To Restore Confidence Among Youngest Long-Term Holders – Details Yet one signal stands out clearly amid the noise: smart whales are unanimously going long on ETH. On-chain data shows that several of the most profitable and consistent whale traders—each with tens of millions in realized gains—have opened substantial long positions, collectively exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars. Their coordinated behavior indicates confidence that Ethereum’s recent lows represent opportunity rather than danger. This alignment among top-performing whales introduces a compelling counterpoint to bearish narratives. While retail sentiment remains fragile, the most sophisticated market participants appear to be positioning for a larger move ahead. As Ethereum stabilizes above $3,150, the question now becomes whether whale conviction will prove to be early—or correct. Top Performers Load Up on Ethereum According to Hyperdash data shared by Lookonchain, some of the most successful and influential whales in the market are aggressively accumulating Ethereum—sending a strong signal that high-conviction players expect upside ahead. One of the most notable is BitcoinOG, the trader widely recognized for shorting the market during the violent 10/10 crash, a move that earned him significant credibility. With a total realized PNL of $105 million, BitcoinOG is now positioned firmly on the bullish side, holding 54,277 ETH worth approximately $169.48 million. Another major player is the well-known Anti-CZ whale, named for his historical pattern of taking the opposite side of positions favored by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. With an impressive $58.8 million in total PNL, this whale is currently long 62,156 ETH—a massive $194 million position. His trades have often been early indicators of broad market direction, adding weight to this shift toward bullish exposure. Finally, pension-usdt.eth, a consistently profitable whale address with $16.3 million in realized gains, is long 20,000 ETH valued at $62.5 million. Taken together, these positions reflect a unified stance among top-performing whales: despite market uncertainty, they are positioning for Ethereum strength. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows Signs Of Accumulation As CVD Strengthens And Correlation Stays Elevated Weekly Structure Shows Early Signs of Stabilization Ethereum’s weekly chart reveals a market attempting to regain its footing after a sharp multi-week decline from the $4,500 region. The recent reclaim of $3,150 is a meaningful development, as this level aligns closely with prior weekly support from mid-2024 and sits just above the 50-week moving average—an area that often acts as a trend-defining zone. ETH briefly dipped below this region during the November selloff, but buyers stepped in aggressively, producing a strong weekly wick that signals demand at lower levels. Despite this recovery attempt, ETH remains below key resistance levels. The 20-week and 100-week moving averages are positioned above the current price and converging, creating a zone of potential rejection unless momentum strengthens. For now, ETH is trading in a transitional structure: no longer trending downward aggressively, but not yet showing a confirmed bullish reversal on high timeframes. Related Reading: Ethereum NUPL Holds Steady, Signaling Market Balance Amid Volatility Volume patterns also support this interpretation. Selling volume has diminished compared to the capitulation phase, while recent green candles show moderate but steady buying interest—suggesting accumulation rather than full risk-on behavior. If ETH can establish consecutive weekly closes above $3,200–$3,300, the chart opens the door for a retest of the $3,600–$3,800 range. Failure to hold $3,150, however, risks another move toward $2,800 support. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Is Just Getting Started — 200x Growth Possible, Tom Lee Says Around 2 million people in four regional banks can now buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and USDC through the apps. Measured Limited Rollout The launch covers the Provence-Alpes-Côte-d’Azur branch of Caisse d’Épargne and the Île-de-France division of Banque Populaire, among others. BPCE has said it will watch early use closely. That controlled approach is meant to catch technical issues and fix the user flow before wider availability. If all goes to plan, the bank intends to extend the feature across its 25 remaining regional entities by 2026, reaching a retail base of roughly 12 million clients. 🔴 EXCLUSIVE @TheBigWhale_: BPCE now lets customers buy crypto assets. Starting this Monday, the French bank’s customers will be able to purchase BTC, ETH, SOL, and USDC: https://t.co/J2C4UnWi68@GroupeBPCE, one of Europe’s leading banks, is rolling out this service in a first… pic.twitter.com/3olRgVoot4 — Raphaël Bloch 🐳 (@Raph_Bloch) December 6, 2025 BPCE has set up a separate unit, Hexarq, to handle customer crypto accounts. Each user will have a dedicated in-app digital-asset account that is managed by Hexarq rather than being routed to outside exchanges or third-party wallets. The arrangement keeps custody within the bank’s ecosystem. It also comes with a monthly fee of €2.99 and a trading commission of 1.5% on transactions. Banks Face Fintech Pressure Reports have pointed to the rise of fintech rivals as a driving reason for the move. Companies such as Revolut, Deblock, Bitstack and Trade Republic built early crypto offerings and attracted many retail users. Traditional lenders now risk losing younger customers unless they match those services. Some banks in Europe already offer in-app trading: BBVA supports Bitcoin and Ethereum, Openbank under Santander lists five cryptocurrencies, and Raiffeisen in Vienna provides similar features through a tie-up with Bitpanda. BPCE’s entry follows this trend and could push other big lenders to act.

    "title": "XRP Selloff: Whales Shed Coins Worth $1 Billion In A Week",
    "body": "On-chain data shows the XRP whales have distributed a significant amount during the past week, a sign of negative sentiment among large holders. XRP Whales Have Shed 510 Million Tokens From Their Holdings As announced by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, XRP whales have participated in a notable amount of selling recently. A “whale” is typically defined as an XRP investor holding between 1 million and 10 million tokens. At the current exchange rate of the cryptocurrency, this range converts to $2 million at the lower end and $20 million at the upper one.

These holders can carry some influence in the market, making the group a key one for the network. Now, here is the chart from on-chain analytics firm Santiment shared by Martinez that shows how the supply of the XRP whales has changed over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP whale supply has been following a downtrend since mid-November, indicating that the large holders have been distributing. The trend has continued during the past week, with entities belonging to the group collectively selling 510 million coins, worth more than $2 billion at the latest price. At the same time as the selloff over the last few weeks, XRP has witnessed some net bearish price action, implying that the whales may have had a role to play in it. Given that these humongous entities haven’t shown any signs of slowing down recently, it’s possible that the coin could see a further drop. It only remains to be seen, however, how whale behavior will develop in the coming days. In some other news, XRP could be set up for a 16% move according to a technical analysis (TA) pattern, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post. From the chart, it’s visible that XRP has roughly been traveling inside a Symmetrical Triangle on the 1-hour timeframe since November. A Symmetrical Triangle is a consolidation channel that involves two converging trendlines approaching each other at an equal and opposite slope. The coin is already more than halfway through the channel, meaning that its range is getting narrow. A narrower range means retests of the support and resistance levels become more frequent, making either more probable.

It now remains to be seen which direction the asset will exit, and whether the pattern will hold. XRP Price XRP has again found a rebound since its retest of the $2.00 level, as its price is now back at $2.09. Featured image from Dall-E, charts from TradingView.com",
