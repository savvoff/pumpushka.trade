    "title": "Crypto ETFs Defy The Pullback With $32 Billion In Fresh Investor Cash",
    "body": "According to Farside Investors data, US investors put close to $32 billion into US crypto exchange-traded funds in 2025 even as markets lost steam late in the year. Related Reading: Crypto Headed For A $10 Trillion Future? Hoskinson Says RWA Is The Key Spot Bitcoin ETFs drew the biggest share, with $21.4 billion in net inflows. That is smaller than the $35 billion that poured into Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. Blackrock Dominates Flows BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, IBIT, accounted for most of the activity. Reports show IBIT took in about $24.7 billion. That makes its inflows roughly five times larger than the nearest rival, Fidelity’s FBTC. Market watchers noted IBIT ranked near the top among all ETF flows, placing behind only a few broad index funds and a big treasury bond fund. If IBIT’s number is removed, the wider spot Bitcoin ETF group actually finished the year with about $3 billion in combined outflows. Grayscale’s Bitcoin product lost nearly $4 billion on the year. Bitcoin’s price was lower than at the start of 2025; it began the year around $93,500. Ethereum Interest Strong But Cooling Based on reports, interest in Ethereum ETFs was real, but the momentum looks uneven. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, ETHA, sits at nearly $12.6 billion in inflows. Fidelity’s FETH follows at $2.6 billion, while Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust ETF holds about $1.5 billion. Still, public on-chain data showed little renewed demand for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the last month of the year, suggesting flows may slow into 2026. Ether ETFs benefited from being new and giving investors a regulated way to own ETH, but recent days have seen quieter buying. Spot Ether ETFs, which only became widely tradable after their July 2024 launch, gathered $9.6 billion in their first full year. Spot Solana ETFs, launched in late October, added $765 million through year end. Altcoin ETFs Show Curiosity, Not Frenzy Litecoin and XRP ETFs also began trading in the latter half of the year, giving investors more choices for regulated altcoin exposure. The sums are small compared with Bitcoin and Ether. Solana’s $765 million is an example of early interest that has not yet turned into a large, steady stream of assets. These products are being tested by the market.

Regulators and exchanges moved faster this year under new SEC leadership that was more open to approvals, which in turn helped institutional adoption in the US.

    "title": "Bitcoin Could Be Setting Up A Comeback Vs. Gold, Analyst Suggests",
    "body": "A veteran market analyst has flagged a technical pattern that could signal a turning point for Bitcoin after months of underperformance versus gold. The move comes as traders weigh whether the long run of gains for the yellow metal has exposed limits in Bitcoin’s safe-haven story. Related Reading: Gold And Stocks Ran Ahead, But Bitcoin May Close The Gap In 2026 Bitcoin Versus Gold Ratio Down The Bitcoin-to-gold ratio has plunged. It fell from 32 on Oct. 5 to about 20 today, a drop of more than 37%. According to the data, that means one Bitcoin bought roughly 32 ounces of gold in early October but now buys about 20. The ratio’s slide has accelerated since gold’s rally took hold and Bitcoin’s price slipped below key levels. Daily readings point to a possible change in momentum. On Nov. 21 the BTC/GOLD pair hit a low of 20 and the RSI stood at 21.30. A lower low near Dec. 1 came with a higher RSI low of 26.83. Then another trough at 19 on Dec. 26 coincided with a higher RSI low of 32.21. That’s a valid bullish divergence on the daily timeframe for BTCUSD vs. Gold. Interested to see where that leads us into 2026. pic.twitter.com/D6ei8HsIDy — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 31, 2025 Based on reports, Michaël van de Poppe called this pattern a “strong” bullish divergence on the daily chart, a setup traders watch because it can show selling pressure easing even as prices make new lows. Technical Signals Show Cooling Selling Pressure On the weekly chart the picture adds weight to the signal. The weekly RSI for the BTC/GOLD pair has sunk to about 31.85 at press time. That level was last seen during the November 2022 sell-off tied to the FTX collapse, a point that marked a bottom in that cycle. Reports also link similar RSI lows to the bottoms seen in 2015 and 2018. Taken together, the daily divergence and the low weekly RSI make a stronger case that the downtrend may be losing steam, though nothing is guaranteed. Market Sentiment Splits Investors Gold’s rally has been dramatic. Reports show gold surged by over 70% in 2025 while Bitcoin fell by 7% over the year in some measures. At press time Bitcoin trades at $87,750, down 4.8% year-to-date. The breakdown in the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio and Bitcoin’s continued weakness below $100,000 have prompted fresh questions about the “digital gold” story as bullion posts historic gains. Short-term money appears to favor gold for capital protection. Many traders are treating the metal as a shelter while it climbs to new highs. Long-term holders, however, still point to Bitcoin’s potential for big upside once risk appetite returns. Related Reading: Crypto Headed For A $10 Trillion Future? Hoskinson Says RWA Is The Key According to market watchers, the near-term outlook hinges on whether the BTC/GOLD ratio and price action deliver follow-through above key levels.

    "title": "Dogecoin Mirrors AMD’s Setup From Last Year, Analyst Claims",
    "body": "Dogecoin’s pullback is starting to look like a setup, not a breakdown, at least according to crypto analyst Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow), who says the meme coin is behaving the way AMD did before its turn higher last year. Can Dogecoin Replicate The AMD Rally? In a X post on Dec. 31, the analyst argued that slipping prices on weakening volume and growing public reluctance to be bullish is exactly what improves the trade’s risk/reward. “I said that about AMD last year. I’m saying that about DOGE right now,” Cantonese Cat wrote. “The lower price goes down on low volume. The more worried influencers are to publicly be bullish on it. The less people care about this. The better risk-reward ratio there is.” The Dec. 31 chart is built around Fibonacci retracement levels mapped from DOGE’s prior move, with key bands marked at roughly $0.373 (0.886), $0.297 (0.786), $0.202 (0.618), $0.154 (0.5), $0.118 (0.382), $0.084 (0.236) and a lower reference near $0.049 (0). In that view, DOGE is shown sliding into the 0.382 region (around $0.118), a level many technicians watch as a make-or-break area for whether a pullback remains corrective or risks turning into a deeper unwind. Related Reading: Dogecoin Near $0.11–$0.12 Offers ‘Incredible Risk/Reward,’ Says Analyst Below price, Cantonese Cat’s volume bars are annotated with downward arrows, reinforcing the point made in the accompanying commentary: as DOGE moved lower, participation appeared to fade. For the analyst, that combination: declining price paired with softer volume and a more reluctant public tape fits a pattern where marginal sellers can exhaust without attracting aggressive new supply. Long-Term Dogecoin Price Targets Cantonese Cat’s earlier Dec. 20 post sets the broader roadmap, describing the preceding stretch as a prolonged downcycle and positioning the current phase as a corrective structure rather than a fresh trend. “We’ve already had a 13 month bear market for DOGE, with my working hypothesis of this being likely a wave 2 correction prior to wave 3 explosion,” the analyst wrote. “The entire reason why this may play out is that it doesn’t feel likely right now, and you want me to stop posting.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Mirrors Silver’s Breakout, Analyst Flags $9+ Scenario That Dec. 20 chart also projects upside targets using Fibonacci extensions, with levels plotted well above the prior range. The marked extension ladder includes roughly $0.90 (1.272), $1.25 (1.414), and $1.99 (1.618), with more aggressive levels further out near $4.78 (2.0) and $8.91 (2.272). The thesis is not that those levels are imminent, but that the convexity of a potential “wave 3” is what makes the current pullback, if it holds the corrective framing, attractive from a risk/reward standpoint. Notably, the AMD comparison is not the only cross-market framing Cantonese Cat has used recently. The analyst has also drawn parallels between Dogecoin and silver, according to our recent coverage, extending the same core idea across different assets: periods that feel uninteresting or unpopular can be precisely when the setup becomes more asymmetric. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.12. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "A major institutional player in global finance has made its position on XRP clear, placing the cryptocurrency at the center of its digital asset strategy. Franklin Templeton, an asset management firm handling over $1.6 trillion worth of assets, used a recent post on the social media platform X to explain why it is going deep into XRP as an asset, while also drawing attention to its Spot exchange-traded product, XRPZ. This interesting comment is part of a growing institutional confidence in XRP and the XRP Ledger. Franklin Templeton’s Strategic Entry With A Spot XRP ETF Franklin Templeton’s arrival in the XRP ETF space is one of the most significant endorsements of the token from a legacy financial institution. The firm launched the Franklin XRP Trust, trading under ticker XRPZ on the NYSE Arca in late November, offering investors regulated exposure to the digital asset without the operational complexity of holding the token directly.

Analysts Reveal What To Expect The fund is structured as a grantor trust that holds XRP and calculates its net asset value daily based on established reference rates, with custody provided by Coinbase Custody Trust Company and administration by BNY Mellon. Recent comments from leading voices at the fund manager reveal that the decision to launch a Spot XRP ETF is due to their strong belief in XRP and the XRP Ledger. Roger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton, highlighted the XRP Ledger’s designed capability for real-time, low-cost settlement and efficient cross-border payments. Furthermore, he noted that the altcoin’s market capitalization and role in global value transfer make it an important component worth regulated exposure for investors with a broad portfolio. The firm’s broader digital asset suite already includes Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, and XRP was the latest to join this year. Franklin Templeton traces its roots back to 1947 and has built a reputation of trillions in equity, fixed income, and multi-asset investments in markets all around the world. Its move into crypto ETFs, now encompassing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP exposure, is part of many established asset managers now actively engaging in the crypto industry. Performance And Market Reception Of XRPZ Since Launch Several issuers received clearance for Spot XRP ETFs in 2025, making it possible for institutions and everyday investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrencies through regulated means. Since their debut in November, the Spot ETFs, including XRPZ, have attracted meaningful capital flows.

Analyst Answers Collectively, these products have drawn more than $1.16 billion in net inflows, maintaining consecutive days of inflows that stand in contrast to recent days of outflows in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ itself has grown its holdings past 100 million XRP, with a cumulative inflow of about $242 million at the time of writing.

    "body": "South Korea’s top money-laundering watchdog has slapped crypto exchange Korbit with a fine worth about ₩2.73 billion, or roughly $1.90 million, after finding widespread lapses in its compliance controls. Related Reading: Crypto Headed For A $10 Trillion Future? Hoskinson Says RWA Is The Key According to regulator statements and multiple news reports, the move follows an on-site inspection that uncovered thousands of rule breaches and several risky transfers abroad. Regulatory Findings And Scope Of The Inspection The Financial Intelligence Unit said inspectors found nearly 22,000 breaches related to AML and KYC rules. The FIU said the inspection, carried out from October 16 to 29, 2024, exposed serious gaps in how Korbit verified customer identities and handled transactions. Reports have disclosed that the exchange allowed some customers to trade before full verification was completed and accepted unclear or incomplete identity documents in many cases. The regulator also flagged 19 overseas transfers involving three unregistered foreign virtual asset service providers, a practice that is restricted under Korean law. The FIU highlighted the failure to carry out required risk checks for certain services, including some nonfungible token activities. In total, 655 cases were cited where mandatory risk assessments were not completed, according to the findings. Corporate responsibility measures were taken as well: the CEO received a formal caution and the compliance officer was reprimanded. An institutional warning was issued alongside the monetary penalty. Transaction Failures And Enforcement Details The inspection report described multiple instances where trading or withdrawals proceeded despite incomplete KYC steps. Such lapses raise the chance that illicit funds could move through the platform without timely detection. The FIU’s action is part of a broader push by South Korean authorities to tighten oversight of exchanges and bring them into closer alignment with international anti-money-laundering standards. Market sources indicate Korbit has been in discussions with Mirae Asset Group about a potential deal, with the exchange’s valuation reported at around ₩140 billion — roughly $97–$98 million. That interest comes even as regulators step up scrutiny, showing that traditional finance remains curious about crypto assets despite compliance headaches. Related Reading: Crypto ETFs Defy The Pullback With $32 Billion In Fresh Investor Cash What The Penalty Means For The Industry Other exchanges have also faced tougher checks in recent years as authorities press platforms to shore up controls. The Korbit case is likely to prompt more internal reviews across the sector and could speed up changes in procedures, staffing and technology meant to prevent repeat failures. Some measures will be public, while others may be handled behind closed doors. Korbit declined to comment directly to some outlets, while the FIU confirmed the sanction on December 31, 2025. The exchange will now need to demonstrate fixes or face possible further action. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Analyst Reveals Why The Bitcoin Price Is Extremely Bearish Right Now",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s short-term price action is still without bullish momentum, and according to macroeconomist Henrik Zeberg, the longer-term outlook may be deteriorating as well. Henrik Zeberg shared a strongly bearish assessment of the market’s current structure in a post on the social media platform X with the conclusion that Bitcoin is no longer behaving like an asset in a healthy expansion phase. Instead, he described Bitcoin as approaching an important peak, warning that the current structure carries an elevated risk of a sharp downside move once that peak is in place. Bitcoin’s Expanding Diagonal Points To Price Top Zeberg’s Bitcoin outlook is based on the expanding diagonal structure on Bitcoin’s monthly candlestick timeframe chart. This long-term pattern, which has been playing out since Bitcoin’s creation, shows increasing volatility, with the Bitcoin price making higher highs and lower lows with a widening range. Related Reading: People Are Not Ready For Bitcoin; Analyst Reveals What’s Coming Next According to the chart he shared, Bitcoin appears to be completing the final stages of this structure, and this is expected to be characterized by exhaustion. Zeberg labels the current zone as a topping area, where upside progress becomes increasingly unstable even if the price continues to increase. Interestingly, the chart projected a final surge as a blow-off top that could carry Bitcoin to the mid-$150,000 range. However, in this framework, that final push is not a sign of strength but a hallmark of late-cycle overconfidence. Expanding diagonals tend to resolve violently once the structure breaks, and Zeberg views the current setup as looking like where optimism peaked just before a reversal. From Euphoria To A Deep Crash Scenario Zeberg’s most controversial claims are in his projected downside targets. According to him, once the final euphoric rally plays out and Bitcoin reaches above $150,000, it could enter into a collapse on a scale that most Bitcoin investors currently consider unthinkable. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts When The Bitcoin Supercycle Will Actually Begin He compared the setup to the dot-com era, when the Nasdaq fell by more than 80%, and noted that Bitcoin has historically amplified both upside and downside moves. Based on that logic, he predicted a scenario where a broader AI and crypto bubble unwinds, leading to a Bitcoin price crash of about 97% or 98% from the eventual peak. This translates into a technical minimum target between $3,000 and $4,000, with the possibility of even deeper declines. Although the final rally may be dramatic, holding through the subsequent crash could be devastating for unprepared investors. Zeberg also highlighted momentum indicators that he believes support the bearish outlook. Bitcoin is showing what he describes as massive bearish divergence on the monthly timeframe. This is a situation where price continues to grind higher but momentum indicators such as the RSI fail to confirm those highs. Another indicator is the monthly MACD, which is also approaching, or already printing, a bearish crossover on the long-term chart. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Cycle Defined by Demand, Not Price: CryptoQuant Head Says",
    "body": "Head of research at on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has explained how demand makes the basis of a Bitcoin cycle, rather than price performance. Bitcoin Apparent Demand Has Been Declining Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno has talked about Bitcoin cycles from a different lens. “Most are focusing on price performance to define a cycle, when it is demand what they should be looking to,” noted Moreno. Related Reading: XRP At Risk Of A Drop To $0.80? Analyst Makes The Case The analyst has gauged the “demand” for the cryptocurrency using the Apparent Demand indicator, which compares the daily miner issuance against the changes in the 1-year dormant supply. The first of these, the miner issuance, is the amount that miners are “minting” on the network every day by receiving block rewards. This metric essentially reflects the “production” of the asset. The 1-year inactive supply, on the other hand, can be thought of as the cryptocurrency’s “inventory.” Thus, the Apparent Demand basically compares the production of Bitcoin against changes taking place in its inventory. Below is the chart shared by Moreno that shows the trends in the 30-day and 1-year versions of the Apparent Demand over the past decade. As is visible in the graph, the last few Bitcoin cycles have all transitioned into a bear market when the Apparent Demand has plunged into the negative region on both the monthly and yearly timeframes. In the current cycle, the 30-day Apparent Demand has plunged into the red zone recently, suggesting that the monthly demand for the asset has been negative. On the annual scale, the metric is still at a positive level, but its value has been following a downtrend. If this decline keeps up, it won’t be long before the indicator has dipped into the negative territory. Considering the pattern from the previous cycles, the current structure in the Apparent Demand is certainly looking bearish. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the yearly version of the metric will cross into the red zone or if it will rebound, signaling the return of demand. Spot demand isn’t the only way to measure Bitcoin demand these days. With the advent of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), there has been some fresh off-chain demand coming into the cryptocurrency this cycle.

    "title": "Dogecoin Long-Term Bullish Structure Still In Play And Will Cross $10",
    "body": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is back in focus as long-term chart structures continue to signal sustained bullish potential. While recent monthly price action has remained muted, a crypto analyst maintains that the meme coin’s broader technical trend has not been compromised. The analyst has projected that DOGE could eventually rally toward a long-term move beyond the $10 level. Dogecoin Bullish Structure Points Toward $10 On December 31, crypto market expert Olivier D Maximus posted on X that Dogecoin remains structurally bullish and could eventually cross $10. He noted that although price action has been slow and unimpressive, DOGE’s bullish framework continues to favor higher valuations in the long term. Related Reading: 7-Period Fractal Trend Says Dogecoin Price Is Headed To $10 He shared a new detailed chart analysis, indicating that DOGE’s monthly close generated little short-term excitement. However, he emphasized that the broader bullish framework remains intact, with attention now turning to what January may bring as the next decisive phase. Maximus pointed out that long-term structures often move quietly before big gains, and Dogecoin appears to be following this pattern. He stressed that patience is required when analyzing higher time frames, as monthly charts tend to capture macro trends rather than immediate volatility. In his view, the current consolidation does not invalidate Dogecoin’s upside thesis. The analyst’s chart showed Dogecoin trading within a clearly defined Ascending Channel that has held for several years. The meme coin’s price remains above the long-term rising support zone, reflecting higher lows over time. Additionally, multiple diagonal trend lines show that DOGE’s price has repeatedly corrected toward mid-channel support before resuming upward movement. These pullbacks appear controlled, reinforcing the possibility of a healthy long-term uptrend. Maximus has also spotlighted several ATH levels he expects Dogecoin to reach over time. The ascending channel seen on the chart points toward potential targets above $12, extending as high as $25. Moreover, the analyst has suggested that if Dogecoin maintains its structural integrity, future trends could push the meme coin into double-digit territory, making a surge from under $1 to $10 technically plausible. DOGE Enters Make Or Break Zone In 2026 In a separate X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade revealed that the Dogecoin price is currently trading within a Descending Triangle, with the price sitting at the tip of the pattern around $0.122. This level has been highlighted as a potential make-or-break point where a pullback or surge could determine Dogecoin’s next big move. Related Reading: What The Rise In Open Interest Means For The Dogecoin Price If price breaks above the upper boundary of the Descending Triangle, Trader Tardigrade predicts that Dogecoin could experience a breakout to the upside. He has set a target of around $0.132, representing a surge of approximately 8.2% from the current price level. On the other hand, if DOGE breaks below the lower boundary of the triangle, the meme coin could tumble further toward $0.116, representing a roughly 4.9% crash.
