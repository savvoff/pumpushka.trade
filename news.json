    "title": "Ethereum Sees Largest Binance Inflow Since 2023 – Warning Sign?",
    "body": "Ethereum has spent the past several days consolidating in a tight range between $3,000 and $3,200, signaling a moment of hesitation as the broader market struggles to find direction. Despite attempts to push higher, momentum has flattened, and uncertainty continues to dominate sentiment. Many analysts now warn that Ethereum may be entering a deeper bearish phase, pointing to weakening spot demand, fragile market structure, and fading optimism across major exchanges. Related Reading: Smart Whales Align: Top Performers Go All-In On Ethereum Long Positions With Over $425M in Exposure However, one on-chain development has captured the market’s attention. According to new data from CryptoQuant, December 5, 2025 saw a massive spike in Ethereum Exchange Netflow to Binance, marking one of the largest daily inflows in years. Such a surge typically raises questions about investor intentions: large inflows often signal that holders are moving ETH onto exchanges with the potential to sell, increasing the probability of short-term volatility or downside pressure. Yet the broader context matters. Ethereum’s price remains above key support, suggesting that the market is in a critical decision zone rather than a confirmed breakdown. This combination of consolidation, rising caution, and an unusually large exchange inflow sets the stage for what could become a pivotal moment for ETH as traders prepare for the next major move. Massive Netflow Surge Raises Caution for Ethereum According to data from CryptoOnchain shared on CryptoQuant, Ethereum experienced a striking shift in exchange activity on December 5, 2025. The netflow to Binance reached 162,084 ETH while the price hovered near $3,021, marking the largest daily positive netflow since May 2023. Such an influx is significant, not only because of its size but because of what it typically signals: a rise in the number of investors moving ETH from self-custody to exchanges. Historically, large positive netflows are interpreted as potentially bearish, suggesting that holders may be preparing to sell or rebalance. When deposits drastically outweigh withdrawals, it can precede heightened selling pressure, especially when the market is already in a fragile state. Inflows of this magnitude can act as a temporary supply shock; if even a portion of this ETH hits the order books as market sells, the price could face increased volatility or short-term corrective pressure. Because of this, traders should closely monitor how Binance absorbs this liquidity. Watching order book depth, open interest reactions, and subsequent netflow patterns will reveal whether this was a one-off spike or the beginning of a broader shift in investor behavior. In a market this delicate, even a single inflow event can set the tone for the days ahead.

After dipping below $2,800 in late November, ETH has managed to reclaim the $3,100 region, where it has been consolidating for several days. This range-bound behavior signals a pause in the prior downtrend, yet the recovery lacks the strong momentum typically seen in bullish reversals. The 50-day and 100-day moving averages remain positioned above the current price, forming a clear zone of resistance between $3,250 and $3,500. These declining MAs highlight that the broader trend still favors sellers, and ETH will need a decisive breakout above them to shift market sentiment. The 200-day MA, sitting higher, reinforces the idea that Ethereum is still trading below its long-term trend structure.

The recent spike in exchange netflows adds another layer of caution, raising the possibility of increased near-term selling pressure. ETH is showing early signs of stabilization, but the path forward requires stronger conviction. Until price breaks above the cluster of moving averages, this recovery remains fragile and vulnerable to renewed downside pressure. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin Stabilizes Above Key Support as Adoption Rises and Long-Term Outlook Strengthens",
    "body": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is, in another consecutive week, settling into a familiar pattern: holding firm at a crucial support zone while market participants weigh technical signals, shifting adoption trends, and the ever-present influence of its community. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Crash Incoming? Twenty One Capital Moves 43,500 BTC Amid Major Losses As the token trades around $0.14, its price behavior reflects a broader phase of consolidation, characterized by tighter volatility and increasing on-chain engagement. With new real-world use cases emerging and traders watching for a breakout, DOGE’s long-term trajectory is becoming a point of renewed discussion. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Network Activity Strengthens as Dogecoin Price Holds Key Support Despite muted market reaction to Dogecoin’s 12th anniversary, activity on the network continues to rise. Daily active addresses reached over 67,000 earlier in December, marking the second-highest level in three months. This increase comes as DOGE repeatedly defended the $0.14 support, forming a tight compression range between $0.1406 and $0.1450. Short-term charts indicate multiple rebounds from the $0.14 level, accompanied by decreasing sell volume, an early sign of accumulation. Analysts identify $0.16 as the threshold that would shift DOGE from range-bound movement into a potential trend continuation. Failure to hold support, however, could expose deeper downside toward $0.081, an area highlighted by realized on-chain distribution clusters. Adoption Expands Beyond Market Narratives Recent developments show Dogecoin slowly expanding beyond its memecoin label. In Argentina, certain taxes can now be paid using DOGE, while Alternative Airlines has begun accepting the token for ticket purchases. These integrations, although still modest, indicate real-world traction that supports a longer-term use case narrative. Broader sentiment, however, remains closely tied to macroeconomic conditions. Analysts note that liquidity trends, regulatory developments, and institutional risk appetite continue to shape DOGE’s outlook. The launch of the first Dogecoin ETF in November drew little initial inflow, signaling that large investors remain cautious despite the token’s growing visibility. Long-Term Structure Points to Potential Upside From a structural standpoint, Dogecoin continues to follow a multi-year pattern that some analysts view as constructive. Long-term charts show price action moving within a large triangle formation dating back to 2021, with a cup-and-handle structure still intact on higher timeframes. Weekly RSI levels near 50 resemble conditions seen before DOGE’s 2021 rally, while MACD indicators approach bullish crossovers on both weekly and monthly charts. Forecasts place Dogecoin’s path toward $1 as a possibility later in the decade, with projections suggesting a climb toward that level by 2030. In the near term, the $0.145–$0.16 zone remains the defining barrier that could determine whether DOGE transitions into a stronger upward phase or remains confined to its current band.

    "body": "Ethereum saw a flurry of big moves that traders say could matter for its next price swing. In just a few hours, major accounts pulled large sums off an exchange and big wallets opened sizable margin longs. Market watchers are parsing those moves for clues. Related Reading: All-In On XRP: Why This Leading Investor Sold His Entire Bitcoin Stack Institutions Shift Big Stakes According to Arkham Intelligence, Amber Group and Metalapha pulled out 9,000 Ether from Binance in a short span, a haul worth more than $28 million at current prices. Based on reports, institutional flows have been heavy for months — nearly 4 million ETH has been accumulated by institutions over five months. Those kinds of transfers are often linked to custody setups or long-term holdings rather than quick trades. Whales Add Margin Bets Several large wallets added roughly $426 million in margin long exposure. Wallets named 1011short and Anti-CZ are among the accounts that expanded long bets. That kind of activity raises the chance of sharper moves in either direction: if prices rise, longs can feed a rapid upswing; if a pullback hits, forced selling could amplify losses. Market structure is tighter now than it was several months ago. 🚨 INSTITUTIONS ARE ACCUMULATING $ETH ~ QUIETLY. In the last few hours: • Amber Group withdrew 6,000 ETH ($18.8M) from Binance • Metalapha withdrew 3,000 ETH ($9.4M) That’s 9,000 ETH pulled off exchanges in a single morning. This is the same pattern we’ve seen for weeks:… pic.twitter.com/MBgyXoPfJz — BMNR Bullz (@BMNRBullz) December 8, 2025 Available Supply Shrinks On-chain data shows only 8.7% of ETH is currently held on exchanges. More than 28 million ETH is locked up in staking, custody, and what reports call long-term storage. Staking inflows remain high, with over 40,000 ETH added per day on average. Less supply on exchanges can lower immediate selling pressure, making price swings more dependent on fresh buy orders. Price Range And Key Levels Ethereum has gained 2.5% in the last 24 hours and is trading near $3,050. According to an analyst’s chart, ETH has been moving inside a tight range between $3,050 and $3,200, with $3,100 acting as a support line. Traders say a clear break above the $3,300–$3,400 band could open the way toward $3,700 to $3,800. Failure at that resistance would likely push prices back toward $3,000, where buyers may step in again.

    "title": "Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Fall To Lowest Levels on Record: The Bullish Signal Most Traders Are Missing",
    "body": "Bitcoin is holding above $90,000 as the market heads into a highly anticipated FOMC meeting, a moment that could define the next direction for risk assets. But while price action keeps traders on edge, on-chain indicators are painting a surprisingly different picture beneath the surface. According to a new CryptoQuant report by XWIN Research Japan, Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have continued to fall sharply throughout 2025, even as price corrected toward the $90K range. Related Reading: Smart Whales Align: Top Performers Go All-In On Ethereum Long Positions With Over $425M in Exposure The data shows that the total amount of BTC held on centralized exchanges has dropped to 2.76 million BTC, reaching one of the lowest levels ever recorded. What makes this trend even more striking is its timing: during the steep November–December sell-off, exchange balances did not rise—they fell faster. The report highlights this behavior in the red-marked zone of the chart, showing accelerating outflows while the price was dropping. This pattern signals something unusual: investors are not sending coins to exchanges to sell into weakness. Instead, they continue withdrawing BTC into long-term custody, suggesting confidence rather than capitulation. As volatility builds ahead of the FOMC decision, the contrast between short-term price fear and long-term accumulation is becoming one of the most important dynamics in the current Bitcoin market. Shrinking Exchange Reserves Signal Structural Strength The report emphasizes that Bitcoin’s rapidly shrinking exchange reserves carry important structural implications for the market. When fewer coins sit on centralized exchanges, it means less Bitcoin is available for immediate sale, effectively tightening the liquid supply. According to the data, this decline is not being driven by short-term speculators but by long-term holders and institutional entities steadily moving BTC into self-custody or cold storage. What makes this trend remarkable is its timing. Historically, sharp price declines trigger a wave of inflows to exchanges as investors prepare to sell or panic-exit their positions. This cycle, however, tells a very different story. Even as Bitcoin corrected into the $90K region, exchange balances kept falling, suggesting that buyers with a long-term outlook are actively accumulating rather than retreating. This divergence between price action and on-chain behavior signals underlying strength. While short-term volatility may continue—especially around macro catalysts like the FOMC meeting—the broader structure points toward a market quietly tightening its available supply. As reserves move toward historic lows, a future “supply shock” becomes increasingly plausible. Despite the weak spot market performance, on-chain metrics are slowly turning bullish, hinting that the foundation for the next major trend may already be forming beneath the surface. Related Reading: Ethereum Loses Momentum While OI Holds Steady: Binance Data Shows A Market Reset BTC Tests Critical Support as Market Awaits Direction Bitcoin’s price action on the 3-day chart shows a market attempting to stabilize after a sharp corrective phase. BTC is currently trading around $90,437, hovering just above the 200-day moving average — a level that has historically acted as a major dynamic support during mid-cycle retracements. The recent bounce from the $87K–$88K region suggests that buyers are defending this zone, but the structure remains fragile as long as the price stays below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which are now sloping downward. The chart reveals a clear shift in momentum. After months of steady higher lows, Bitcoin broke its ascending structure in late November, leading to a fast drop toward the high-$80K range. Volume increased during the decline, indicating stronger participation on the sell side. However, the subsequent candles show shrinking sell volume, hinting at exhaustion among short-term sellers. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows Signs Of Accumulation As CVD Strengthens And Correlation Stays Elevated For a meaningful recovery, BTC must reclaim the $95K–$97K area, where previous support turned into resistance. Failure to break that zone would likely keep the market in a consolidation phase, with risks of another retest of the 200-day MA. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Ethereum Price Climbs Toward $3,300 For The First Time Since November: What’s Driving The Surge?",
    "body": "On Tuesday, the Ethereum price experienced a notable surge, climbing by 6.5% and reclaiming the critical $3,300 mark for the first time in nearly a month. This has allowed Ethereum to outpace its peers among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, showcasing a nearly 12% recovery for the leading altcoin over the past week. ETH Grows In Demand Analysts from Bull Theory attribute this resurgence to several key factors, including significant institutional interest in Ethereum. The firm highlighted BitMine, which holds the largest public company collection of ETH, as a major player in this recovery phase. In a recent social media update on X (formerly Twitter), the analysts pointed out that demand for ETH is on the rise as Wall Street quietly builds on the Ethereum platform. Related Reading: Crypto Market Structure Talks: Senator Lummis Addresses Latest Legislation Plans Notably, major financial institutions are beginning to make substantial moves in the Ethereum space. BlackRock, which manages $13.5 trillion, is launching tokenized funds and has filed for a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). Other notable players include JPMorgan with $4 trillion in assets, Deutsche Bank at $1.1 trillion, and Standard Chartered with $800 billion. These firms are developing tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure specifically on Ethereum and its Layer 2 (L2) solutions. In addition, well-known financial entities such as Amundi, HSBC, BNY Mellon, Coinbase (COIN), Kraken, and Robinhood (HOOD) are incorporating Ethereum into their operations for functions like custody, settlement, and rollup infrastructure. As a result, these large companies are holding and staking ETH to generate yield, significantly increasing the altcoin’s demand. BitMine, for instance, anticipates earning over $400 million annually from its staking position. Could The Ethereum Price Hit $12,000? Such institutional involvement has led market experts like Tom Lee to speculate that the Ethereum price could potentially reach $12,000 by 2026, driven by growing staking demand and the scaling of tokenization efforts. Adding to the momentum, Arkham reported that Tom Lee’s Ethereum treasury firm acquired 138,452 ETH since last week, valued at approximately $431.97 million. BitMine currently holds $12.05 billion in ETH and has an additional $1 billion allocated for further purchases. Related Reading: Wall Street Giant Bernstein Predicts Bitcoin Price To Hit $1 Million By 2033 In a different development that could bolster the Ethereum price further, Chris MacDonald, an analyst for The Motley Fool, highlighted reports indicating that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) confirmed US banks can now legally conduct “riskless principal” transactions in crypto assets. The analyst asserted that this new regulatory approval may lead to an influx of capital into digital assets, which would likely benefit the Ethereum price and holders, as well as other top cryptocurrencies. As of this writing, the Ethereum price is trading at $3,325. Despite recent gains, the price is still nearly 33% below the all-time high of $4,946, which was reached earlier this year.

    "title": "Historic Reversal: Ethereum ETF Flows Plunge To Worst Month Since Launch",
    "body": "Ethereum’s momentum in institutional markets just hit a major roadblock. After months of enthusiasm surrounding spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), new data has shown that ETF flows have sunk to their worst monthly total since their launch. The sharp drop reflects a broader cooldown in investor demand, as market volatility and shifting risk appetite weigh on crypto allocations. Will Staking ETFs Emerge To Stabilize Flows? In an X post, a crypto analyst known as Milk Road revealed that the Ethereum ETFs had just printed their worst month on record since launch, which is roughly $1.4 billion in net outflows, the largest single-month withdrawal that ETH has ever encountered. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows Signs Of Accumulation As CVD Strengthens And Correlation Stays Elevated Historically, ETF flow reversals tell more about liquidity pressure in the broader financial system than the long-term fundamentals of the asset itself. When redemptions spike this hard, it’s usually a sign that broader risk sentiment is cracking, not that the asset itself broke. Meanwhile, most investors don’t know that while ETFs were handing back, Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) stepped in as aggressive buyers. BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) quietly added over 300,000 ETH, worth nearly $800 million at the time, to its treasuries. If the ETF outflow continues to accelerate, the near-term price action will remain choppy as liquidity gets strained at the edges. However, if DAT inflows continue scaling, it builds the foundation for a tighter supply setup into 2026. The tension between this panicked short-term selling pressure and the quiet structural long-term accumulation is the most important dynamic for positioning. Why ETH Reserves Are Becoming Strategic Corporate Assets Crypto trader Bull Theory has noted that last week, BitMine bought an astonishing 138,452 ETH, worth $437.7 million. This single transaction solidifies their position as the largest ETH treasury in the world, holding 3.86 million ETH, valued at $12.4 billion and accounting for 3.2% of the entire circulating supply. Related Reading: Here’s Why Ethereum Emerges As The Global Capital Rails For On-Chain Finance The true source of rising ETH demand is that Wall Street is quietly building on ETH. BlackRock, with $13.5 trillion AUM, has launched tokenized funds on ETH and has filed for a staked ETH ETF. JPMorgan, with $4 trillion, Deutsche Bank, with $1.1 trillion, and Standard Chartered, with $800 billion, are developing tokenization and DeFi infrastructure using ETH and its Layer-2 networks. Institutions like Amundi, HSBC, BNY Mellon, Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood are all using ETH rails for custody and settlement or rollup infrastructure for scaling and security. Furthermore, large companies are now holding and staking ETH for yield. BitMine alone expects to generate $400 million+ a year in staking revenue from its position. Tom Lee believes that as staking demand grows and institutions scale tokenization increases, ETH could reach $12,000 in 2026. “A Bitcoin miner is now the largest Ethereum whale, Wall Street is building on ETH, and treasuries are shifting toward yield. ETH is quickly becoming part of the Global Financial System.” Bull Theory noted. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin Is ‘Climbing Another Wall Of Worry’– Here’s Why",
    "body": "Ark Invest’s CEO and CIO, Cathie Wood, joined Fox Business’s “Morning With Maria” to discuss her investment strategy as she believes the US is entering a “historic productivity surge,” and why she is bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) for 2026. Related Reading: All Eyes On Ethereum: Price Attempts Key Breakout As BlackRock Files For Staked ETH ETF The Four-Year Cycle Will Be ‘Disrupted’ On Tuesday, Ark Invest’s CEO, Cathie Wood, shared her perspective on the recent Bitcoin performance, which has retraced over 10% in the past month and struggled to reclaim crucial levels over the past few weeks. To Wood, Bitcoin has been behaving like a risk-on asset and is currently “climbing another wall of worry” that has made investors wary of the leading crypto asset’s upcoming performance. As she explained, there is a fear of the four-year cycle, which suggests that 2026 will be a corrective year for Bitcoin. Historically, BTC has seen significant price pullbacks during bear markets, with retraces of up to 75% to 90% in previous cycles. The aggressive Q4 2025 correction has shattered most investors’ expectations of an end-of-year bull run, raising concerns that the crypto market has already entered the bearish phase of the cycle after the more than 30% drop from the October highs. However, Ark Invest’s CEO considers that “the four-year cycle is going to be disrupted” as volatility has significantly diminished over the past few years, and large-scale investors turn to the rapidly growing industry. “We think that the move by institutions into this new asset class is going to prevent much more of a decline,” Wood affirmed, noting, “we might have seen it a couple of weeks ago,” when BTC managed to hold the $80,000 barrier during the late November correction. She previously asserted that growing institutional adoption will be a powerful driver for long-term value for the cryptocurrency, adding that institutions “really have just dipped their toes into this space. We have just started, so we have a long way to go.” Bitcoin To Outperform Gold Soon? During the interview, Wood also reaffirmed her previous forecast that the flagship crypto will outperform gold next year, despite its choppy performance during the last quarter of 2025. She highlighted that “gold is more of a risk-off asset,” and its 60% year-to-date (YTD) rise is “proof” that Bitcoin is climbing a wall of worry as investors “are using gold as a hedge against geopolitical risks.” Nonetheless, Ark Invest’s CEO pointed out that between the early 80s and the late 90s, gold peaked and “went down as we were in the golden age of innovation, ending with the internet.” Related Reading: Wall Street Giant Bernstein Predicts Bitcoin Price To Hit $1 Million By 2033 Now, she believes that the same could happen soon, as what she calls “the AI age” starts and the market potentially recovers. Meanwhile, she forecasted that Bitcoin would remain risk-on and outperform gold in 2026. “I really believe we are moving from a rolling recession where we’ve been for the last three years, into a rolling recovery, which we think we are entering now. Then, a productivity-driven boom the likes of which we have never seen before,” Wood concluded. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,011, a 3.75% increase in the daily timeframe.

    "title": "Standard Chartered Cuts 2026 Bitcoin Price Prediction By 50%",
    "body": "Standard Chartered has sharply reduced its famously bullish Bitcoin roadmap, cutting its 2026 price target in half and acknowledging that its previous near-term projections were too aggressive, even as it keeps an ultra-optimistic long-term view intact. Standard Chartered Downgrades Bitcoin Price Predictions In a note shared on X by VanEck head of research Matthew Sigel, Standard Chartered argues that Bitcoin’s traditional halving cycle has been overtaken by ETF-driven flows. The bank writes: “With the advent of ETF buying, we think the BTC halving cycle is no longer a relevant price driver. The logic in previous cycles (when US ETFs did not exist) – i.e., prices would peak about 18 months after each halving and decline thereafter – is no longer valid, in our view.” The report adds that it will “take a break of the current all-time high ($ 126,000 on 6 October 2025) to prove that; we expect this to happen in H1-2026.” Related Reading: Bitcoin In An Opportunity Zone? Hash Ribbons Flash New Buy Signal Alongside that shift in framework, the bank re-profiled its multi-year Bitcoin targets. According to the figures shared by Sigel, Standard Chartered has lowered its 2025 forecast from $200,000 to $100,000, its 2026 target from $300,000 to $150,000, its 2027 projection from $400,000 to $225,000, its 2028 estimate from $500,000 to $300,000, and its 2029 prediction from $500,000 to $400,000 while keeping a $500,000 target for 2030. Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets research, characterises the recent drawdown as painful but not structural. He describes the current phase as “a cold breeze,” explicitly rejecting the notion of a new crypto winter and noting that the magnitude of the pullback remains consistent with corrections seen in past bull cycles. At the same time, he points out that weaker valuations for listed Bitcoin treasury companies have curtailed their ability to act as major marginal buyers, leaving spot ETFs as the primary driver of near-term gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $50 Million By 2041, Says EMJ Capital CEO Wall Street Giant Bernstein Agrees The downgrade also lands in the context of a broader rethink on Wall Street. One day earlier, on December 8, Sigel shared a separate note from Bernstein that reached a similar conclusion about Bitcoin’s market structure. Bernstein wrote that “the Bitcoin cycle has broken the 4-year pattern (cycle peaking every 4 years) and is now in an elongated bull-cycle with more sticky institutional buying offsetting any retail panic selling.” Despite an approximately 30% correction, the firm notes that “we have seen less than 5% outflows via ETFs.” On that basis, Bernstein now moves its 2026 Bitcoin price target to $150,000, sees the cycle “potentially peaking in 2027E at $200,000,” and keeps its long-term 2033 target at roughly $1,000,000 per BTC. Both Standard Chartered and Bernstein are converging on the same structural message: the halving alone no longer explains Bitcoin’s trajectory. ETF flows, institutional positioning and balance-sheet dynamics are now the core variables, even if their precise price targets and timelines diverge. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $92,686.

    "body": "A sharp slowdown in buying pushed the NFT market back toward its weakest levels of the year, as weekly and monthly totals fell sharply and overall valuations continued to slip. Related Reading: All-In On XRP: Why This Leading Investor Sold His Entire Bitcoin Stack According to market trackers, trading activity cooled significantly in November and the first week of December, raising fresh questions about demand heading into year end. Sales And Volume Plunge According to CryptoSlam, NFT sales fell to $320 million in November, down from close to $630 million in October. That level is roughly on par with the $312 million recorded in September 2024. Based on reports, the trend did not improve at the start of December: from Dec. 1–7, collections generated about $62 million in sales — the weakest weekly total recorded so far in 2025. Market participants are being hit by lower turnover and fewer big trades. Market Cap Shrinks Dramatically CoinGecko data shows the sector’s market cap sits at $3.1 billion, which is down 66% from a January high of $9.2 billion. Reports have disclosed a steep month-to-month swing as well: values dropped from $6.6 billion in October to $3.5 billion in November, a fall of 46% in roughly 30 days. There was a brief uptick on Nov. 11 when market cap moved from $3.5 billion to nearly $4 billion during a memecoin-driven surge, but the recovery was short-lived and the market cap later retreated back to $3.1 billion. These moves show that prices are still volatile and driven by bursts of speculative interest. Blue Chips Mostly Lose Ground Top collections were not immune. Based on reports, CryptoPunks fell about 12% over the past month. Bored Ape Yacht Club slid 8.5%, while Pudgy Penguins dropped 10.6% in the same period. Art-focused blue-chip works also fell: Chromie Squiggle lost 5.6%, Fidenza declined 14.6%, Moonbirds went down 17.9% and Mutant Ape Yacht Club slipped 13.4%. The biggest fall among major names came from Hypurr, which dropped 48%. Two Collections Show Gains Not every project followed the downward path. Infinex Patrons posted almost 15% rise in the last 30 days, and Autoglyphs outperformed the top ten with a 21% gain. These outliers were lifted by collector interest, and in some cases by the projects’ small supply or unique on-chain history. Still, such gains remain the exception rather than the rule.

    "title": "The Current Bitcoin Price Pump Will End In A Crash – Here’s When To Start Selling",
    "body": "Over the last few days, the Bitcoin price has fluctuated, but the most prominent moves have been upwards, going from below $90,000 to over $94,000. As expected, this rapid climb already has investors calling for a return of the bull run, but not everyone is convinced. For some, the current Bitcoin price momentum is most likely a bull trap, and crypto analyst Xanrox highlights this in a recent analysis, outlining the best level to start selling the digital asset. Why The Bitcoin Price Risks A Crash To $74,000 Xanrox’s analysis focuses on the bearish formations that have appeared on the Bitcoin price crash following the recent upward move. While many in the crypto community celebrate the rise above $90,000 again, the crypto analyst sounds an alarm that this is the time to go bearish on the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Why The Litecoin Price Could Stage A 33% Rally To $110 According to the analysis shared on the TradingView website, there has been a clear bear flag formation for the cryptocurrency. This bearish formation is visible on both the 12-hour chart and the 1-Day chart. Regardless, both of these charts point to one possible outcome, and that is an almost perfect textbook bear flag formation. In addition to the bear flag formation, Xanrox also highlights that there is a WXY corrective pattern inside the bear flag. Both of these point to a possible continuation to the initial downtrend that began after the Bitcoin price hit $126,000 back in October. As for how far the current rally could go, the crypto analyst sees it reaching as high as $96,000 before momentum runs out. This presents the “perfect” time to sell or enter a short as the price continues its decline. The target for this is an over 25% crash that will send the price going toward $74,000. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s Volume Explosion: Leading Meme Coin Barrels Ahead In This Metric The $74,000 target makes an appearance as it is a swing low from April 2024, meaning that crypto traders who are long on the digital asset would have their stop losses below it. Thus, this makes it an attractive point for market makers to push the price towards in order to clear significant liquidity. The timeframe for this to play out is placed over the next few weeks, riding out the end of 2025 and moving into January 2026. However, the swing low support at $74,000, if it holds up, could end up serving as the next bounce-off point for the Bitcoin price. Featured image from Pngtree 42, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "A new technical analysis shared by crypto analyst BitGuru on the social media platform X shows that Dogecoin is trading at an important price level that could set the stage for an upward shift. His chart shows a familiar structure forming at a major support level, one that has acted as the starting point for a previous rally in the year. The price action now developing is similar to this earlier setup, showing that Dogecoin may be preparing for another recovery move above $0.2. Dogecoin Returns To An Important Support Zone Dogecoin has spent the past few weeks trading between $0.13 and $0.15 without a clear path to bullish price action. This recent price action is an extension of a downturn that has been taking effect since mid-September from the $0.3 price level. Related Reading: Pundit Highlights The Condition That Will Trigger A 2,300% XRP Rally To $50 Notably, technical analysis of Dogecoin’s daily candlestick timeframe chart shows that the cryptocurrency is currently positioned on a significant historical support level, the same area that sparked previous rallies. This support is shown on the chart as between $0.139 and $0.141, the lower boundary of a wide accumulation zone, where price repeatedly stabilized before surging. Despite the broader market’s recent weakness, this price support range has held up. Price action in December has led to the creation of a few transition candles on the daily timeframe chart. This, in turn, has led to the creation of a higher low relative to the November breakdown, which had caused Dogecoin to break below $0.135. Dogecoin Daily Candlestick Chart. Source: @bitgu_ru On X Another notable feature highlighted by the analyst is the tight compression forming around Dogecoin’s candles. The chart shows a sequence of narrow movements, indicating that selling momentum has thinned out. BitGuru interpreted this as exhaustion from sellers, meaning the Dogecoin price is no longer displaying the heavy downward pressure seen in November. This type of narrowing range is expected to be the final stage of the downtrend and buyers are beginning to regain control. Buyers Begin To Step In, Mid-Range Target Next Early signs of buyer strength are now visible within this compressed zone. This is reflected in the price action in the past 24 hours, which has seen Dogecoin bounce from its intraday low of $0.14 and increase by 4.1%. That rebound is the first meaningful pushback from buyers after days of bearish activity. Related Reading: Here’s How High The Dogecoin Price Will Go Once The MACD Bullish Cross Happens The projected arrow in BitGuru’s chart points to the mid-range area around $0.188 as the first destination now that Dogecoin is rebounding from its support base. However, another higher price target is highlighted around $0.223 if Dogecoin completes its projected bounce from the support. Depending on how Dogecoin reacts here, a bullish move will target the order block around $0.25, before further price targets at $0.284 and $0.306.

    "title": "XRP Breakout Enters Critical Phase As Chart Targets $9–$13 Zone",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Cryptollica published a new XRP/USD 2-week chart on December 8 via TradingView, arguing that the altcoin may be replaying the same structural pattern that preceded its explosive 2017 rally. With current price action pivoting around the key $1.95 level and technical targets projected as high as $9–$13. What Happens If XRP Repeats The 2017 Fractal? The analysis uses a long-range log chart from Binance, where the latest candle in the screenshot shows XRP trading around $2.0892. In this timeframe, the analyst divides XRP’s history into mirrored cycles: 2014–2017 on the left and 2021–2025 on the right, each broken into labeled segments “Part 1,” “Part 2” and “Part 3.” Related Reading: XRP Selloff: Whales Shed Coins Worth $1 Billion In A Week According to Cryptollica, “the cycle experienced by XRP between 2014 and 2017 is almost an identical copy of the current cycle spanning 2021 to 2025.” In both cases, Part 1 is described as an accumulation phase, with XRP suppressed below a dashed blue resistance band for an extended period while forming higher lows along a rising dotted trendline. The current Part 1, roughly 2022–2024, is said to have lasted substantially longer than in the earlier cycle. The analyst cites the rule that “the bigger the base, the higher in space,” arguing that this extended sideways structure signals a large build-up of potential energy. Part 2 is defined as the breakout and retest of that blue resistance band. Once XRP closes decisively above this zone and consolidates there, the chart treats the area as a new support and as confirmation that “the official end of the downtrend and the start of a bull market” has been registered. Cryptollica suggests XRP is now at the final stage of, or has just completed, this breakout phase on the 2-week timeframe. The pivotal reference point for the entire setup is the $1.95 level, drawn in green on the chart. “The $1.95 level, marked in green, is of vital importance,” the analyst writes, emphasizing the classic principle that “once resistance is broken, it turns into support.” In this framework, XRP “currently holding above this level (performing a successful retest) is the most crucial confirmation point for the continuation of the uptrend.” Related Reading: Pundit Highlights The Condition That Will Trigger A 2,300% XRP Rally To $50 If that confirmation holds, the analysis moves to Part 3, labeled the “Parabolic Rise – Discovery Phase.” In 2017, this segment corresponded to a near-vertical advance that pushed XRP into its all-time high zone. Cryptollica argues that XRP now stands “right on the precipice of this ‘vertical lift-off’ in the current cycle,” illustrated by a steep yellow arrow on the logarithmic chart. The first major objective is the region around the prior all-time high at roughly $3.30–$3.84. If the 2017 fractal “plays out precisely,” the post projects an “implied target” between $9.00 and $13.00. The analyst tempers this with several cautions. The crypto market is far larger than in 2017, and a move to $10+ would imply a “colossal market capitalization,” making a repeat of the exact 2017 multiple “mathematically more challenging,” even if “logic often takes a backseat in crypto mania.” The scenario also assumes supportive fundamentals, including the resolution of regulatory overhangs, potential XRP ETF developments and Ripple’s stablecoin strategy. Parabolic phases, Cryptollica warns, are typically accompanied by “sudden drops of 30–40%,” making them “the most dangerous territory for leveraged trading.” The analyst characterizes the overall outlook as “extremely positive (bullish)” as long as the $1.95 support holds, concluding that XRP is at the moment of “breaking its chains” and that, if broader market conditions remain constructive, “double-digit targets ($10+) for XRP are technically on the table.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.07.

    "title": "More Details On The Wall Street $500 Million Investment In XRP",
    "body": "Ripple’s most recent funding round has become one of the biggest crypto-related deals of the year, mainly because of who joined in and how the deal was structured. According to details shared in Bloomberg’s report, major Wall Street names, including Citadel Securities, Fortress Investment Group, Brevan Howard, and Galaxy Digital, put $500 million into Ripple, giving the company a valuation of around $40 billion. This instantly turned the round into one of the strongest signs yet that traditional finance is taking a serious interest in the XRP ecosystem. How Wall Street Structured The Deal To Protect Themselves In early November 2025, Ripple closed a major private equity round that injected $500 million into the company, resulting in a valuation of roughly $40 billion. However, new details show that the most surprising part of the transaction is not the amount raised but the agreement behind it. Bloomberg reports that investors in this round did not simply buy Ripple shares and hope the value rises. Instead, they secured built-in protections that guarantee them profits later. Related Reading: Here’s The Level That XRP Price Must Reclaim To Trigger Another Surge They were given the right to sell their shares back to Ripple in three to four years at a 10% yearly return, unless Ripple goes public before then. At that rate, Ripple would need to pay roughly $732 million to buy the shares back after four years. That means even if Ripple’s valuation stays flat or drops, the investors still walk away with guaranteed gains. However, if Ripple decides to buy the shares back earlier, the investors get an even higher payout of around 25% annualized rate. A liquidation preference was also included, meaning these investors get paid first if anything goes wrong. Ripple noted in its announcement of the investment round that it has repurchased more than 25% of its outstanding shares over the past few years. Why The Deal Is Really A Bet On XRP Even though the investors bought equity in Ripple, not XRP itself, most of Ripple’s value still comes from its massive XRP holdings. According to Bloomberg, two of the funds that put in money noted that at least 90% of Ripple’s net value is tied to XRP. As of July 2025, Ripple held around $124 billion worth of XRP, although most of its XRP holdings are held in escrow. Related Reading: What’s Happening With XRP And Why Did Its Spot ETF Crash 20%? This means the investment round, in reality, is also a bet on XRP’s long-term relevance and future market strength. If the price of XRP grows, Ripple benefits, and so do the investors who now hold equity backed by a company sitting on one of the world’s largest digital asset reserves. However, the $500 million investment does show that serious investors believe Ripple will continue growing, but just that Ripple’s success is still directly linked to the XRP price.

    "title": "Solana Network Sees 68% Crash In 3 Years, What’s Going On?",
    "body": "The Solana network has seen its validator count crash by more than 68% over the past three years, falling from thousands of active nodes to just around 800. The massive decline in validators has sparked discussions about whether this could become a threat to the blockchain network or a natural pruning of inactive nodes to increase efficiency. Solana loses 68% Of Its Validators In 3 Years A new report from Criptonocias reveals that Solana has experienced a dramatic decline in the number of its validators, active and non-active, since March 2023. This decrease has raised concerns across the crypto community about the network’s overall health and security. Related Reading: Why Has The Solana Price Been Crashing Since October? This Major SOL Player Is Selling Over the last three years, the Solana network has steadily lost validators, going from 2,500 to 2,100 in November 2022 and now hovering around 800. This decline means the blockchain has lost a total of 1,700 validators. Although this considerable decrease should trigger warning alerts, it could be a result of ledger pruning, which involves removing inactive or redundant nodes to streamline a network and improve its performance without compromising security. Notably, validators are crucial for the operation of a blockchain network, as they run nodes, confirm transactions, and help maintain the integrity of the system. Each validator adds to the diversity of the network and reduces the risk of any single entity gaining excessive control. According to the report, some voices in the Solana ecosystem see the reduction of validators in a positive light. They argue that losing “Sybil validators,” which are nodes pretending to be multiple independent operators but are actually controlled by a single party, can be beneficial. Based on this perspective, having a smaller number of reliable and active validators is healthier than maintaining thousands of nodes that do not contribute meaningfully to the blockchain network. Criptonocias revealed that teams such as Layer 33, which develops infrastructure node tools and provides network services for Solana, point out that many of the validators leaving the blockchain are not Sybils but legitimate node operators. This suggests that the drop in numbers does not automatically equate to improved network quality despite widespread talks about ledge pruning. Notably, the potential impact on the Solana network, whether negative or positive, depends on the independence of the remaining validators and the distribution of power among them. An updated report of the validator count reveals that it has dropped again from 800 to 795. Solana Faces Liquidity Crunch As Profitability Declines Amidst its decline in validators, the Solana network is showing signs of strain as liquidity dries up and profitability declines. On-chain data from Glassnode highlights a troubling trend in the network’s trading activity, with the 30-day average realized profit-to-loss ratio remaining below 1 since mid-November. Related Reading: Solana Welcomes Bearish December, But Pundit Shares Possible Move To $170 This level is typically associated with bear market conditions and points to a growing imbalance between gains and losses among traders. A ratio below 1 also indicates that traders are realizing losses more frequently than profits, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s weakening market sentiment.

    "title": "Bitcoin’s Market Structure Strengthens Despite Slower Trading Activity — Here’s Why",
    "body": "Despite a noticeable cooldown in trading volumes, Bitcoin’s underlying market structure has continued to strengthen. The price action has stabilized within a narrow range as long-term holders maintain firm conviction. As more BTC flows into cold storage and supply on exchanges tightens, the market is transitioning from hype-driven swings to steady structural support. How The Price Compression Builds Energy For A Larger Move CIO and founder of MNFund and MNCapital, CryptoMichNL, emphasized that Bitcoin shares a strong correlation with the Nasdaq. While Nasdaq continues to show steady resilience, BTC has stalled behind. This mismatch creates a mispricing and market divergence, which is why the path toward $100,000 remains wide open and why the 4-year cycle thesis doesn’t hold up. Related Reading: Did 2025 Mark A Bear Market For Bitcoin? Predictions Point To A $150,000 Rally In 2026 Recently, BTC saw a massive correction, dropping from $115,000 to $80,000 in just two weeks. During that same liquidation period, what LVisserLabs calls the rotation between Pure Vol vs. Pure Profitability or Beta vs. Quality has fallen sharply. Beta here refers to high-volatility, high-beta stocks, which are essentially tech stocks that drive the markets. Meanwhile, Quality means more risk-off assets, including high-quality, profitable, and stable companies. Currently, BTC has stalled after the sell-off, and the Beta assets have recovered substantially, implying that the stocks have inverted their loss with the big drop and are now grinding upwards, signaling that risk-on appetite is clearly back. With this kind of structural divergence, it’s likely that in the coming weeks or months, BTC will grind upward to $110,000 and $115,000 levels, reversing the drop as the entire correction was a little dubious. CryptoMichNL advised that instead of relying on a time-based sounding the 4-year cycle assumption, it is better to focus on the charts and macro relationships that directly influence BTC price. On-Chain Activity Shows Clear Confidence From Big Money The ambassador of StandXOfficial and the KOL of Binance, who is also an advisor at KOLsAgency, Investor Ucan, has highlighted that the evidence of Bitcoin’s latest upward move is already on-chain. The last six hours have revealed a clear surge of institutional demand. On-chain data shows that Binance purchased 7,298 BTC, Coinbase bought 1,362 BTC, Wintermute bought 2,174 BTC, BlacRock bought 1,362 BTC, and an unknown whale bought 6,192 BTC. In total, 20,438 BTC were purchased in just six hours, valued at approximately $1.9 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Settles In Consolidation Zone – Levels To Watch Ucan noted that the timing of this purchase is what stands out. These inflows hit the market hours before the Federal Reserve’s upcoming employment data was released. Institutional is clearly expecting a supportive outcome. A positive print refers to easing expectations and fresh liquidity on the horizon. Retail traders are reacting, and the institutions are anticipating early. If the Fed confirms what these flows imply, today’s buying won’t look like simple momentum, but preparation. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "Crypto analyst Bull Theory has explained why the Bitcoin price has been crashing recently. The analyst pointed out that Wall Street traders were responsible for the price declines, indicating that these trading desks were manipulating the market for their own benefit. Analyst Explains Why The Bitcoin Price Is Crashing In an X post, Bull Theory blamed Jane Street for the Bitcoin price’s constant crash at 10 a.m. ET when the U.S. market opens. The analyst pointed out that BTC erased 16 hours of gains in just 20 minutes after the U.S. market opened. This has notably been happening since early November, when the flagship crypto fell below $100,000. Meanwhile, a similar price action also played out in the second and third quarters of this year. Related Reading: Confirming The Bitcoin Price Direction: Analyst Reveals What You Should Look Out For Bull Theory noted that another analyst, Zerohedge, has claimed that Jane Street is most likely the entity responsible for this Bitcoin price crash. The analyst stated that the chart shows a pattern that is too consistent to ignore, with a clean wipeout within an hour of the market opening, followed by a slow recovery. He added that this is classic high-frequency execution and that it fits Jane Street’s profile. Bull Theory stated that Jane Street is one of the largest high-frequency trading firms in the world and that they have the speed and liquidity to move markets for a few minutes. The analyst claimed that their behavior is simple: dump BTC at the market open, push the Bitcoin price into liquidity pockets, and then re-enter at a lower price. By doing this, the analyst claimed that Jane Street has accumulated billions in BTC. The trading firm is said to hold $2.5 billion worth of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, which is its 5th-largest position. Bull Theory added that this means most of the dump in the Bitcoin price isn’t due to macro weakness but manipulation by this entity. He expects that BTC will continue its upward momentum once these big players are done buying. Bitcoin At Risk Of A Decline Post-FOMC Crypto analyst Ali Martinez indicated that the Bitcoin price was at risk of a significant decline following today’s FOMC meeting. He pointed out that BTC has consistently reacted negatively to FOMC meetings, with six out of seven meetings this year leading to corrections for the flagship crypto.

The Bitcoin price had rallied to as high as $94,500 yesterday in anticipation of a third rate cut this year from the Fed. According to CME FedWatch, there is currently a 90% chance that the Fed will lower rates by 25 basis points (bps). A CryptoQuant report noted how these rate cuts have turned out to be a ‘sell the news’ event on the two occasions the Fed lowered rates this year, with the probability of this price action playing out again. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $92,600, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Outlook Post Fed’s 0.25% Rate Cut: Historical Patterns And Predictions",
    "body": "In a move that could signal a bullish shift for Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market, the Federal Reserve (Fed) announced a 25 basis points (bps) interest rate cut, bringing the new rate range to 3.5% to 3.75%. Bitcoin Poised To Surge Toward $100,000? Kevin Hassett, the White House economic adviser and a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair, commented to the Wall Street Journal CEO Council that there is “plenty of room” for additional interest rate cuts. He stated, “If the data suggests that we could do it, then — like right now, I think there’s plenty of room to do it.” Hassett, who is President Donald Trump’s preferred choice for the Fed chair position after Jerome Powell’s tenure concludes, has been critical of Powell for being “too late” in lowering rates. Related Reading: Crypto Market Structure Talks: Senator Lummis Addresses Latest Legislation Plans While the last rate cut in October had minimal impact on the Bitcoin price, analyst Michael van de Poppe believes that the current rate cut could significantly benefit the cryptocurrency. He characterized it as a “great move” for Bitcoin and noted that a breakout above $92,000 might be indicative of future bullish momentum. Van de Poppe expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s ability to maintain the support level between $91,500 and $92,000, suggesting that if it does, there could be a pathway for Bitcoin to approach the $100,000 mark. Can BTC Avoid Historical 10% Decline? Market expert Ash Crypto pointed out that historically, each of the last four times the Fed slashed rates by 25 bps, Bitcoin experienced a 5% to 10% decline shortly thereafter. Despite this pattern, Ash noted that the current market setup differs from previous scenarios, suggesting that different dynamics could be at play. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Climbs Toward $3,300 For The First Time Since November: What’s Driving The Surge? Several positive factors underpinning this optimism include the conclusion of quantitative tightening (QT) after a three-year period. Should Powell hint at the possibility of quantitative easing (QE) in his forthcoming remarks, it could spur a further bullish trend in the market. Additionally, with this being the third rate cut, Ash asserted that there is potential for increased liquidity to flow back into the markets, which historically benefits risk assets like Bitcoin.

    "title": "Market Stress Intensifies for Solana as Liquidity Drops to Cycle Lows and Volatility Builds",
    "body": "Solana’s (SOL) market structure is entering a tense phase, shaped by thinning liquidity, elevated leverage, and conflicting signals across institutional flows and derivatives markets. Related Reading: The Current Bitcoin Price Pump Will End In A Crash – Here’s When To Start Selling While price movements remain within familiar ranges, the underlying conditions paint a more complex picture, one that traders are watching closely for signs of either exhaustion or a sharp reversal. Recent sessions have seen Solana drift between $128 and $145, with brief rebounds lifting it toward the upper end of this range. However, liquidity indicators suggest a deeper reset is taking shape. Analysts note that these conditions often precede turning points, though they can amplify volatility in the short term. SOL's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview SOL Liquidity Drops to Bear-Market Levels On-chain data shows Solana’s 30-day realized profit-to-loss ratio has stayed below 1 since mid-November. This pattern, more losses being realized than gains, typically marks a liquidity contraction similar to historical bear-market phases. Analysts at Altcoin Vector describe the current setup as a “full liquidity reset,” a process that typically takes several weeks to resolve. That backdrop aligns with observations from SynFutures, whose team cites realized losses, declining futures open interest, and fragmented liquidity pools as contributing factors. Market-makers have also pulled back, thinning order books even as realized volatility increases. The effect is a market highly sensitive to sharp moves, particularly around key liquidation clusters. A notable risk is emerging around the $129 level, where nearly $500 million in long positions would be liquidated if the price retests that zone. With $15.6 million in SOL contracts wiped out in the last 24 hours alone, the market remains vulnerable to cascades. Similarly, exchange balances continue to drop, and spot ETFs have brought in more than $17 million this week, signaling accumulation despite broader stress. Volatility Builds as Derivatives and Spot Activity Diverge Derivatives data reflect a cautious but engaged trading environment. Open interest has climbed back above $7.2 billion, rising in tandem with a rebound in daily volume. This type of build-up during a quiet price phase often signals positioning ahead of a larger move. Long-to-short ratios have shifted bullish in recent days, and funding rates remain positive, although traders are becoming increasingly sensitive to macroeconomic catalysts. Spot markets tell a different story. Liquidity is thin, and deep-cycle reset metrics point to selling exhaustion rather than active expansion. This divergence, characterized by high derivative activity against weakening spot liquidity, typically precedes volatility spikes. Key Solana Levels Ahead as Market Awaits a Cycle Turn Technically, Solana remains stuck between established boundaries. The $145 resistance zone has capped multiple attempts to break higher, while support around $135 and deeper levels near $129 hold significance for traders monitoring liquidation risk. Momentum indicators are stabilizing, and the MACD is edging toward a potential positive crossover. Analysts note that past liquidity resets have been followed by rapid upside moves once conditions improved; however, the timing remains uncertain. Related Reading: NFT Slump Worsens With Monthly Sales Hitting Rock Bottom Currently, Solana sits at the center of a tug-of-war between cautious sentiment, thinning liquidity, and steady institutional flows. Whether these opposing forces resolve into a recovery or further volatility may depend less on price action alone and more on how quickly liquidity returns to the ecosystem.
