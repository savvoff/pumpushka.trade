    "title": "How XRP Is Approaching A Structural Break That Could Change Everything",
    "body": "After years of compression, XRP is quietly approaching a moment where the market will see a true structural break. This breakout is about a high-timeframe setup where market structure is on the verge of shifting. It is also the potential resolution of a multi-year structure that has compressed prices, absorbed supply, and conditioned participants to underestimate what comes next. Why Volatility Has Collapsed Ahead Of Expansion At the least expected time, XRP will print a legendary candle that will set a structural foundation and never move down. A crypto investor known as 24HRSCRYPTO noted on X that this move that is coming won’t be powered by retail hype, but by real economic activity on the XRP Ledger. When the altcoin begins to function as a settlement asset, volatility will become a liability, rather than a feature. Related Reading: Banks Could Favor A Higher XRP Price, Finance Expert Says Additionally, the payment rails, liquidity provisioning, and institutional settlement system will require price stability. A bridge asset referred to as a vehicle currency cannot swing 30-40% and still clear trillions in value. As volume and utility increase, XRP begins to transition from a speculative instrument into market infrastructure. Liquidity depth would be key to absorb shocks, while the price becomes anchored by demand. This is why the first candle isn’t a top, but the market repricing XRP’s role from a tradeable asset into a financial primitive. With new initiatives, XRP’s adoption is set to increase. Analyst X Finance Bull has revealed that RLUSD is the first US trust-regulated stablecoin launched by Ripple, issued natively on the XRP Ledger and extending across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains for broader institutional access. Any banks that would integrate with RLUSD will be automatically onboarded into the XRP rails. This isn’t just about stable payments, but about demand generation for the altcoin as the default bridge asset. From BlackRock funds flow to global repo markets, that’s where the real volume begins to flow. This flips the game, allowing RLUSD to provide the liquidity, while XRP captures the movement. Why XRPL Meets Institutional Due Diligence Standards For the first time, XRP Ledger has now processed over 4 billion transactions since its launch in 2012. Co-founder of Tedlabsio, a crypto trader and investor, Niels, has pointed out that the real-world usage across the network has sustained more than 13 years of uninterrupted operation. Related Reading: Here’s How Many Transactions XRP Must Process To Reach A $2,000 Price Tag The XRPL consistently handles around 1.5 million transactions per day, with regular peaks exceeding 5 million, and settles in 3 to 5 seconds. All of this happens at fractions of a cent per transaction. Over time, more than 13 million XRP have been burned in transaction fees, a metric that reflects continuous demand in network activity. This is why institutions pay attention to XRPL. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "$130 Million XRP Fumble: Analyst Reveals What Went Wrong",
    "body": "A crypto analyst has revealed how a well-timed XRP investment from the 2017 bull cycle turned into a missed $130 million opportunity, highlighting how execution failures can derail even the most promising strategies. The admission, shared publicly on X, has reignited debate over discipline, timing, and emotional control in long-term crypto investing. XRP’s Perfect Entry, Failed Exit The investment began with a disciplined entry. In early 2017, two participants collectively invested $1,200 into XRP at approximately $0.007, accumulating 171,428 tokens. From a market timing perspective, the entry was near optimal. XRP later surged during the cycle, briefly trading close to its peak and lifting the position’s value to roughly $770,000. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Bitcoin Make Or Break Level Amid Campaign For $90,000 At this stage, the trade had already achieved what most investors aim for: asymmetric upside realized within a single market cycle. However, the position was never exited. Despite clear signs of market euphoria and a dramatic expansion in price, the gains remained unrealized. The analyst later acknowledged that hesitation and emotional attachment prevented decisive action, effectively transforming a winning trade into a missed opportunity. This hesitation exposed a structural weakness in the strategy: there was no enforced exit discipline. While the entry was carefully planned, the decision to sell depended on the moments when emotional pressures are strongest and risk perception is most skewed. The scenario highlights a recurring issue in crypto markets, where many investors focus heavily on asset selection and timing entries, yet underestimate how psychologically demanding exits can be during periods of rapid price growth. The Missed Rotation And Compounding Effect Of Inaction The second failure compounded the first. The analyst explained that selling XRP near its peak would have freed capital to redeploy into Bitcoin while BTC traded around $1,000. That move could have converted the XRP proceeds into roughly 771 Bitcoin, effectively positioning the portfolio to benefit from the next major phase of the market cycle. Related Reading: Analyst Shares ‘Cold, Hard Truth’ For Bitcoin Investors As Price Struggles Holding those Bitcoin through later highs—approaching 170,000 CAD—would have resulted in total proceeds exceeding $130 million. The strategy was simple and systematic: take profits from an outperforming asset and rotate into another with asymmetric upside potential. It required no leverage, no complex instruments, and no precise market timing beyond a broad understanding of overall market cycles. However, hesitation, second-guessing, and attachment to the original position prevented decisive action. By delaying the rotation, the investor forfeited the compounding advantage, leaving the portfolio largely static while the broader market continued to advance. The analyst’s reflection highlights how the crypto market consistently rewards preparation and disciplined execution but punishes hesitation. This experience serves as a stark reminder that the ability to act decisively at critical moments is often the true determinant of long-term success in crypto investing.

    "title": "Why Has The Solana Price Been In A Steady Downtrend Since January?",
    "body": "Solana’s price action this year has followed a clear but uncomfortable pattern. After pushing to a new all-time high around the $296 region in January, the rally quickly lost momentum and transitioned into a steady decline that has persisted for months. Many traders have attributed this weakness to a risk-off sentiment across crypto, but a deeper on-chain breakdown shared by crypto analyst Ardi on X suggests the story began well before the January peak and has more to do with who was buying and who was quietly exiting. Distribution Was Already Underway Before The January Peak Solana has been on a clear downtrend since September, when it reached a lower high of around $247 compared to its January 19 all-time high of $293. One of the most important insights from Ardi’s analysis is that Solana’s January all-time high did not mark the start of distribution but rather the culmination of it. Related Reading: Why Has The Solana Price Been Crashing Since October? This Major SOL Player Is Selling The chart attached to his post shows that selling volume was already increasing months earlier, well ahead of October, meaning that large holders were positioning for exits long before price reached its final peak. From that perspective, the January high looks less like the beginning of a new expansion phase and more like the last push of a rally. After that point, price action began forming lower highs, and each rebound attempt lacked the strength needed to reclaim the all-time high. Interestingly, Solana failed to reach a new all-time high, even as other large market cap cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and BNB pushed to new all-time highs during the year. Another interesting feature of the data is the widening gap between retail behavior and that of larger players. Cumulative delta metrics on the chart show that retail-sized wallets have been consistently active throughout the year and are increasing their activity even as Solana’s price moved lower. On the other hand, mid-sized and institutional wallets tell a very different story. Their activity has been trending downward for months, starting from the January peak and extending up until the time of writing. Is Solana’s Price Becoming Dependent On Memecoin Activity? Ardi’s analysis also raises a broader question about what is currently driving demand for Solana. Outside of retail activity on Solana itself, one of the few consistent sources of activity has been the memecoin sector. Successes and booms of meme coins like Cat in a Dogs World (MEW), Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), which gained traction in the second half of 2024, contributed to Solana’s push to all-time highs during those periods. Related Reading: Will Solana Flip Ethereum? Revenue Numbers Show Disturbing Trend Those meme coin successes culminated with the launch of the Official Trump ($TRUMP) token in January 2025 on Solana, which experienced eye-watering gains shortly after its launch. This, in turn, contributed to Solana’s all-time high in January. However, since then, the TRUMP token and other Solana-based meme coins have been trending downwards in recent months and no longer command the same level of attention or trading intensity they had this time last year. That has led to the view that Solana’s price is increasingly sensitive to the success of memecoins in its ecosystem. At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $121.50, down by about 58.6% from its January all-time high of $293. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Ethereum Bearish Structure Meets Bullish Supply Signal – What Happens Next",
    "body": "Ethereum is facing renewed selling pressure as market uncertainty deepens and confidence continues to erode across the broader crypto landscape. After weeks of fragile price action and failed recovery attempts, ETH has struggled to attract sustained demand, pushing an increasing number of analysts to warn that the market may be entering the early stages of a bear cycle. Volatility remains elevated, sentiment is weak, and traders appear hesitant to commit capital as downside risks grow more pronounced. Related Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Inflows Collapse While Binance Retains Relative Activity – Details Recent on-chain and technical analysis from CryptoQuant highlights why concerns are mounting. Ethereum’s price structure has tightened into a descending triangle formation, a pattern that often emerges during periods of distribution rather than accumulation. Price remains capped below a well-defined downtrend line, while key moving averages continue to act as overhead resistance, limiting upside momentum. This compression reflects a market where sellers maintain control, even as prices attempt to stabilize. Historically, this type of technical setup increases the probability of a downside resolution. In Ethereum’s case, the $2,800 level has become a critical support zone. A sustained break below it would likely confirm a broader bearish continuation, potentially accelerating losses as stop orders are triggered. On-Chain Supply Tightening Challenges Ethereum’s Bearish Technical Outlook While Ethereum’s price structure continues to reflect stress, on-chain data is telling a more nuanced story. Analysis shared by CryptoOnchain highlights a sharp contraction in the amount of ETH available for immediate sale on major exchanges, particularly Binance. The Ethereum Exchange Supply Ratio on Binance has fallen to 0.032, its lowest reading since September 2024, pointing to a meaningful reduction in liquid supply despite ongoing price weakness. This drop suggests that market participants are moving ETH off exchanges and into self-custody, a behavior typically associated with longer-term positioning rather than imminent selling. In practical terms, fewer coins sitting on exchanges reduces the immediate sell-side pressure that often exacerbates downtrends. The timing is notable, as this supply contraction is unfolding while Ethereum remains locked in a bearish technical formation. The contrast between the chart and the on-chain data is becoming increasingly relevant. From a purely technical perspective, the descending triangle and persistent resistance argue for caution. However, shrinking exchange supply introduces the risk of a supply-driven move if demand stabilizes. Should buyers successfully defend the $2,800 support zone, even modest inflows could have an outsized impact on price due to reduced available liquidity. For now, the market sits at an inflection point. A decisive break above the downtrend line would strengthen the case that accumulation is taking precedence over distribution, potentially shifting the balance away from the prevailing bearish narrative. Related Reading: Gold & Silver Breakout While Bitcoin Chops: Why Capital Is Flowing Into Precious Metals Ethereum Consolidates as Bearish Structure Remains Intact Ethereum is trading around the $2,930 level on the daily chart, continuing to consolidate after an extended decline from its late-summer highs. The broader structure remains technically weak, with price still forming a sequence of lower highs and lower lows since failing to hold above the $4,500–$4,800 zone earlier in the cycle. This rejection marked a clear trend shift, transitioning ETH from expansion into a corrective and potentially distributive phase. From a trend perspective, Ethereum remains capped below its key daily moving averages. The faster moving average has rolled over sharply and continues to act as immediate resistance, while the 111-day and 200-day simple moving averages sit higher, converging in the $3,400–$3,600 range. This layered resistance suggests that any upside attempts are likely to face strong selling pressure unless momentum improves meaningfully. Related Reading: The Gold-to-Bitcoin Rotation Narrative Gains Strength: A Data-Driven Review Price action over recent weeks reflects indecision rather than recovery. ETH has been oscillating in a tight range between roughly $2,850 and $3,050. Indicating short-term stabilization but not a confirmed reversal. Volume supports this view, as selling spikes dominated the initial breakdown, while subsequent rebounds have lacked strong participation from buyers. Technically, the $2,800–$2,900 zone remains critical. Holding this area preserves the possibility of base-building, but a decisive breakdown would open the door to a deeper retracement. For structure to improve, Ethereum would need to reclaim the $3,200–$3,300 region and regain acceptance above its declining daily averages. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "A crypto analyst has identified a key support level that could determine whether the XRP price stabilizes or experiences a sharp sell-off, sending it crashing toward the $0.90 mark. With volatility building and market sentiment turning cautious, XRP’s next move may be critical for both short-term traders and long-term holders. XRP Price Faces Decline To $0.9 If Support Fails A crypto market expert who refers to himself as ‘Guy on the Earth’ on X has released an updated outlook on XRP, warning traders about a critical price level that could determine the cryptocurrency’s near-term direction. He noted that XRP has closed below the $1.95 monthly support zone for the first time in 13 months, signaling growing downside risk. According to his assessment, this breakdown could have serious technical implications if XRP fails to recover quickly. Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Will Shine In The New Year The analyst’s chart shows that this marks the second time XRP has fallen below the $1.95 support on the weekly timeframe. Guy on the Earth stated that the last time it happened was during April’s US tariff-related market stress, which caused XRP and the broader crypto market to crash. If history is any guide, the cryptocurrency could decline again if it fails to hold the $1.95 support level. The analyst has set the breakdown target at $0.90, which represents a more than 50% crash from current levels around $1.85. For the XRP price to stabilize, bulls must reclaim the $1.95 level and hold above it as soon as possible. Guy on the Earth noted that XRP recently attempted to move back above $1.95 but was rejected, forming another lower high and reinforcing its broader bearish structure. He added that if the monthly chart fails to reclaim this support within the next several days, XRP’s downside momentum could accelerate. For traders uncomfortable with the current setup, the analyst suggested reducing exposure and waiting for a confirmed daily close above $1.95 before re-entering the market. He explained that this strategy could help limit losses while keeping traders positioned for a potential price recovery. From a longer-term perspective, Guy on the Earth has identified several potential accumulation zones if XRP’s price continues to fall. The key levels to watch on the chart are $1.61, $1.42, and the $0.90 target, with $0.75 representing the initial breakdown area from the previous rally. The analyst further noted that increased selling pressure from Bitcoin could open the door to deeper downside moves for XRP. Analyst Confirms Bullish Recovery Still Possible Toward the end of his analysis, Guy on the Earth noted that the recent price action does not indicate a full-scale downturn for XRP. He explained that the cryptocurrency is less than $0.04 from the rectangle resistance and that Bullish Divergence has yet to play out across multiple timeframes. Related Reading: Peter Brandt Highlights Bearish XRP Price Chart, ‘You Need To Deal With It’ According to the analyst, a recovery and subsequent rally are still in the books for XRP, highlighting that sellers are becoming exhausted. Nevertheless, he warned that caution is necessary given XRP’s two consecutive weekly closes below key support. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Ethereum Fails To Surpass $3,000: Predictions For The Final Days Of The Year",
    "body": "The Ethereum price has struggled to reclaim the critical $3,000 mark for the past 48 hours, raising concerns about potential declines in the cryptocurrency’s value if this essential support level is not regained by the end of the week. Analyst Predicts Further Downside Market analyst Ted Pillows pointed out on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that without a quick recovery above $3,000, Ethereum could face further downside pressures, possibly dropping toward the $2,800 range in the near term. This scenario would indicate an additional retracement of approximately 5% from its current trading price, which hovers just above $2,940. This ongoing struggle adds to the 16% decline recorded in the monthly time frame, highlighting the precarious situation for broader cryptocurrency prices. Related Reading: This Friday’s Bitcoin Options Expiry Could Shake Up The Market: What To Look Out For Another analyst, Columbus, sought to understand Ethereum’s lackluster performance relative to Bitcoin (BTC). He noted that Ethereum continues to trade below its Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), struggling to gain traction above this critical metric. The bounce observed from the $2,800 to $2,850 range appears more responsive than impulsive, in the analyst’s words, suggesting that while there are buying interests, conviction in the rally remains weak. Columbus further remarked that there is considerable liquidity layered overhead, particularly within the $3,050 to $3,250 zone. This liquidity has successfully capped any attempts to push prices higher. Unless Ethereum can reclaim this area and achieve consistent acceptance above it, upward movements are likely to be more about short-term rotations into supply rather than genuine trend continuation. On the downside, a failure to hold the $2,850 mark could expose Ethereum to deeper losses, potentially leading to a downturn toward lower liquidity levels between $2,400 and $2,700, where the bulk of liquidity is concentrated. Will Ethereum Drop To $1,300 In 2026? Looking further into the future, market expert CryptoBullet painted a more somber picture of Ethereum’s potential trajectory for 2026. He has introduced a new fractal model for Ethereum that suggests bearish outcomes for investors anticipating a bull run next year. In a social media post, CryptoBullet presented a daily chart of Ethereum, outlining key price targets and indicating that while a price recovery might occur in January and February, subsequent months could see a significant downturn. Related Reading: These Five Key Drivers Could Boost XRP To $5 By 2026, Claims Top Analyst According to this analysis, Ethereum’s brief recovery could falter against existing resistance levels between $3,600 and $3,800, potentially culminating in a dramatic decline to a target price of $1,385. If this fractal model mimics Ethereum’s performance in 2022, it could signify a staggering 63% drop in value for the leading altcoin. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Whales Go Quiet On Binance As Inflows Collapse: Supply Shock Setup?",
    "body": "Bitcoin whale deposits to Binance fell sharply in December, a shift CryptoQuant framed as a constructive near-term signal because it implies less immediate sell-side supply moving onto the market’s biggest exchange venue. Bitcoin Selling Pressure Is Fading For Now CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost wrote on Dec. 24 that “the latest data shows a clear decline in Bitcoin inflows to Binance coming from whales over the month of December.” He said monthly whale inflows dropped from roughly $7.88 billion to $3.86 billion, “effectively being halved within just a few weeks,” calling it “a significant slowdown in BTC deposits to Binance by the largest holders.” The bullish read is mostly mechanical. Exchange inflows are not the same thing as selling, but they are a prerequisite for selling at scale, and Binance remains the dominant exchange in exchange-related flows in CryptoQuant’s framing. Darkfost put it plainly: “In the current environment, the observed trend remains constructive. Binance continues to capture the largest share of exchange-related flows. When inflows from influential participants such as whales decline on this platform, it generally suggests a reduction in their selling pressure.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trading Near ‘Fair Value,’ Says On-Chain Model He also cautioned that a downtrend in aggregate deposits does not eliminate the risk of sudden, market-moving transfers. “That said, this broader trend does not rule out the occurrence of occasional significant movements,” Darkfost wrote. “Some inflows can still impact the market, even if they remain relatively isolated.” As an example, he pointed to a recent $466 million spike across the 100 BTC to 10,000 BTC cohorts, alongside more than $435 million in inflows coming specifically from the 1,000 to 10,000 BTC range. Related Reading: The Macro Conditions For Bitcoin In 2026: Analyst Breaks Them Down Those bursts matter because they can reintroduce volatility even if the baseline is calmer. “These sudden movements are a reminder that whales retain the ability to influence volatility at any time, even within a broader slowdown,” Darkfost said, adding that when large holders “move thousands of BTC in single transactions,” they can trigger sharp moves “whether through sudden volatility spikes or deeper corrections, depending on the volumes deposited and potentially sold.” BTC Whale Capitulation On Pause A separate CryptoQuant update on Dec. 23 echoed the idea that the most acute stress may have eased. “Whale Capitulation on Pause,” the firm wrote, saying realized losses from “new whales” “significantly impacted the price drop from $124K to $84K.” Since the recent low, CryptoQuant said, those realized losses “have declined and are now flat.” Put together, the message is that one key source of near-term supply pressure,large deposits onto Binance,has cooled, while the realized-loss impulse tied to “new whales” is no longer intensifying. The caveat is the same one Darkfost emphasized: the market can look quiet in aggregate and still get rattled by a handful of large deposits if whales decide to move size again. At press time, BTC traded at $87,792. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Why The Current XRP Valuation Doesn’t Make Sense",
    "body": "Can a digital asset like XRP realistically sit at a few dollars if it is expected to serve as an important liquidity layer for the global financial system? That question is at the center of a growing debate around XRP’s market value and is the basis of comments shared on X by Jesse of Apex Crypto. His argument challenges the idea that XRP can function as a worldwide liquidity instrument through Ripple’s framework while maintaining a relatively low valuation around $3, which he says doesn’t make sense. The Liquidity Argument Behind XRP’s Valuation Debate XRP’s price history shows a clear ceiling that it has struggled to overcome. Since launch, the token has never sustained a move above the $4 level, with its highest recorded peak sitting around $3.65 in mid-July. Recent weeks have been even more challenging, as XRP has been trading under $2 with the entire crypto market going through a weak phase. Related Reading: $130 Million XRP Fumble: Analyst Reveals What Went Wrong Despite this, some bullish analysts continue to speculate about scenarios where the price revisits the $3 region. That outlook, however, was directly challenged by Jesse of Apex Crypto, who asserted that even a $3 valuation fundamentally misses the point of what XRP is designed to become. Jesse’s position is built around XRP’s intended role in global finance. According to him, if XRP grows into a primary liquidity source for cross-border settlements like it was intended to be, then a valuation around $3 would not align with that responsibility. In his video commentary, he questioned what XRP would ultimately be backed by or pegged to, pointing to a structure tied to vast pools of global financial assets. These include fiat currencies, potential central bank digital currencies, and even commodities such as gold or silver. He noted that such a framework would imply that the total value represented by XRP tokens would correspond to the combined value of these underlying assets. In simple terms, if roughly 100 billion XRP were expected to support or represent liquidity linked to trillions of dollars in global assets, then a single-digit price per token would appear mathematically inconsistent. From this perspective, XRP’s valuation would need to reflect the scale of the assets it helps move. Institutional Adoption Versus Price Reality The valuation debate is much more complex when placed alongside Ripple’s growing institutional footprint. Ripple has continued to expand partnerships with banks, payment providers, and financial institutions across multiple regions, which strengthens the case that its technology is gaining traction within traditional finance.

However, XRP’s market price has not mirrored this institutioacnal momentum. Even with XRP-related investment products gaining attention and steady inflows, the price action is still limited, and the cryptocurrency might continue trading at low valuations in the near term.

    "title": "Could XRP Make Trillionaires? Tech Firm Founder Thinks It’s Possible",
    "body": "According to reports, Joshua Dalton, founder of Triblu, has put forward a striking scenario: that XRP holders could become millionaires, billionaires, or even trillionaires if the token were used as part of a US strategic crypto reserve. Related Reading: JPMorgan Eyes Crypto Services As Institutional Demand Grows – A Boost For BTC Price? Dalton argued that XRP, because of its ties to a US-based company, is a safer fit for a national reserve than Bitcoin. The claim has energized some corners of the crypto community, but it also faces steep legal and market obstacles. Dalton’s Bold Claim And The Numbers Dalton’s case relies on hard math. Based on reports, the US national debt is about $38 trillion. Ripple’s escrow holds roughly 34.4 billion XRP. Using those figures, Dalton and others calculate that an XRP price near $883 would be needed to offset roughly 80% of that debt. Many people won’t like what I say below. “Bitcoin cannot be the official currency for the United States’ reserves because Satoshi Nakamoto is still unknown and it could be the currency operated by China. The government can 💯 trust XRP because it is operated by @Ripple and 💯… — Joshua Dalton (@J9Dalton) January 23, 2025 At present, XRP trades around $1.91. That would mean a rise of over 46,000% for the token. By comparison, Bitcoin is trading near $89,000 and would have to reach about $30 million per coin to meet a similar debt-offset goal if the plan focused on 1 million BTC, an idea once floated by US Senator Cynthia Lummis. That would be a gain of more than 33,000% from current levels. Legal And Market Limits US President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this year creating a national Bitcoin reserve and a wider crypto stockpile framework. But policymakers appear to be focused mainly on Bitcoin for the reserve role, with other coins treated as seizure assets or general holdings. Importantly, Ripple’s escrow is privately controlled and governed by contracts. It cannot be commandeered by a government without legal action and likely long court fights. Even if US authorities somehow obtained large amounts of XRP, unloading such a position on global markets would likely push the price down, not up. Markets are not built to absorb trillions of dollars without heavy distortion. Holders And Wealth Scenarios Based on wallet data, some XRP addresses would see big nominal gains at an $880 price. For example, a holder of 10,000 XRP — currently worth about $19,100 — could see that stake climb to nearly $9 million on paper. Reports show 179,546 wallets hold between 5,000 and 10,000 XRP. About 2,006 addresses sit between 500,000 and 1 million XRP. Yet most of the largest reserves are held by Ripple, its founders, or exchanges. Only 20 wallets contain between 500 million and 1 billion XRP, and six addresses hold more than 1 billion. 2026 is going to be epic! Locked in! XRP will be the star of 2026. — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) December 23, 2025 Market Reaction And Expert Views Matthew Sigel, lead researcher at VanEck, has argued in public that Bitcoin offers the best path to large-scale fiscal uses, and other analysts remain skeptical of any single token being used to “solve” national debt. Related Reading: XRP To $1,000? Korean Researcher Lays Out 10-Year Roadmap Coach JV and other commentators have shifted attention to 2026 as a potentially strong year for XRP price action, framing the outlook as speculative and time-bound. These views are primarily sentiment-driven and rely on factors beyond government policy, such as market demand and regulatory clarity. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from TradingView",
