    "title": "Solana Network Sees 68% Crash In 3 Years, What’s Going On?",
    "body": "The Solana network has seen its validator count crash by more than 68% over the past three years, falling from thousands of active nodes to just around 800. The massive decline in validators has sparked discussions about whether this could become a threat to the blockchain network or a natural pruning of inactive nodes to increase efficiency. Solana loses 68% Of Its Validators In 3 Years A new report from Criptonocias reveals that Solana has experienced a dramatic decline in the number of its validators, active and non-active, since March 2023. This decrease has raised concerns across the crypto community about the network’s overall health and security. Related Reading: Why Has The Solana Price Been Crashing Since October? This Major SOL Player Is Selling Over the last three years, the Solana network has steadily lost validators, going from 2,500 to 2,100 in November 2022 and now hovering around 800. This decline means the blockchain has lost a total of 1,700 validators. Although this considerable decrease should trigger warning alerts, it could be a result of ledger pruning, which involves removing inactive or redundant nodes to streamline a network and improve its performance without compromising security. Notably, validators are crucial for the operation of a blockchain network, as they run nodes, confirm transactions, and help maintain the integrity of the system. Each validator adds to the diversity of the network and reduces the risk of any single entity gaining excessive control. According to the report, some voices in the Solana ecosystem see the reduction of validators in a positive light. They argue that losing “Sybil validators,” which are nodes pretending to be multiple independent operators but are actually controlled by a single party, can be beneficial. Based on this perspective, having a smaller number of reliable and active validators is healthier than maintaining thousands of nodes that do not contribute meaningfully to the blockchain network. Criptonocias revealed that teams such as Layer 33, which develops infrastructure node tools and provides network services for Solana, point out that many of the validators leaving the blockchain are not Sybils but legitimate node operators. This suggests that the drop in numbers does not automatically equate to improved network quality despite widespread talks about ledge pruning. Notably, the potential impact on the Solana network, whether negative or positive, depends on the independence of the remaining validators and the distribution of power among them. An updated report of the validator count reveals that it has dropped again from 800 to 795. Solana Faces Liquidity Crunch As Profitability Declines Amidst its decline in validators, the Solana network is showing signs of strain as liquidity dries up and profitability declines. On-chain data from Glassnode highlights a troubling trend in the network’s trading activity, with the 30-day average realized profit-to-loss ratio remaining below 1 since mid-November. Related Reading: Solana Welcomes Bearish December, But Pundit Shares Possible Move To $170 This level is typically associated with bear market conditions and points to a growing imbalance between gains and losses among traders. A ratio below 1 also indicates that traders are realizing losses more frequently than profits, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s weakening market sentiment.

    "title": "Bitcoin’s Market Structure Strengthens Despite Slower Trading Activity — Here’s Why",
    "body": "Despite a noticeable cooldown in trading volumes, Bitcoin’s underlying market structure has continued to strengthen. The price action has stabilized within a narrow range as long-term holders maintain firm conviction. As more BTC flows into cold storage and supply on exchanges tightens, the market is transitioning from hype-driven swings to steady structural support. How The Price Compression Builds Energy For A Larger Move CIO and founder of MNFund and MNCapital, CryptoMichNL, emphasized that Bitcoin shares a strong correlation with the Nasdaq. While Nasdaq continues to show steady resilience, BTC has stalled behind. This mismatch creates a mispricing and market divergence, which is why the path toward $100,000 remains wide open and why the 4-year cycle thesis doesn’t hold up. Related Reading: Did 2025 Mark A Bear Market For Bitcoin? Predictions Point To A $150,000 Rally In 2026 Recently, BTC saw a massive correction, dropping from $115,000 to $80,000 in just two weeks. During that same liquidation period, what LVisserLabs calls the rotation between Pure Vol vs. Pure Profitability or Beta vs. Quality has fallen sharply. Beta here refers to high-volatility, high-beta stocks, which are essentially tech stocks that drive the markets. Meanwhile, Quality means more risk-off assets, including high-quality, profitable, and stable companies. Currently, BTC has stalled after the sell-off, and the Beta assets have recovered substantially, implying that the stocks have inverted their loss with the big drop and are now grinding upwards, signaling that risk-on appetite is clearly back. With this kind of structural divergence, it’s likely that in the coming weeks or months, BTC will grind upward to $110,000 and $115,000 levels, reversing the drop as the entire correction was a little dubious. CryptoMichNL advised that instead of relying on a time-based sounding the 4-year cycle assumption, it is better to focus on the charts and macro relationships that directly influence BTC price. On-Chain Activity Shows Clear Confidence From Big Money The ambassador of StandXOfficial and the KOL of Binance, who is also an advisor at KOLsAgency, Investor Ucan, has highlighted that the evidence of Bitcoin’s latest upward move is already on-chain. The last six hours have revealed a clear surge of institutional demand. On-chain data shows that Binance purchased 7,298 BTC, Coinbase bought 1,362 BTC, Wintermute bought 2,174 BTC, BlacRock bought 1,362 BTC, and an unknown whale bought 6,192 BTC. In total, 20,438 BTC were purchased in just six hours, valued at approximately $1.9 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Settles In Consolidation Zone – Levels To Watch Ucan noted that the timing of this purchase is what stands out. These inflows hit the market hours before the Federal Reserve’s upcoming employment data was released. Institutional is clearly expecting a supportive outcome. A positive print refers to easing expectations and fresh liquidity on the horizon. Retail traders are reacting, and the institutions are anticipating early. If the Fed confirms what these flows imply, today’s buying won’t look like simple momentum, but preparation. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "Crypto analyst Bull Theory has explained why the Bitcoin price has been crashing recently. The analyst pointed out that Wall Street traders were responsible for the price declines, indicating that these trading desks were manipulating the market for their own benefit. Analyst Explains Why The Bitcoin Price Is Crashing In an X post, Bull Theory blamed Jane Street for the Bitcoin price’s constant crash at 10 a.m. ET when the U.S. market opens. The analyst pointed out that BTC erased 16 hours of gains in just 20 minutes after the U.S. market opened. This has notably been happening since early November, when the flagship crypto fell below $100,000. Meanwhile, a similar price action also played out in the second and third quarters of this year. Related Reading: Confirming The Bitcoin Price Direction: Analyst Reveals What You Should Look Out For Bull Theory noted that another analyst, Zerohedge, has claimed that Jane Street is most likely the entity responsible for this Bitcoin price crash. The analyst stated that the chart shows a pattern that is too consistent to ignore, with a clean wipeout within an hour of the market opening, followed by a slow recovery. He added that this is classic high-frequency execution and that it fits Jane Street’s profile. Bull Theory stated that Jane Street is one of the largest high-frequency trading firms in the world and that they have the speed and liquidity to move markets for a few minutes. The analyst claimed that their behavior is simple: dump BTC at the market open, push the Bitcoin price into liquidity pockets, and then re-enter at a lower price. By doing this, the analyst claimed that Jane Street has accumulated billions in BTC. The trading firm is said to hold $2.5 billion worth of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, which is its 5th-largest position. Bull Theory added that this means most of the dump in the Bitcoin price isn’t due to macro weakness but manipulation by this entity. He expects that BTC will continue its upward momentum once these big players are done buying. Bitcoin At Risk Of A Decline Post-FOMC Crypto analyst Ali Martinez indicated that the Bitcoin price was at risk of a significant decline following today’s FOMC meeting. He pointed out that BTC has consistently reacted negatively to FOMC meetings, with six out of seven meetings this year leading to corrections for the flagship crypto. Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Shows Shocking Similarities To 2012-2015, But What Happened Last Time? The Bitcoin price had rallied to as high as $94,500 yesterday in anticipation of a third rate cut this year from the Fed. According to CME FedWatch, there is currently a 90% chance that the Fed will lower rates by 25 basis points (bps). A CryptoQuant report noted how these rate cuts have turned out to be a ‘sell the news’ event on the two occasions the Fed lowered rates this year, with the probability of this price action playing out again. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $92,600, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "In a move that could signal a bullish shift for Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market, the Federal Reserve (Fed) announced a 25 basis points (bps) interest rate cut, bringing the new rate range to 3.5% to 3.75%. Bitcoin Poised To Surge Toward $100,000? Kevin Hassett, the White House economic adviser and a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair, commented to the Wall Street Journal CEO Council that there is “plenty of room” for additional interest rate cuts. He stated, “If the data suggests that we could do it, then — like right now, I think there’s plenty of room to do it.” Hassett, who is President Donald Trump’s preferred choice for the Fed chair position after Jerome Powell’s tenure concludes, has been critical of Powell for being “too late” in lowering rates. Related Reading: Crypto Market Structure Talks: Senator Lummis Addresses Latest Legislation Plans While the last rate cut in October had minimal impact on the Bitcoin price, analyst Michael van de Poppe believes that the current rate cut could significantly benefit the cryptocurrency. He characterized it as a “great move” for Bitcoin and noted that a breakout above $92,000 might be indicative of future bullish momentum. Van de Poppe expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s ability to maintain the support level between $91,500 and $92,000, suggesting that if it does, there could be a pathway for Bitcoin to approach the $100,000 mark. Can BTC Avoid Historical 10% Decline? Market expert Ash Crypto pointed out that historically, each of the last four times the Fed slashed rates by 25 bps, Bitcoin experienced a 5% to 10% decline shortly thereafter. Despite this pattern, Ash noted that the current market setup differs from previous scenarios, suggesting that different dynamics could be at play. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Climbs Toward $3,300 For The First Time Since November: What’s Driving The Surge? Several positive factors underpinning this optimism include the conclusion of quantitative tightening (QT) after a three-year period. Should Powell hint at the possibility of quantitative easing (QE) in his forthcoming remarks, it could spur a further bullish trend in the market. Additionally, with this being the third rate cut, Ash asserted that there is potential for increased liquidity to flow back into the markets, which historically benefits risk assets like Bitcoin.

    "title": "Market Stress Intensifies for Solana as Liquidity Drops to Cycle Lows and Volatility Builds",
    "body": "Solana’s (SOL) market structure is entering a tense phase, shaped by thinning liquidity, elevated leverage, and conflicting signals across institutional flows and derivatives markets. Related Reading: The Current Bitcoin Price Pump Will End In A Crash – Here’s When To Start Selling While price movements remain within familiar ranges, the underlying conditions paint a more complex picture, one that traders are watching closely for signs of either exhaustion or a sharp reversal. Recent sessions have seen Solana drift between $128 and $145, with brief rebounds lifting it toward the upper end of this range. However, liquidity indicators suggest a deeper reset is taking shape. Analysts note that these conditions often precede turning points, though they can amplify volatility in the short term. SOL's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview SOL Liquidity Drops to Bear-Market Levels On-chain data shows Solana’s 30-day realized profit-to-loss ratio has stayed below 1 since mid-November. This pattern, more losses being realized than gains, typically marks a liquidity contraction similar to historical bear-market phases. Analysts at Altcoin Vector describe the current setup as a “full liquidity reset,” a process that typically takes several weeks to resolve. That backdrop aligns with observations from SynFutures, whose team cites realized losses, declining futures open interest, and fragmented liquidity pools as contributing factors. Market-makers have also pulled back, thinning order books even as realized volatility increases. The effect is a market highly sensitive to sharp moves, particularly around key liquidation clusters. A notable risk is emerging around the $129 level, where nearly $500 million in long positions would be liquidated if the price retests that zone. With $15.6 million in SOL contracts wiped out in the last 24 hours alone, the market remains vulnerable to cascades. Similarly, exchange balances continue to drop, and spot ETFs have brought in more than $17 million this week, signaling accumulation despite broader stress. Volatility Builds as Derivatives and Spot Activity Diverge Derivatives data reflect a cautious but engaged trading environment. Open interest has climbed back above $7.2 billion, rising in tandem with a rebound in daily volume. This type of build-up during a quiet price phase often signals positioning ahead of a larger move. Long-to-short ratios have shifted bullish in recent days, and funding rates remain positive, although traders are becoming increasingly sensitive to macroeconomic catalysts. Spot markets tell a different story. Liquidity is thin, and deep-cycle reset metrics point to selling exhaustion rather than active expansion. This divergence, characterized by high derivative activity against weakening spot liquidity, typically precedes volatility spikes. Key Solana Levels Ahead as Market Awaits a Cycle Turn Technically, Solana remains stuck between established boundaries. The $145 resistance zone has capped multiple attempts to break higher, while support around $135 and deeper levels near $129 hold significance for traders monitoring liquidation risk. Momentum indicators are stabilizing, and the MACD is edging toward a potential positive crossover. Analysts note that past liquidity resets have been followed by rapid upside moves once conditions improved; however, the timing remains uncertain.

Whether these opposing forces resolve into a recovery or further volatility may depend less on price action alone and more on how quickly liquidity returns to the ecosystem.

    "title": "America’s Largest Banks Quietly Embrace Bitcoin Loans, Saylor Says",
    "body": "Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy, told attendees at Binance Blockchain Week that the wall of skepticism inside big banks is breaking down faster than he once expected. Related Reading: All-In On XRP: Why This Leading Investor Sold His Entire Bitcoin Stack He said he had thought it might take four to eight years for major financial firms to move fully into Bitcoin. Now, he says, that timeline is compressing and the shift is visible right away. Banking Giants Reverse Course According to Saylor, the past 12 months have seen heavy hitters — including Citibank, BNY, Bank of America, PNC, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Vanguard — shift from hostility to a more welcoming stance on crypto. Reports have disclosed that Vanguard has enabled clients to trade ETF shares linked to XRP and Bitcoin through its platform. Saylor added that internal plans are in motion at several institutions to roll out custody services and credit lines tied to crypto holdings. Loans Backed By Bitcoin Based on Saylor’s remarks, Charles Schwab is preparing to offer Bitcoin custody and to extend credit against BTC as soon as next year, and Citibank is said to be moving in a similar direction. He recalled earlier struggles to secure bank loans using Bitcoin as collateral and said lenders have flipped their approach within roughly six months. According to him, eight of the top 10 US banks are now issuing credit backed by Bitcoin, a claim that highlights how quickly attitudes appear to be changing inside the industry. Political Climate Could Be Speeding Things Up Saylor pointed to policy shifts under US President Donald Trump as a factor that has encouraged banks to leave the sidelines. Many firms were already experimenting with blockchain years ago — Goldman Sachs, for example, issued one of the first Bitcoin-backed loans in 2022 — but a friendlier regulatory tone, he said, has accelerated planning and product development. Still, banks face legal, operational and risk hurdles before these services reach broad retail customers. Markets Watching Fed Announcement Meanwhile, traders and analysts are watching the Federal Open Market Committee. The Fed is expected to cut rates by 0.25%, bringing the target to 3.5%–3.75%, a move that often boosts risk assets like Bitcoin. Volatility is likely around the announcement, and some market players warn that early rallies can reverse quickly when the Fed provides forward guidance.

The crypto fear gauge hit 10 this week, signaling extreme fear, and price rebounded from $86,700 to roughly $92,300. One analyst flagged resistance near $94,200 and suggested a clean breakout could open a path toward $103,000. Another observer noted Bitcoin has lagged the Nasdaq’s recovery, a divergence that could work in either direction if markets shift. Featured image from The Information, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Ethereum Should Be Valued Like Amazon, Says Dragonfly’s Qureshi",
    "body": "Dragonfly managing partner Haseeb Qureshi has sharpened his defense of Ethereum’s valuation, arguing that critics are using the wrong financial framework and that ETH should be analyzed more like an early-stage Amazon than a mature “value” stock. Speaking on the Milk Road Show on 9 December 2025, Qureshi revisited his now-viral valuation clash with investor Santiago “Santi” Santos, hosted by ThreadGuy, which reignited the debate over how to price layer 1 blockchains. At the core of Qureshi’s thesis is a simple but controversial claim: fee revenue on Ethereum is effectively pure margin and should be treated as profit, not as “revenue” in the traditional corporate sense. “Blockchains don’t have revenue. They have profit,” he said. “When chains charge fees, that’s profit. There’s no expenses for a chain. Chains don’t pay expenses, right? There’s no AWS hosting cost for Ethereum.” Qureshi Pushes Back On Claims Ethereum Is Overvalued Santos had argued that Ethereum is trading at “300 plus” times sales, calling these price-to-sales (P/S) levels “embarrassing” relative to traditional companies and suggesting valuations are “way ahead of their skis.” Qureshi did not contest the magnitude of the multiples but rejected P/S as the right lens. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Largest Binance Inflow Since 2023 – Warning Sign? “He was insisting in the debate that the right way to look at these things is price of sales. So if you look at price sales for Ethereum, it’s something like 380. If you look at Amazon, I think Amazon topped out at price of sales of 42. And this was during the bubble,” Qureshi said. He countered that for a blockchain, what equity investors would call “sales” is closer to the GDP or GMV of the on-chain economy, which is not directly measured at the protocol level. The only clean, observable line is fee income, which he treats as net income. “The sales in some sense is like the GDP of the blockchain which we’re not measuring,” he argued. “The right thing to understand for a chain is the profit… The right thing to understand is what is the profit of Ethereum relative to the profit of Amazon.” That opens the door to the Amazon analogy. Qureshi emphasized that Amazon delayed profitability for almost two decades to prioritize growth, yet public markets still assigned it extremely high earnings multiples. “Amazon literally made no profit, no profit until basically about 20 years in as a business,” he said. “In the year I think it was 2013… Amazon had a PE ratio… over 600 whereas today the PE ratio of Ethereum of course is something like 380.” Because Ethereum’s P/S and P/E converge under his “fees = profit” assumption, Qureshi’s argument is that investors should compare ETH’s 300–380x multiple to Amazon’s P/E history, not to its much lower P/S, if they are going to use a single headline ratio at all. The broader context, he stressed, is that Ethereum and other L1s are still in an exponential build-out phase, more akin to early internet or e-commerce infrastructure than to late-cycle dividend payers. Related Reading: Ethereum Inches Toward A Critical Decision Point: Bullish Break Or Deeper Dive? “This technology has been getting bigger and bigger over time. It’s gobbling up the entire world of finance from where it started,” he said, referencing his essay “In Defense of Exponentials.” “None of [these technologies] started printing a bunch of profit immediately in the first five or even 10 years.” Despite choppy price action and underperformance of altcoins versus AI equities and gold, Qureshi said his conviction in the long-dated Ethereum thesis has increased, not weakened, through the public debate. “If anything, I have become more confident in my view,” he said, adding that nothing material had changed in the last months to justify a major portfolio rethink. “What exactly has changed in the last 2 months between, you know, ETH going to like $4,800 and ETH being at $3,000? The answer is basically nothing.” Shared some post-debate reflections on my L1 debate with @santiagoroel, my rebuttal against the “crypto is all a big casino” doomers, and where I think we are in the crypto macro cycle 👇 https://t.co/9uMJFuLVrX — Haseeb ＞|＜ (@hosseeb) December 9, 2025 For Qureshi, a genuine repositioning would require a clear invalidation of core assumptions—such as a quantum break of cryptography or a structural collapse in on-chain stablecoin demand. Short-term swings, in his view, are simply the pendulum of sentiment moving around a still-fixed fundamental anchor. His message to skeptics is that if markets tolerated Amazon at 600x earnings while it scaled into a dominant platform, dismissing Ethereum at roughly 300–380x on a “too high on P/S” argument alone is analytically inconsistent. At press time, ETH traded at $3,325. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "On-chain data shows the Solana Realized Profit/Loss Ratio has dipped into the loss-taking zone recently, a sign that SOL liquidity has thinned. Solana Liquidity Back At Levels Associated With Bear Markets According to data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, Solana liquidity has recently contracted to levels that are typically witnessed in a bear market. There are many ways “liquidity” of a cryptocurrency can be assessed, but here, Glassnode has used the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio. Related Reading: Bitcoin In An Opportunity Zone? Hash Ribbons Flash New Buy Signal This indicator measures, as its name already implies, the ratio between the amount of profit and loss that the SOL investors as a whole are realizing through their transactions. The metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin being sold on the network to see what price it was last moved at. If the previous transaction price was less than the latest selling price for any token, then the indicator considers its sale to have realized a net gain. Similarly, the metric adds transactions to the loss-taking category in the opposite case. The exact amount of profit or loss realized in any transfer is naturally equal to the difference between the latest price and last selling value. The indicator adds up this value for both categories and determines the ratio. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the Solana Realized Profit/Loss over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Solana Realized Profit/Loss witnessed a sharp spike during the price rally in September. This suggests that profit taking saw an explosion. The indicator maintained at high levels for a while, but following the price peak in October, its value went downhill fast. In November, the Realized Profit/Loss breached below the 1 mark as SOL plummeted. A value less than 1 on the metric implies loss realization is outpacing profit taking. Since this breakdown, the indicator has only gone lower inside the loss-taking region, a sign investor capitulation has only been becoming more dominant. Glassnode has noted that the trend signals “liquidity has contracted back to levels typically seen in deep bear markets.” During the 2022 bear market, Solana remained in these conditions for a few months before its price found a bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin Speculation Muted: Glassnode Analyst Calls Perps A ‘Ghost Town’ It now remains to be seen whether the low liquidity will also persist for the cryptocurrency this time, or if the fall into the loss region is only a temporary one for the indicator.

BTC started a downside correction and traded below the $92,000 support. There was a clear move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $87,777 swing low to the $94,583 high. Besides, there was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $91,600 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin is now trading below $91,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . The price is now approaching the $89,500 support, and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $87,777 swing low to the $94,583 high.

The importance of the area is highlighted by the token’s price action: it has spent much of Q4 2025 below that range, and at the time of reporting SHIB was trading around $0.000008618. That places the coin roughly 33–38% below the $0.000013–$0.000014 region that many traders watch as critical. $SHIB Dead unless it reclaims red. pic.twitter.com/LOllFuyPYv — Nebraskangooner (@Nebraskangooner) December 9, 2025 Technical Traders See Trouble Ahead Breaking a long-held support level often flips buying interest into resistance, and that scenario is what traders fear here. Based on reports from market commentators, a failure to climb back into the red band would make upward moves harder and likely sap momentum. Gooner used blunt language, saying “Dead unless it reclaims red” unless the token reclaims the zone. The phrase was repeated widely, feeding both bearish calls and pushback from supporters. Community Response And Roadmap Calls Across social threads, many users argued that SHIB is not unique; several altcoins appear stalled in the current phase. A number of holders said SHIB’s recovery chances may hinge on a wider altcoin rebound, sometimes called altcoin season. According to Zach Humphries, members of the Shiba Inu project must refocus every ecosystem initiative around SHIB, reposition the token to attract renewed retail interest, and publish a clear, actionable roadmap to restore earlier momentum. Bitcoin’s Role In A Possible Comeback Some analysts pointed to Bitcoin as the likely spark for any broad recovery, expecting the alpha coin to rebound toward $125,000 from around $90,000, while others have projected a new peak near $150,000 in 2026. If Bitcoin climbs above $100,000, traders say speculative flows could return and lift meme tokens including SHIB.

Many market observers emphasize that a return into the highlighted $0.000014–$0.00001 area would improve technical odds for a rally. At the same time, others warn that even with historical liquidity and a large community, reclaiming a broken support is often difficult and can take time. The coming weeks will likely test whether market-wide momentum or renewed project direction can change SHIB’s path. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Strategy Calls For Withdrawal Of MSCI’s Exclusion Plan For Digital Asset Treasury Companies",
    "body": "Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has expressed strong opposition to a proposal by the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) to exclude digital asset treasury companies (DATs) from its indexes. Calls For Fair Treatment Of Digital Asset Companies In a recent letter signed by Michael Saylor and the firm’s CEO Phong Le, Strategy highlighted its support for MSCI’s efforts to establish consistent eligibility criteria across its indices. However, the company criticized the proposed threshold for excluding firms with more than 50% digital assets on their balance sheets, calling it “misguided.” The company argued that this measure could have negative implications not only for Strategy’s operations but also for the broader cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Expert Declares Bitcoin Has Reached Midpoint Of Bear Cycle: What Lies Ahead? Strategy emphasized that, unlike traditional investment funds, it maintains the operational agility to adapt its value-creation strategies in tune with the evolving technology underlying Bitcoin. The firm asserts that this flexibility is a critical asset for investors and distinguishes Strategy and other DATs from traditional digital asset investment vehicles. The firm likened its investment approach in a singular asset class to that of real estate investment trusts (REITs) or oil companies, stating that MSCI categorizes those entities correctly without labeling them as investment funds. Therefore, it argued, DATs should be afforded similar treatment. ‘Discriminatory And Arbitrary’ The letter criticized the proposed 50% digital asset threshold as “discriminatory and arbitrary,” suggesting that it imposes uniquely unfavorable conditions on digital asset companies while allowing other industries—like oil, timber, and real estate—to maintain concentrated asset holdings without similar scrutiny. Strategy raised concerns that enforcing this rule would necessitate MSCI to create new methods for measuring balance sheet concentration, complicating the indexing process unnecessarily due to varying accounting principles across asset classes and jurisdictions. Additionally, Strategy elaborated on how the exclusion of DATs could substantially inhibit innovation within the digital asset industry, which the current administration strongly promotes as part of its economic strategy. The company said that digital assets like Bitcoin have the potential to become foundational elements of global financial systems, but the proposed measures could limit access to these transformative technologies for pension plans and 401(k)s, ultimately redirecting billions away from the sector. Strategy cautioned that a hasty exclusion of DATs could be based on misconceptions about their business models, asserting that it reflects a misunderstanding of the nature of these entities. The firm advocated for a more measured approach similar to MSCI’s past handling of the “Communication Services” sector, which underwent extensive consultation and a thorough review before reorganizing traditional telecom, media, and internet companies. Strategy Urges MSCI To Reconsider If implemented, Strategy warns that MSCI’s proposal could lead to the delisting of numerous companies heavily involved in digital assets. JPMorgan analysts estimate that Strategy alone might face liquidations of up to $2.8 billion as a direct consequence of this exclusion. Such a move is also expected to potentially distort market dynamics by incentivizing Bitcoin miners to sell their assets immediately instead of holding them as part of their business strategy. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Climbs Toward $3,300 For The First Time Since November: What’s Driving The Surge? In light of these concerns, Strategy urged MSCI to withdraw the proposal for excluding companies with over 50% digital asset holdings from its Global Investable Market Indexes. The firm asserted that the proposal is rooted in a flawed understanding of DATs and would impose conditions unaligned with national interests, particularly those advocating for the responsible growth of the digital asset space. As of this writing, the company’s stock, trading under the ticker symbol MSTR, is trading at $185.

    "body": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Realized Cap Growth indicator has continued to decline recently, a sign new capital inflows lack momentum. Bitcoin Realized Cap Growth Has Been Heading Down Recently As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the Bitcoin Realized Cap Growth has been trending lower recently. The “Realized Cap” is an on-chain capitalization model for BTC that calculates its total value by assuming the value of each individual token is equal to the spot price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. Related Reading: Solana Enters Bear Territory: Realized Loss Now Outweighs Profit This is unlike the usual market cap, which simply calculates the total valuation of the asset by multiplying the number of tokens in circulation with the current spot price, considering the latest value of the cryptocurrency to be the one value for all coins. In short, what the Realized Cap represents is the amount of capital that the Bitcoin investors as a whole used to purchase the asset’s supply. On the other hand, the market cap is the value that the investors are carrying in the present. The Realized Cap itself isn’t the indicator of interest in the current discussion, but rather the Realized Cap Growth, measuring the 365-day changes occurring in the Realized Cap. Changes in the indicator naturally reflect the amount of capital exiting or entering the cryptocurrency. In other words, the Realized Cap Growth contains information about the asset’s netflow. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the 7-day and 59-day moving averages (MAs) of the Bitcoin Realized Cap Growth over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Cap Growth has witnessed both its 7-day and 59-day MAs reverse down recently, with the former line crossing under the latter. The trend indicates that growth in the Realized Cap has been slowing down during the recent market downturn. “This suggests Bitcoin is lacking momentum from new cost basis inflows,” noted the analyst. With the 7-day MA falling below the 59-day MA, the indicator is now flagging the current market to be in a “bear phase.” The last time this signal maintained for an extended duration was alongside BTC’s decline over the first few months of 2025. It now remains to be seen how long momentum from new capital inflows will stay weak for Bitcoin this time around. Related Reading: Bitcoin In An Opportunity Zone?

Short-term holders (STHs) are defined as the Bitcoin buyers who got into the market during the past 155 days. Despite the rebound BTC has seen since its November low, STHs are still in a loss of 10%. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $92,400, down 1.5% over the last 24 hours. Featured image from Dall-E, CryptoQuant.com, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Crypto Tanks After Fed Cut: Santiment Breaks Down The Trap",
    "body": "Crypto markets lurched lower after the Federal Reserve delivered exactly what everyone said they wanted: the third straight 25bps cut to close out 2025. Santiment’s latest deep dive makes a simple, slightly uncomfortable point: retail treated it as a green light, whales treated it as exit liquidity. Bitcoin shortly rallied to $94,044, Ether surged to $3,433, XRP hit $2.10 and Solana managed to reach $142, but the momentum was short-lived. The BTC price fell by more than 5% at one point, ETH even fell by more than 8.5%. What Caused The Crypto Market Plunge? On 11 December, the FOMC confirmed another quarter-point reduction, completing what Santiment calls the “trifecta of cuts at the end of 2025.” Lower rates mean cheaper borrowing, more risk-taking, and—on paper—a friendlier backdrop for crypto. The Fed still describes an economy growing at a “moderate” pace with inflation above target, and in both the October and December meetings it cut because “the balance of risks (like slowing job growth) supported easing policy.” Related Reading: Will The Crypto Market Benefit From The Trump Fed Takeover? The key shift is liquidity. On 29 October, the Fed decided to slow the reduction of its securities holdings from 1 December, easing the pace of balance-sheet runoff. By 10 December, it went further, saying bank reserves had fallen “too much” and announcing renewed purchases of short-term Treasury bills to keep reserves “ample.” That is a move from shrinking the balance sheet to quietly adding money back into the system. As Santiment notes, the Fed is still data-dependent but clearly more willing to lean dovish to protect financial conditions. Markets, however, front-ran the story. Prediction platform Polymarket showed an “overwhelming amount of optimism” in the hours before Jerome Powell spoke. At the same time, on-chain data flagged abnormal activity: @DeFiTracer spotted a whale selling roughly 100 million dollars’ worth of Bitcoin within an hour, triggering “a healthy mix of sensationalized panic.” The expected outcome—another cut—arrived, but positioning around it was anything but balanced. Bitcoin’s price reaction looked bullish at first. BTC spiked to about $94,044 after the announcement. Yet Santiment’s social data shows that the positive-versus-negative commentary ratio for Bitcoin had already peaked well before Powell’s remarks. The crowd’s emotional high came in anticipation; when the actual rally hit, traders were “quite modestly reactive” despite the move to 94K. Sentiment was spent. Ethereum was worse. Over the same 24-hour window, ETH surged to around $3,433, and the positive comment ratio “was a LOT more interesting.” Santiment describes “a lot of FOMO after a mini surge immediately after Powell spoke,” with many traders who bought the breakout “eventually [getting] burned when ETH fell back down to 3,170.” It is the textbook “buy the rumor, sell the news” pattern: bullish macro headline, short-term bearish price action, retail buying the spike while larger holders “gladly” offload into the mini-rally. Related Reading: Crypto Market Structure Talks: Senator Lummis Addresses Latest Legislation Plans Structurally, though, the report is not outright bearish. Year-to-date, Santiment notes, Bitcoin is down about 3.6%, versus a 17.6% gain for the S&P 500 and a striking 61.1% for gold. “It’s quite the dramatic difference,” the team writes, arguing that “a regression to the mean for BTC would be justified.” With three cuts now locked in and reserves being topped up via T-bill purchases, the “catch-up” case for crypto versus equities and metals “becomes even stronger.” Historically, crypto “has reacted later than equities or commodities when macro trends shift.” On-chain, so-called smart money appears to be acting as if that delayed reaction is coming. Wallets holding 10–10,000 BTC have added 42,565 Bitcoin since 30 November. What is “still [remaining],” Santiment says, is “a notable dump from retail, which would be indicative of the perfect recipe for a major bull run.” For now, they expect smaller traders to “run on fumes from this positive news of rates getting cut, for at least a couple of days.” The bottom line of the report is deliberately sober. The final FOMC decision of 2025 “reinforces a narrative of gradual easing, improving liquidity, and a cautiously supportive environment for risk assets.” After a rough year, “ending the year with three consecutive rate cuts from the Fed is a strong sign.” If inflation drifts toward target and economic data stays stable, Santiment argues, 2026 could finally give digital assets “the breathing room they’ve been waiting for.” Just do not confuse that with an invitation to chase the first post-Fed spike—because, as this week just reminded everyone, that is still where crypto tourists go to get burned. At press time, the total crypto market cap was at $3.04 trillion. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood says Bitcoin’s long-running four-year pattern may be losing its grip as big financial players buy and hold more of the supply, a shift that could tame price swings and change how investors plan ahead. Related Reading: Institutions Scoop Up 9,000 Ether, Fueling Bullish Signals Institutional Buying Is Changing Markets According to Wood, large firms and spot ETFs are slowly locking up coins that used to flow in and out of retail hands. The most recent halving, on April 20, 2024, cut the miner reward to 3.125 BTC. On a daily basis, that reduction translated to about a 450 Bitcoin drop in supply each day, a figure some analysts call small compared with the trillions attributed to the market’s value and the billions moving into ETFs. Ark has been active too, buying shares in Coinbase, Circle and its own Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), a signal that institutional demand is more than a rumor. Cycle Rules Are Being Questioned Based on reports from banks and crypto firms, the familiar cycle—rises tied to halvings followed by deep crashes of 75–90%—is under debate. Standard Chartered cut its 2025 price forecast from $200,000 to $100,000, arguing ETF inflows weaken the halving’s price punch. Bitwise’s Matt Hougan and CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju have said institutional flows have changed or even erased the classic rhythm. Markets hit a peak near $122,000 in July, and some analysts now say future drawdowns may be shallower, in the 25% to 40% range rather than the extreme collapses seen earlier. Market Structure Still Shows Old Patterns Not all evidence points to a finished cycle. Reports published by on-chain analytics firms such as Glassnode show behaviors among long-term holders that look like past up-and-down swings. Demand from late-cycle buyers has softened in ways that mirror prior years, according to that research. It is being argued that halvings remain meaningful interruptions inside a longer trend, not irrelevant events. Macro observers add that broader economic forces—rates, fiat liquidity, and institutional appetite—are increasingly important in the price story.

    "title": "More Eurozone Countries Will Buy Bitcoin, Says Coinbase’s Institutional Chief",
    "body": "An experiment in Prague might end up mattering more for Bitcoin than the usual ETF inflow chart. Speaking on the “Crypto In America” show on 10 December, Coinbase Head of Institutional John D’Agostino highlighted that the Czech National Bank has begun testing Bitcoin in its national treasury and for payments, and argued that this sort of move by a Eurozone central bank is likely to spread. Czech Bitcoin Pilot Could Spread Across Eurozone “The Czech national bank chose very well in their service providers,” he said, adding that the central bank is “putting Bitcoin on their national treasury and they are experimenting with and learning in real time using Bitcoin for payments.” The pilot is small — “a million dollars of Bitcoin” — but for D’Agostino the signal is not in the size, it is in who is doing it and why. He drew a deliberate contrast with earlier sovereign experiments: “No disrespect to El Salvador… this wasn’t a ‘I want to shake up my economy because I’m heading in the wrong direction’… This is, we are a stable Euro zone country… we don’t have to do this.” Related Reading: Standard Chartered Cuts 2026 Bitcoin Price Prediction By 50% Instead, the Czech move followed “all the bells and whistles” of a traditional process: RFPs, vendor selection, formal adoption into policy. That, he suggested, is exactly what makes it dangerous — for the status quo. “That type of thing is contagious and I can see more Euro zone [countries] following suit very very shortly,” he said. The comment did not come in isolation. Throughout the interview, D’Agostino hammered a consistent thesis: institutional adoption has always been less about perfect regulatory clarity and more about liquidity, credible market structure and having the “right” types of participants in the pool. “I’ve always been a bit of a skeptic on the argument that the reason institutions haven’t invested… is regulatory clarity,” he said. Clarity is “top three,” but in his ranking it comes after liquidity and sits alongside alpha potential. If two of the three are present, “people will find a way.” Bitcoin’s spot ETFs, in his view, have already created something the asset previously lacked: a cohort of structurally compelled participants. “The ETFs, in my view, are kind of the surrogate commercial users of Bitcoin,” he argued. They “have to rebalance… it’s codified into their business model,” acting as a stabilizing force similar to industrial users in commodities markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Lacks Fresh Momentum As Realized Cap Growth Still Declining A Eurozone central bank experimenting with Bitcoin on its balance sheet pushes that logic one step further up the food chain. D’Agostino did not spell out a grand theory of “Bitcoin as reserve asset” — he was careful, almost lawyerly, about what he could say — but the implication is not terribly subtle: when a central bank with access to normal EU funding “doesn’t have to do this” and still chooses to, it normalizes Bitcoin inside the most conservative layer of the monetary system. That sits alongside a broader reputational repair job he thinks the industry still has to finish. Crypto, he argued, has had no more structural failures than other markets — he pointed to the London Metal Exchange’s cancellation of billions in nickel trades as an under-discussed parallel to FTX — but “we tend to push the jokers to positions of prominence,” whereas TradFi “does a good job of hiding their jokers.” Between cleaner narratives, ETF-driven “surrogate” demand and now a Eurozone central bank quietly wiring a million dollars into Bitcoin, D’Agostino’s message was that the institutional story is less about a sudden wave and more about erosion. “There’s no wave,” he said earlier in the conversation. “It’s this gradual erosion as opposed to this crashing wave.” If he is right about the Czech experiment being contagious, that erosion may soon be happening from the inside of the Euro system as well, not just from asset managers in New York. At press time, BTC traded at $90,234. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Realized Losses From Entities Surges To 2022 Levels Following Crash Below $90,000",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s price action in the past two weeks has opened a new phase of stress among traders, with on-chain data showing realized losses climbing to heights last observed in 2022. Glassnode’s latest Week-On-Chain report shows Bitcoin is trading above an important cost-basis level but is also visibly straining under intensified loss realization, fading demand and weakening liquidity, which has placed short-term investors in a difficult position. Realized Losses Return To Deep Territory According to Glassnode, realized losses among Bitcoin entities have risen massively, and is now almost at the same magnitudes recorded during the deep retracements of the 2022 bear market. Particularly, the Relative Unrealized Loss (30D-SMA) has climbed to 4.4% after nearly two years below 2%. Related Reading: The Current Bitcoin Price Pump Will End In A Crash – Here’s When To Start Selling The escalation in loss realization reflects how the recent drawdown below $90,000 has forced a large number of market participants to offload coins at prices below their acquisition cost. This, in turn, has disrupted the gradual improvement in profitability seen earlier in the year. Bitcoin’s recent bounce from the November 22 low to above $92,000 hasn’t eased the strain on holders. Glassnode noted that entities are still locking in losses at an increasing pace, with the 30-day average of realized losses now at around $555 million per day. These conditions mean that investors are losing confidence in short-term upside prospects for Bitcoin and choose to reduce exposure, even at unfavorable prices. Therefore, the report noted that resolving it will require a renewed wave of liquidity and demand to rebuild confidence. Glassnode also highlights a sharp rise in profit-taking among long-term holders, whose realized gains have climbed to roughly $1 billion per day and briefly set a new record above $1.3 billion. Even with this elevated level of distribution, Bitcoin is currently positioned just above the True Market Mean, which is a long-standing cost-basis benchmark that serves as a point of structural support. The recent price downturn below $90,000 has pushed this zone close to its limits, but the glimpse of demand reflected around it suggests that price could revisit the 0.75 quantile near $95,000 and possibly approach the short-term holder cost basis as well. Spot ETF, Futures, And Options Markets Indicate Weakness Glassnode’s report points to persistent softness across ETF flows, which have cooled notably after a period of strong inflows earlier in the year. This slowdown represents a reduction in one of the largest and most immediate sources of buy-side liquidity for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Why Is The Bitcoin Price Down Again? Analyst Calls Out Trading Desk For Triggering Crashes Spot market liquidity has also faded, with order books on major exchanges near the lower bound of their 30-day range. This has created an environment where trading activity has weakened through November and into December, and fewer liquidity flows are available to absorb volatility or sustain directional moves. Derivatives positioning reflects similar caution, with funding rates pinned near neutral. Futures open interest has also been subdued and has failed to meaningfully rebuild since the breakdown below $90,000. Across all major venues, the tone is the same: liquidity is lighter, sentiment is softening, and participants are leaning defensive rather than pursuing short-term rallies. The attention is now on how Bitcoin will respond in the aftermath of the Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",
