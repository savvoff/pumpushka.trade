    "title": "Analyst Says the Worst Is Over For Dogecoin, Predicts Rally To $0.8",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Charting Guy has predicted that the worst may be over for Dogecoin, with a potential rally to $0.8 on the cards. This comes as meme coins like DOGE dominate the crypto market at the start of this new year. Dogecoin Eyes Rally To $0.8 As The Worst May Be Over In an X post, Charting Guy shared a chart showing that Dogecoin could rally to as high as $0.8, marking a new all-time high for the foremost meme coin. Based on this, he remarked that the worst may be over if the meme coin was following a chart pattern he had mapped out earlier. The analyst had earlier raised the possibility of DOGE entering a long-term consolidation, similar to XRP, and then breaking out, with a rally to as high as $1. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On The Brink Of A 9,000% Rally To $10? What Historical Performance Shows Charting Guy’s accompanying chart showed that Dogecoin could trade sideways until mid-2028 and then break out to this $0.8 target, with the possibility of even reaching the psychological $1 level. With the worst being over, the drop to $0.11 last month could mark the bottom for the meme coin, especially seeing as it has regained its bull market structure. Dogecoin has begun the year with a rally of almost of 30% as meme coins lead the current crypto market rally. Thanks to this, DOGE is the top gainer among the top 10 cryptos by market cap. The rally has also reignited institutional interest in the meme coin, with the DOGE ETFs recording significant inflows. SoSoValue data show that these funds recorded net inflows of $2.30 million on December 2 and $1.60 million yesterday, marking the first time they have seen consecutive inflows since December 3, 2025. How Things Could Play Out For DOGE In The Short Term In another X post, Charting Guy shared a chart highlighting his lower-timeframe speculation for Dogecoin. The chart showed that DOGE could sustain this rally and reach $0.2 at the start of February. Once that happens, the meme coin could experience a sharp pullback, dropping to as low as $0.12 in March, which could mark the bottom. Dogecoin will then see another impulsive move to the upside, breaking above $0.2 this time around and potentially reaching $0.22. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Rally To All-Time Highs If It Breaks This Resistance Level Crypto analyst Javon Marks provided a more bullish outlook for Dogecoin, stating that the next seemingly modest targets are $0.6533 and $1.25111. However, he added that altcoin seasons have shown that DOGE can have upside potential beyond the imagination of many people, and his accompanying chart indicated that a rally to $11 was possible. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.15, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Peakpx, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Wins As Trump Pumps GDP, Suppresses Oil: Arthur Hayes",
    "body": "Arthur Hayes argues that the US move to seize control of Venezuelan oil is less about geopolitics than electoral math and that the resulting policy mix of hotter nominal growth and capped energy costs is structurally bullish for Bitcoin and high-beta crypto. In a Jan. 6 essay titled “Suavemente,” the BitMEX co-founder frames the current moment through a deliberately simple lens: US politicians optimize for re-election, and the median voter optimizes for perceived economic wellbeing. “The question is, does the American colonization of Venezuela make Bitcoin/crypto number go up or down?” Hayes writes. Hayes’ core claim is that US political control is decided at the margins, and those margins respond overwhelmingly to the economy and inflation, particularly “food and energy” inflation. “Above all else… the only issue that the median voter cares about is the economy,” he writes. “It is easy to pump the economy, and by that, I mean nominal GDP. That is just a question of how much credit Trump can create.” Related Reading: Venezuela, Geopolitical Risk, And Bitcoin: What On-Chain Data Really Shows But Hayes insists the same playbook can backfire if inflation follows, especially at the pump. “The key metric for Americans is the price of gasoline,” he writes, arguing that limited public transportation makes gas prices a daily referendum on economic management. In that framework, Venezuela’s value is straightforward: suppress oil, suppress gasoline, and keep the “run the economy hot” promise intact without triggering voter backlash. He highlights what he calls a “10% rule”: “when the national average price of gasoline rises 10% or more in the three months preceding an election versus the average price in January of the same calendar year, control of one or more branches of government switches teams.” That dynamic, in his telling, creates two regimes that matter for markets: nominal GDP/credit up with oil up, or nominal GDP/credit up with oil flat-to-down. Why Bitcoin “Wins” If Oil Stays Contained Hayes’ bullish conclusion rests on the idea that oil prices constrain the durability of money printing, not the mechanics of Bitcoin itself. “Because of the energy used running computers engaged in proof of work mining, Bitcoin is the purest monetary abstraction there is,” he writes. “Therefore, the price of energy is irrelevant to the price of Bitcoin as all miners will face a parallel shift up or down in the price at the same time. The price of oil only matters regarding its ability to force politicians to stop printing money.” Related Reading: John Bollinger: Bitcoin BB Squeeze Breakout Targets $107,000 In his setup, the stress signals are macro-market ones: the 10-year Treasury yield and the MOVE Index, a measure of bond-market volatility. He argues that when oil rises far enough to push yields “close to 5%,” volatility spikes, leverage unwinds, and policymakers are pressured into a pivot. Hayes points to a prior episode as a template for reflexivity: “If you remember, Trump threatened tariffs so high… markets tanked, and the MOVE Index spiked to an intraday high of 172. The next day after the spike, Trump… ‘paused’ the tariffs, and markets bottomed then recovered violently.” Absent that stress, Hayes’ base case is aggressive credit expansion with oil “subsided if not outright fall,” which he ties directly to Bitcoin upside. He cites his “USD Liquidity Conditions Index” as evidence that Bitcoin’s trend tracks dollar liquidity, concluding: “As the amount of dollars expands, the price of Bitcoin and certain cryptos will sky rocket.” The essay also reads like a positioning memo. Hayes says his fund, Maelstrom, entered 2026 with “almost maximum risk,” low dollar-stable exposure, and an intention to rotate: “To obtain outperformance versus BTC and ETH, I will sell BTC to fund privacy positions and sell ETH to fund DeFi.” He names Zcash (ZEC) as the “privacy beta,” saying the fund is “already long a fuck ton of that” from 3Q25. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $93,841. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Pundit Warns XRP Investors To Stop Calling For $10,000, Shares ‘Realistic’ Price Targets",
    "body": "A prominent crypto commentator known as Mason Versluis has issued a notable warning for XRP investors, pointing out that parts of the discussion around XRP to lofty price targets as high as $10,000 have drifted far away from reality and risk misleading investors. Pundit Pushes Back Against $10,000 XRP Predictions Bullish price predictions around XRP have been arriving at an unusually fast pace in recent months, especially as spot exchange-traded funds and institutional participation are now a major part of investor conversations. Related Reading: The Great XRP Exodus: Here’s How Much Is Left On Crypto Exchanges Social media platforms are now filled with increasingly high targets, ranging from triple-digit valuations to extreme calls for four-figure and even five-figure prices at $10,000. Just a few years ago, you would not have believed such XRP price predictions would be as rampant as this. In a recent video clip circulating across the crypto community, Mason Versluis delivered an unusually blunt assessment of the $10,000 predictions for the altcoin. He dismissed the figure outright, noting that such price targets should not even be part of current conversations. According to Versluis, anyone aggressively promoting those numbers is doing investors a disservice and misleading them. His argument is based on the fact that XRP has yet to demonstrate the ability to break above far lower price levels, making five-digit projections detached from present conditions. A closer look at XRP’s circulating supply explains why the $10,000 prediction raises doubts. XRP currently has a circulating supply of about 66 billion tokens with a market cap of $141.9 billion. Therefore, calculations based on the current circulating supply would imply a market cap of roughly $660 trillion if the altcoin reaches $10,000, which is far greater than the current top 100 assets by market cap combined. To put this in context, gold currently has a market cap of about $31 trillion. The most realistic way that the token might reach $10,000 is for the circulating supply to decrease significantly. Bullish Bias Exists, But Built Around Progression According to Versias, XRP reaching $10,000 is not outright impossible. However, the world has only seen roughly 2% of the changes that would be required for XRP to approach a $10,000 valuation. Related Reading: Here’s How Much The XRP Price Will Be If It Overtakes Ethereum In Market Cap XRP has not even reached $10, let alone maintained it. In order for any outstanding price levels to become a reality, XRP would first need to break above double digits $10, and hold above. From here, discussions about $50, $100, or higher only become meaningful after XRP proves strength at each preceding level. Despite the criticism, Versluis made it clear that his outlook on XRP is not bearish. He acknowledged that his stance has grown increasingly optimistic due to developments such as ETF momentum, DeFi activity, and institutional engagement surrounding XRP and the XRP ledger, continuing to improve.

    "body": "Dogecoin (DOGE) has extended its rally into early 2026, showing signs of sustained momentum as the memecoin space experiences renewed interest. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Shiba Inu Price Jumped Over 13% After a nearly 30% rise over four days, DOGE is consolidating above key technical levels, supported by rising trading volumes, derivatives data, and the growing popularity of leveraged Dogecoin ETFs. DOGE's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Technical Momentum Supports Dogecoin Consolidation Dogecoin’s recent surge began after establishing a base around $0.132, breaking through resistance zones at $0.145 and $0.150. The rally peaked near $0.154 before entering a consolidation phase, a typical pattern in trending markets that suggests a healthy price structure rather than a sharp reversal. Currently trading near $0.151, DOGE remains above short-term moving averages, with immediate support levels at $0.150 and $0.145. Technical indicators, like the RSI, are above 50, signaling ongoing bullish momentum. However, some oscillators near overbought territory suggest that minor pullbacks could occur. On the upside, breaking through the $0.154 to $0.155 resistance range could pave the way for targets between $0.162 and $0.166, with potential extensions toward $0.175 and $0.180. Conversely, a drop below $0.142 may open the door to lower support levels near $0.135. DOGE ETF Activity and Whale Accumulation Fuel Rally The derivatives market reflects growing confidence in DOGE. Open interest in Dogecoin futures recently peaked at 13.47 billion contracts before a slight controlled decline, indicating leveraged positions are being managed cautiously rather than rapidly unwound. Adding to the momentum, a 2x leveraged Dogecoin ETF has become one of the top-performing ETFs in the first quarter of 2026, highlighting renewed institutional and retail interest. These ETFs amplify buying pressure by requiring fund managers to adjust their holdings to maintain leverage, effectively creating a feedback loop that can boost DOGE’s price during upswings. Large holders, or whales, have been active, purchasing hundreds of millions of DOGE tokens within a short span. This accumulation suggests confidence in further upside and can create a supply squeeze that reinforces price gains. Memecoin Revival Reflects Broader Market Trends Dogecoin’s rally is part of a larger revival in the memecoin sector. The overall market capitalization of memecoins has increased by more than 30% recently, reaching nearly $48 billion after months of underperformance. Historically, periods of low memecoin dominance often precede significant rallies, and DOGE, as the original and most liquid memecoin, frequently leads these cycles. Related Reading: John Bollinger: Bitcoin BB Squeeze Breakout Targets $107,000 The broader crypto market’s relative stability, particularly in Bitcoin and Ethereum, supports speculative flows into high-beta assets like DOGE. Additionally, social media engagement and mentions from influential figures can provide further catalysts, although these factors remain unpredictable.

    "title": "Japan’s XRP Integration Signals A Shift In Global Capital Flows",
    "body": "Japan’s integration of XRP into regulated capital flow infrastructure marks a decisive shift in how digital assets are being positioned within modern finance. The move suggests that XRP is transitioning from a cross-border payments tool into a component of regulated capital flow infrastructure. It also reframes XRP as a settlement layer increasingly aligned with institutional standards, compliance frameworks, and real-world financial throughput. Why This Integration Marks A Structural Inflection Point For XRP The Japanese are embedding XRP and crypto into core capital flows. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull revealed that when the Japanese finance minister openly supports crypto integration within stock exchanges, it’s not just policy. Rather, it is a regulatory green light for integration into core capital markets. Related Reading: XRP Advances As A Recognized Digital Asset In Regulated Markets — Here’s How Furthermore, this move will open the door to a $7 trillion value in equity rails and provide the altcoin a direct path to be regulated into Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs), broker access, and structured products. With SBI corridors and RLUSD already live, this has become a demand engine, not a theory. XRP has been integrated into Japan’s financial system for years, backed by real-world infrastructure and regulated clarity. The alignment between rails and regulation is rare, but now the capital can meet the infrastructure. According to an analyst known as UnknowDLT, not enough has been said about GTreasury. Currently, Ripple is partnering with JPMorgan. This partnership is an infrastructure-level connection that has placed Ripple technology to directly access the corporate payment rails used by JPMorgan and other large banks. By integrating Ripple’s stack at this layer, it will allow XRP to be used as a settlement asset or a backend liquidity layer, without the end user explicitly using the altcoin. When inserted behind the scenes, the altcoin can reduce prefunding, optimize liquidity, and act as a neutral bridge asset between currencies and systems. How Demand Steps In At Key Structural Level For XRP Crypto trader known as ZiP on X has highlighted that the support zone at the end of November has now been clearly defended, and the market responded with two strong bullish candles on the weekly chart. This is the first clear sign that demand has stepped in exactly where it should be on the higher timeframe. Related Reading: Analyst Updates XRP Price Prediction: Why $16 Is Still On The Table Currently, the XRP price is approaching a key decision area around $2.30, a zone that stands out as the area where supply may become active and attempt to show or stop the move higher. The reaction from this zone will show the market’s next move. However, if demand manages to break through the $2.30 level and hold the price above it on a weekly closing basis, it would signal acceptance, as the next significant resistance sits around $3.20.

    "body": "XRP surged 12% to reach $2.42 on January 6, marking its highest price since mid-November 2025, before hovering around the current $2.35 mark. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Shiba Inu Price Jumped Over 13% The jump coincided with a strong influx of capital into XRP-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs), technical breakout patterns, and a sharp reduction in short positions. These aspects combined to drive one of the most notable rallies in the crypto market’s early 2026 recovery phase. XRP's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview XRP ETF Inflows and Institutional Interest Fuel Gains Spot XRP ETFs recorded $48 million in net inflows on January 5 and 6, marking the largest daily inflows since their launch in November 2024. Over the past eight weeks, these ETFs have experienced a consistent inflow of approximately $1.23 billion, reflecting a growing institutional appetite for XRP exposure. The increased buying pressure from these funds is helping absorb selling pressure and reduce the available supply on exchanges. Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer at Kronos Research, noted that ETF inflows combined with XRP breaking key resistance levels on strong volume have heightened traders’ risk appetite. This institutional interest is supported by regulatory clarity following 2025’s Ripple’s settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which removed a major obstacle to adoption. Technical Breakout and Short Squeeze Accelerate Price Movement Technical analysts point to a breakout from a falling wedge pattern, with XRP maintaining levels above its 50-day moving average, a positive indicator for momentum traders. During the price surge, over $250 million in short positions were liquidated within a single hour, adding fuel to the rally by forcing short sellers to cover their bets. Renowned trader John Bollinger, inventor of the Bollinger Bands, commented that XRP is following a similar bullish pattern to Bitcoin and Ethereum but with slightly weaker momentum. Nonetheless, he suggested that XRP’s price could track Bitcoin’s upward trend, with analysts projecting a potential target near $3.50 if current support levels hold. Broader Market Context and Future Outlook XRP’s rally comes amid a broader crypto market recovery, with Bitcoin and Ethereum rising 7.4% and 9.3% respectively over the past week. On-chain data indicate a decline in XRP balances on centralized exchanges, suggesting reduced selling pressure. Institutional backing continues to grow, with PwC recently endorsing Ripple as a core player in blockchain-based financial services. Major banks such as Standard Chartered have projected XRP prices as high as $8 by the end of 2026, based on Ripple’s increasing integration in cross-border payments and settlement solutions. Related Reading: John Bollinger: Bitcoin BB Squeeze Breakout Targets $107,000 As market sentiment improves and regulatory uncertainties ease, XRP appears positioned to benefit from both technical momentum and growing institutional demand. Traders will be watching closely to see if XRP can sustain gains above key resistance zones around $2.30 and potentially push toward higher price targets.

    "body": "XRP has shown a notable uptick in price action in the past 48 hours as XRP’s price pushed higher from below $2 at the beginning of the year, but it now finds itself trading near the $2.40 region. Interestingly, this recent push is more than just a bounce, especially as a longer-term chart structure shows comparisons with XRP’s behavior ahead of its 2017 breakout. How The 2017 Structure Unfolded Before The Surge Technical analysis of XRP’s current price action on the weekly candlestick timeframe chart shows that the cryptocurrency is currently tracing out a similar price action to what it went through back in 2017 on the 3-day chart. In that earlier period, price action unfolded through a well-defined five-wave sequence, characterized by alternating phases of decline and recovery. Waves one, three, and five each pushed the price lower with corrective pressure, while waves two and four produced temporary rebounds that relieved selling pressure but failed to establish a lasting trend reversal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Parabola: What’s Different Between The Last Bull Cycle And This One? The final stage of that sequence was particularly important. During the fifth wave, XRP’s decline slowed and compressed into a falling wedge formation. XRP’s price slipped below the $0.005 level and eventually stabilized around $0.00485, where downside follow-through became increasingly limited. From here, the downside pressure gradually weakened, volatility contracted, and selling momentum faded. When XRP finally broke out of that compression, it quickly reclaimed the $0.008 zone and broke through $0.02, resulting in the start of a rally that ultimately delivered gains well in excess of 1,000%. XRP Price Chart. Source: @Steph_iscrypto According to Steph’s analysis, XRP’s recent price action is following a remarkably similar rhythm. After topping out around $3.40 in mid-2025, the cryptocurrency entered a corrective phase that pushed the price steadily lower to create a falling wedge structure. That decline found support at $1.74, where selling pressure slowed and price action stopped making aggressive new lows. Now, it seems XRP is breaking out of the falling wedge and back to solidifying its price action above $2. XRP Price Action In Focus Now that XRP is back to trading above $2 and above the falling wedge, the next course of action is to look at how the price behaves from here. Of course, the most bullish course of action is for XRP to repeat a 1,000% rally, which would place it at a price target around $22. Related Reading: Popular Crypto Founder Dumps Millions In Ethereum, Here’s What He’s Buying In terms of how this plays out, there are resistance levels to watch out for. The $2.30 area is an early test, followed by $2.50 and $2.80, which are prior consolidation levels where XRP slowed down during its push to all-time highs in 2025. After that, the $3.10 price level and the previous 2018 high at $3.40 are the major resistances that would need to be reclaimed. On the downside, sustained weakness below $1.90, and especially a move back toward $1.74, would challenge the idea that the corrective phase has fully played out.

    "title": "XRP Breaks Structure With Power — Now The Real Test Begins At $2.41",
    "body": "XRP has surged past recent resistance with impressive momentum, signaling strength in the current rally. However, the real challenge now lies at the $2.41 cost-basis zone, a key area where a significant amount of XRP was previously accumulated. How price reacts here will likely dictate whether bulls can maintain control and push toward higher targets, or if selling pressure creates a temporary pause or pullback. XRP Approaches A Critical Cost-Basis Resistance At $2.41 According to a recent update from Steph Is Crypto, XRP is now at a pivotal crossroads, with price action increasingly centered around the $2.41 level. This zone stands out as a major cost-basis wall where several technical and on-chain signals align, making it a decisive area in determining whether the current rally can extend or begin to stall. Related Reading: XRP Enters A Make-or-Break Zone As This Long-Term Support Cracks The cost-basis distribution heatmap highlights the $2.41 region as a dense supply cluster. Cost basis represents the price levels at which tokens were previously acquired. When the price returns to these areas, they often attract heightened trading activity. On-chain data shows that between $2.39 and $2.41, roughly 1.56 billion XRP were accumulated. Many holders who bought in this range may look to exit positions to break even as the price revisits the zone, introducing selling pressure and reinforcing the area as resistance. This dynamic is also reflected in the XRP price chart, which shows repeated hesitation and multiple rejections around the same level. The alignment between on-chain supply data and technical price action suggests that $2.41 is an important level that XRP must overcome decisively to unlock the next leg higher. Wave 3 Breaks Out Above The 2.618 Extension With Strong Momentum Tara revealed that XRP’s Wave 3 has delivered a powerful breakout, pushing beyond the 2.618 Fibonacci extension and clearing the macro resistance at $2.30. This move was accompanied by a strong RSI reading, signaling strength behind the advance. Related Reading: XRP Price May Be Bearish Below $2, But On-Chain Data Tells A Different Story With Wave 3 extending higher, Tara identified $2.49 as the next key upside target, which aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci extension of the fifth wave. Despite the strength of the move, Tara advised preparing for a short-term pullback. A brief retracement could allow the RSI to cool off, creating healthier conditions for the next leg higher and potentially setting up a clearer divergence on a renewed push. As long as XRP remains above the macro 0.236 Fibonacci level, the broader bullish structure stays intact. Tara is closely monitoring lower-timeframe support zones, marked in green, while continuing to track the move as a developing Wave 1/3 impulse.

    "title": "XRP Shows “Coiled Spring” Setup As Network Liquidity Hits Record Levels",
    "body": "XRP has regained momentum after reclaiming the $2.20 level and extending its move toward the $2.41 mark, marking one of its strongest advances in recent months. The recovery comes after a prolonged period of selling pressure and uncertainty, and it has reignited bullish expectations among a segment of investors who now believe XRP could challenge or even surpass its all-time high later this year. While skepticism remains across the broader market, price action suggests that XRP is no longer purely defensive. Related Reading: Venezuela, Geopolitical Risk, And Bitcoin: What On-Chain Data Really Shows According to a recent CryptoQuant report, early January brought visible improvement across the crypto sector, with Bitcoin pushing toward $93,000 and XRP moving decisively above $2.30. That synchronized strength helped shift sentiment, as XRP broke out of its prior consolidation range and began showing signs of renewed trend formation. Significantly, the move has not been driven by price alone. On-chain data points to a deeper structural change within the XRP ecosystem. Activity on the XRP Ledger has accelerated sharply, with network growth reaching levels not seen during the previous consolidation phase. This expansion suggests that rising prices are being supported by genuine usage and participation rather than short-term speculation. XRPL Liquidity Surge Signals Structural Shift Behind Breakout The CryptoQuant report indicates a decisive change in XRP’s market structure, driven not only by price appreciation but also by deep shifts in liquidity and participation. One of the most striking developments is the explosion in liquidity on the XRPL decentralized exchange, which has climbed to roughly $173 billion. Rather than thinning out during periods of weakness, liquidity has expanded sharply, suggesting that large players are actively positioning rather than exiting. This behavior is typically associated with preparation for heightened volatility or a more durable trend change. The timing of this expansion is also important. Since mid-December, liquidity spikes have become both more frequent and larger in size, a pattern that aligns with the entry of more sophisticated market makers. This effectively transforms the trading environment, making it easier for whales and institutional participants to deploy size without causing disruptive price swings. In practical terms, XRP is becoming a more efficient market for large-scale capital. Crucially, this liquidity is not idle. Transaction activity on the XRPL DEX has surged, indicating that deeper order books are supporting real usage rather than passive positioning. At the same time, market behavior has shifted toward buyer dominance. Aggressive buying has taken control, while bearish pressure has faded, allowing the price to break out of its prior compression. Forced short covering further reinforced that move and helped propel XRP through key resistance near $2.30. Together, these dynamics suggest that structural improvements, not just speculative momentum, underpin XRP’s recent strength.

XRP Faces Heavy Overhead Resistance XRP’s daily chart shows a notable shift in short-term momentum after a prolonged period of downside pressure. Price has surged from the December lows near the $1.85–$1.90 zone and is now trading around $2.35, marking a sharp recovery that has caught sellers off guard. Following months of lower highs and lower lows, analysts view this rebound as an early trend reversal attempt instead of a confirmed bullish continuation The breakout above the short-term moving average (blue line) is a constructive development. This level had previously acted as dynamic resistance throughout November and December, consistently rejecting upside attempts. Reclaiming it signals improving momentum and a potential shift in market structure. However, XRP is now approaching a dense resistance cluster between $2.45 and $2.65, where both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages converge. Historically, this zone has attracted strong selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Shows Aggressive Sellers In Control As BTC Consolidates Below $90K While the recent rally shows increased participation compared to late December, it remains well below the levels seen during prior impulsive advances. This suggests that although buyers are regaining control, conviction is still developing. A period of consolidation above $2.20 would help solidify this move. If XRP can hold above the $2.30–$2.35 area, the probability of a broader recovery toward $2.70 increases. Failure to do so would likely result in a pullback, keeping XRP range-bound and vulnerable to renewed selling pressure. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Accumulation: Data Shows Institutions Are Net Buyers Again",
    "body": "After a phase of net Bitcoin selling, on-chain data suggests institutional entities have started accumulating the cryptocurrency once more. Bitcoin Rose Over 41% The Last Time Institutions Turned Into Net Buyers As pointed out by Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards in an X post, institutions have once again turned into net buyers of Bitcoin. Below is the chart shared by Edwards that shows the trend in institutional behavior over the last few years. From the graph, it’s visible that institutional investors switched their behavior to selling back in October as Bitcoin observed a bearish shift following its price top above $126,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Capitulation Ends: Hash Ribbons Flash Buy Signal The distribution calmed down as the cryptocurrency stabilized into a phase of consolidation in December, with a turn to positive levels starting to appear. The metric has now grown further in the new year, a potential sign that institutional behavior may really be changing to one of net accumulation. In the chart, the analyst has highlighted the price moves that followed shifts to net buying from these humongous traders in the past. It would appear that, on average, Bitcoin rose 109% after this signal appeared. Though the individual outcomes have seen high variance, ranging from a rally of 390% after the 2020 signal to a drop of 13% in 2024. The last time that the signal appeared was in the first half of 2025 and what followed was a price surge of 41%. It now remains to be seen how the cryptocurrency’s price will be affected this time around. A notable pillar of institutional buying in the sector today is represented by the treasury companies. Like the wider institutional behavior, these entities were also net sellers of Bitcoin late last year, as Edwards has highlighted in another X post. The above chart shows the trend in the 30-day rate of change in the Buy-Sell Ratio associated with BTC treasuries, a metric that compares their cumulative USD buying against selling. It would appear that the indicator has just flipped positive in 2026. “Bitcoin treasury companies just flipped to net buying again,” noted the analyst.

    "body": "Ethereum price started a steady upward move above $3,200. ETH is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above $3,300. Ethereum started a fresh increase above $3,150 and $3,200. The price is trading above $3,220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,200 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it clears the $3,265 zone. Ethereum Price Holds Gains Ethereum price started a fresh increase after it settled above the $3,120 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price gained pace for a move above the $3,200 and $3,220 resistance levels. The bulls even pumped the price toward $3,300. A high was formed at $3,299, and the price is now consolidating gains. It declined a few points to test the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $3,181 swing low to the $3,299 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,200 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If the bulls are able to protect more losses below $3,200, the price could attempt another increase. Immediate resistance is seen near the $3,265 level. The first key resistance is near the $3,280 level. The next major resistance is near the $3,300 level. A clear move above the $3,300 resistance might send the price toward the $3,350 resistance. An upside break above the $3,350 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,450 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,265 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,220 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $3,181 swing low to the $3,299 high. The first major support sits near the $3,200 zone and the trend line. A clear move below the $3,200 support might push the price toward the $3,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 region. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.

    "title": "Ether Staking Heats Up As Entry Queue Hits 1.3 Million ETH",
    "body": "According to Beaconcha.in data and market reports, the Ethereum validator exit queue has shrunk to just 32 ETH, with a wait time of about one minute. That is a steep drop from its mid-September peak of 2.67 million ETH — a fall of almost a hundred percent. Markets often react when locked assets are freed up for sale. Right now, that specific source of immediate selling seems to have faded. Related Reading: Crypto Users Lose Far Less To Phishing As Losses Drop 83% – Details Validator Exit Queue Near Empty The exit mechanism limits how fast validators can stop validating and pull out their full stake. With the queue near zero, there is no backlog waiting to cash out. That reduces one form of nervous selling. Validators still earn rewards while queued and can face penalties if they act badly, but the bottleneck that once forced slow exits is gone. Reports show the withdrawal process for partial payouts remains separate, and those smaller payouts continue without affecting the full-exit flow. Entry Queue Hits Fresh Highs Based on reports, the entry queue has climbed to about 1.3 million ETH, its largest level since mid-November. Large operators are sending chunks of ETH into staking. BitMine began staking on Dec. 26 and added 82,560 ETH to the queue on Jan. 3. The firm now lists 659,219 ETH staked, worth roughly $2.1 billion at current prices. BitMine’s wider holdings stand at just over 4.1 million ETH, representing about 3.4% of the total supply and valued near $13 billion. Those moves add real, measurable demand for staked Ether and help explain why fewer validators appear eager to leave. Exchange Balances And Liquidity Exchange reserves for ETH sit at multi-year lows. That matters because when fewer coins are parked on trading platforms, automatic or panic selling becomes harder to pull off. Traders and analysts point to this as a reason selling pressure is easing. Some industry figures have been quoted saying the exit queue is “basically empty,” and that selling pressure is drying up as staking outpaces withdrawals. Still, the market can move by other means — derivatives, lending desks, and off-exchange trades can shift exposure without touching the staking queues.

    "body": "Solana started a fresh increase above the $135 zone. SOL price is now consolidating above $135 and might aim for more gains above the $140 zone. SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $135 and $138 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $135 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a contracting triangle forming with support at $138 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could extend gains if it clears the $140 resistance zone. Solana Price Eyes Another Increase Solana price started a decent increase after it settled above the $130 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL climbed above the $135 level to enter a short-term positive zone. The price even smashed the $140 resistance. The bulls were able to push the price above $142. Recently, there were a couple of swing moves and the price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent upward move from the $136 swing low to the $141 high. Solana is now trading above $138 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a contracting triangle forming with support at $138 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near $140. The next major resistance is near the $142 level. The main resistance could be $145. A successful close above the $145 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $150. Any more gains might send the price toward the $155 level. Downside Break In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $142 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $138 zone, the trend line, and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent upward move from the $136 swing low to the $141 high. The first major support is near the $136 level. A break below the $136 level might send the price toward the $130 support zone. If there is a close below the $130 support, the price could decline toward the $120 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $138 and $136. Major Resistance Levels – $140 and $142.",

    "body": "Solana (SOL), one of the foremost blockchains in the cryptocurrency sector, recently released its annual review for 2025, showcasing major growth across several key metrics, including daily active wallets and decentralized exchange (DEX) volume. Seven Solana Apps Break $100 Million Revenue Barrier According to the report issued on social media platform X (previously Twitter) applications built on Solana generated $2.39 billion in revenue, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 46% and marking a new all-time high (ATH). Seven standout applications in particular, including Pumpfun, each surpassed the $100 million revenue threshold in 2025. Additionally, the variety of smaller applications—those earning under $100 million—collectively produced over $500 million in revenue.

Furthermore, the network averaged 1,054 non-vote transactions per second (TPS) while unique active wallets averaged 3.2 million daily, marking a 50% increase year-on-year. In terms of wallet growth, Solana saw 725 million new wallets. Bitcoin Trading Volume Skyrockets To $33 Billion In terms of asset management, Solana’s stablecoin supply ended the year at $14.8 billion, more than doubling year-on-year. The blockchain facilitated a colossal $11.7 trillion in stablecoin transfers, marking a sevenfold increase over two years. Notably, equities made their debut on Solana in 2025, achieving a supply of $1 billion and trading volume of $651 million. Bitcoin trading volume grew fivefold compared to the previous year, reaching $33 billion and solidifying a new ATH. The total Bitcoin supply also doubled to $770 million. Staked SOL also saw an increase, with 421 million tokens staked, representing an 8% growth and another ATH. Additionally, the introduction of Solana ETFs attracted net inflows of $1.02 billion. SOL-Stablecoin Volume Soars To $782 Billion In the realm of decentralized exchanges, the total DEX volume reached $1.5 trillion, reflecting a 57% year-over-year growth and another all-time high for the network’s annual review. The trading volume for SOL-stablecoins set a record at $782 billion, more than doubling year-over-year. Twelve DEX platforms managed to process over $10 billion in volume, with Raydium leading the way at $347 billion. Furthermore, the artificial intelligence (AI) agent volume reached a new all-time high of $31 billion, along with tokenized asset volume rising to $598 million and project token volume increasing to $86 billion.

Trading platforms contributed significantly to Solana’s ecosystem, earning $940 million, a 44% increase compared to the prior year.

    "title": "Ethereum Staking Queue Grows: What Does This Mean For ETH Prices Moving Forward?",
    "body": "As Ethereum (ETH) recently reclaimed key levels above $3,200, the dynamics within its staking system have shifted significantly. For the first time in nearly six months, the entry queue for staking Ethereum now exceeds the exit queue, a development viewed by many as a bullish indicator for ETH prices. Currently, a substantial 1.32 million ETH is waiting to be staked, with an average wait time of 23 days, while only about 3,000 ETH are queued for withdrawal, which takes merely an hour, indicating a net increase in locked ETH rather than unlocked coins. Bullish Signals For Ethereum Analysts at Bull Theory suggest that historically, significant spikes in entry queues occur when investor confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential rises. In contrast, increases in exit queues are often associated with market fear or forced sell-offs. Presently, the landscape shows rising entry demand, decreasing exit pressure, and an overall increase in net lock-up, a combination that has frequently been observed before stronger bullish cycles for ETH. Related Reading: XRP Surges Towards $2.20: Leading Monday Gains And Driving Crypto ETF Inflows Compounding this positive sentiment is the current high level of network activity. Daily transactions on the Ethereum network are trending upwards, indicating that market participants are actively engaging with the platform rather than leaving it. Enhanced network usage leads to increased ETH burning, contributing to a supply crunch that further supports the asset’s value. According to the analysts, institutional investment is one of the notable drivers behind the current surge in staking. In just the past two weeks, BitMine – the public company with the largest Ethereum holdings – has staked around $2.58 billion worth of ETH, signaling a long-term commitment to the asset and suggesting growing institutional interest in the digital asset. Key Factors Suggest A Significant Upswing Ahead This development comes ahead of potential catalysts that could further boost staking demand. While the BlackRock Ethereum staking ETF is still awaiting approval, its eventual green light could grant access to a broader pool of traditional capital, thereby enhancing the overall staking demand for ETH. Additionally, ETH has successfully broken out of a three-month downward trend. If it can reclaim levels between $3,500 and $3,600, the analysts predict that a substantial rally could follow. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches $93,000 Amid Renewed Optimism: What To Keep An Eye On This Week As of now, ETH has recovered by 11% in the past two weeks according to CoinGecko data, positioning the token just below these key levels at $3,270. This performance has even surpassed that of Bitcoin (BTC), which has recorded gains of just 6% in the same time frame. Taking into account additional factors such as the anticipated approval of the BlackRock ETF and the potential for regulatory clarity through the passing of the Market Structure Bill, also known as the Clarity Act, Ethereum appears to be in a strong position to experience a significant rally in 2026.

    "title": "XRP Rally Reopens The $8–$12 Zone Debate, Says Will Taylor",
    "body": "XRP has jumped roughly 25% off its recent lows (at one point), and Cryptoinsightuk co-founder Will Taylor says the move has reopened the debate over whether XRP is starting a larger impulse that could ultimately point toward the $8–$12 zone or whether it’s a short-term squeeze that needs to cool first. Taylor said he’s “up in the air” on the immediate next step, even as he remains long. His hesitation is rooted in a simple conflict: the lower timeframes look stretched, but XRP has a track record of accelerating after momentum spikes rather than immediately mean-reverting. What The XRP Charts Tell Us On the hourly, Taylor noted XRP’s RSI has repeatedly hit overbought territory and “we’ve crossed bearish on the hour,” a short-term warning that often precedes pullbacks or sideways digestion. On the four-hour, he described RSI as “about as high as I’ve pretty much ever seen it,” and tried to contextualize what happened the last few times XRP got similarly overheated. In one prior episode, he said XRP pulled back briefly, then continued higher by “a further like 36%.” In another, he described a rally sequence where price consolidated and then ran again, adding “another 129%” into the next leg. Related Reading: Same XRP Setup That Led To Over 1,000% Increase In 2017 Is Playing Out Again That’s the core of his dilemma: overbought conditions can be a sell signal in many markets, but Taylor argues XRP’s strongest phases often begin with RSI entering overbought, not ending there. “When XRP’s daily RSI gets overbought, XRP rips in price a lot of the time,” he said, pushing back on the reflex to fade strength. On the daily chart, he highlighted what he sees as a constructive technical shift. XRP has closed above a short-term range that previously capped price for multiple days, and printed its “highest daily close in XRP since the 13th of November.” Taylor emphasized how quickly XRP cleared that ceiling this time: after multiple failed attempts in the prior weeks, “we break straight through.” XRP Price Targets From there, Taylor laid out the upside logic using historical RSI analogs. He said three previous daily overbought signals during the current cycle coincided with major extensions, citing moves of roughly 414% in one instance and 36% and 49% in others. He framed this as pattern recognition rather than prediction: “this is complete fact,” he said, referring to the historical relationship between daily RSI overbought and subsequent upside but he still translated those rough percentages into possible zones. A smaller continuation on the order of ~39% would, in his words, take XRP to around $3.13. A larger extension could revisit all-time highs near $3.66. The most aggressive interpretation, aligned with his broader wave thesis, would move XRP “up towards our goals of like $8 to $12 for this wave.” Related Reading: Only 1 Week Left As XRP RSI Breakout Sets Up $10 Path, Analyst Predicts Structurally, Taylor said the market is at a point where multiple Elliott Wave counts can be argued. He sketched competing interpretations: XRP may be working through an ABC-type move off the lows, may be approaching a fifth wave higher, or could still be in an extended third wave within a larger five-wave advance. “My honest answer is right now I don’t know,” he said. Even without committing to a wave count, Taylor said the “impulsive” character of the rally stands out. He pointed to “the length of these candles supported by volume” across exchanges, arguing the move looks different from earlier, more corrective price action. For him, the practical test is near-term continuation: he wants to see “some more really aggressive candles” over the next day or two to support the idea that XRP is leading a broader leg rather than squeezing and stalling. Liquidity is the other piece he’s watching. Taylor said XRP has “on the hourly taken most of our upside liquidity,” while flagging downside liquidity zones around $1.70 down to $1.66. He said in established trends he would “expect a continuation to the upside,” but those downside pools, combined with stretched RSI and nearby resistance on XRP’s relative pairs, keep him from treating the current level as a clean new entry. Taylor said these mixed signals are why he has considered reducing leverage on his XRP long, noting he is “90% spot.” His bottom line was simple: XRP has delivered “a fantastic aggressive move,” but the next few sessions matter. 29 minutes of $XRP TA. pic.twitter.com/aJ4yiC7Sdr — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) January 6, 2026 If XRP keeps printing strong daily candles and the relative pairs start closing above resistance, his $8–$12 zone framing remains a live bull-case roadmap. If not, the same overbought signals and nearby liquidity pockets increase the odds that XRP first resets through consolidation or a retracement before any larger leg can develop. At press time, XRP traded at $2.25. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin ETFs Bring The Heat: $1.2 Billion Flows In First 48 Hours—Analyst",
    "body": "Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US opened 2026 with a burst of cash that surprised some market watchers and encouraged others. Related Reading: Bitcoin Wealth Isn’t About Hype—It’s About Time And Stacking, Expert Says According to Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, more than $1.2 billion flowed into those funds during the first two trading days of the year. He estimated that if that pace held, annualized inflows could reach about $150 billion — roughly 600% higher than the total for 2025. The spot Bitcoin ETFs are “coming into 2026 like a lion,” Balchunas said. ETF Flows Surge Early According to reports, nearly every major spot Bitcoin ETF saw money coming in during those opening sessions. Balchunas calls this inflow as broad-based. The WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) was one of the few exceptions that did not register the same demand. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was reported to have taken a large share of last year’s buying. The spot bitcoin ETFs are coming into 2026 like a lion, +$1.2 in flows in first two days of year w/ everyone eating. That’s a $150b/yr pace. Told ya’ll if they can take in $22b when it’s raining, imagine when the sun is shining. pic.twitter.com/YdRaLN0Op7 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 6, 2026 Traditional Measures Fell Short Last Year Last year, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows of over $21 billion. That was down from $35 billion in 2024. Yet Monday’s single-day net inflow of $697 million was the biggest daily intake in three months, and it came as Bitcoin traded back above the low $90,000s. Trading volume rose and some positions that had bet on a price drop were closed, which added to the move. Institutional Moves And New Filings Reports show Morgan Stanley filed with the SEC to offer both Bitcoin and Solana ETFs, a step that puts a major wealth manager alongside established issuers. Balchunas pointed out Morgan Stanley manages about $8 trillion in advisory assets and has already cleared its advisors to allocate to such products. The firm’s proposed Bitcoin trust, according to the filing, would track the spot price and avoid leverage or derivatives. How The Flows Affect The Market Analysts say ETF demand is likely to soak up circulating Bitcoin supply. If sustained, that dynamic could change how much liquidity is available to traders and might reduce the amount of BTC offered on exchanges. There was an early sign of unevenness: preliminary figures showed a large outflow from one Fidelity fund on Tuesday, which raised the chance of a net outflow for the day once all data were in.

The top crypto asset kept its composure around the low $90,000s and climbed past $93,000 at moments. Traders and analysts pointed to short position liquidations and a rebound in other risk assets as reasons for the lift. Some on-chain observers flagged accumulation by larger holders, while others said markets were treating the news as concluded rather than as a fresh shock.

    "body": "Several catalysts have emerged that point to a sustained upward momentum for the Dogecoin price. This comes amid DOGE’s 26% gain to begin the year, with the meme coin now looking to break above the $0.15 resistance. Factors That Could Contribute To A Sustained Dogecoin Price Rally One factor pointing to a sustained Dogecoin price rally is the recent inflows into DOGE ETFs. SoSoValue data show that Bitwise and Grayscale’s funds have recorded net inflows on two of the three trading days this year. Notably, the Dogecoin ETFs recorded inflows of $2.30 million and $1.60 million on January 2 and 5, respectively. This marked the first consecutive daily net inflows since December 3 last year. Related Reading: Analyst Says the Worst Is Over For Dogecoin, Predicts Rally To $0.8 The daily net inflows into the DOGE ETFs indicate a renewed interest among institutional investors in the meme coin, which is a positive for the Dogecoin price. DOGE could see a sustained rally if the inflows into these funds continue. Notably, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that a 2x Dogecoin ETF has had the best start to the year among all ETFs, up almost 40%. Furthermore, activity in the derivatives market also supports a sustained rally for the Dogecoin price. CoinGlass data shows that traders on top exchanges such as Binance and OKX are currently long. The long/short ratio on Binance is 2.06, well above 1. The long/short ratio for top traders on Binance is at 2.5, which is also a huge positive. Further data from CoinGlass also shows that the derivatives trading volume has surged over 2% to $5.60 billion. However, open interest has dropped by almost 7% to $1.78 billion, likely due to the market volatility as long positions were wiped out. DOGE Eyes Break Above $0.15 Crypto analyst ZiP stated in an X post that on the daily chart, the Dogecoin price is currently reacting to a local resistance at around $0.15. He further remarked that if the $0.15 resistance breaks, the next zone that the DOGE price may aim for is around $0.24. The analyst noted that this is where the first significant Fibonacci level, measured from the entire bearish move, is located. Meanwhile, ZiP mentioned that an additional reference point is the daily pivot at $0.1288, which he noted in the short term defines the market’s equilibrium level. Crypto analyst Trader Tarigrade revealed that the Dogecoin price has broken out of a falling wedge, showing strong upward momentum. Based on this, he predicted that DOGE is ready for a major surge, although he warned that the meme coin might retrace briefly.

    "title": "Bitcoin, ETH, Dogecoin Rally Faces 3 Key Checkpoints: Bitwise CIO",
    "body": "Crypto entered 2026 with a sharp bid, and Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says the next leg higher hinges on three checkpoints that have less to do with chart patterns and more to do with market plumbing, Washington, and the broader risk backdrop. In a January 6 memo, Hougan wrote that Bitcoin and Ethereum were each up 7% year-to-date as of Monday, January 5, while higher-beta names had moved faster, Dogecoin was up 29% over the same window. The question, he argued, is whether that early strength can turn into something sustained rather than a fleeting January pop. Three Hurdles To Overcome For Bitcoin, ETH And Dogecoin Hougan’s framework starts with a memory the market would rather bury: October 10, 2025, when crypto saw what he called “the largest liquidation event in its history,” with “$19 billion in futures positions wiped out in a single day.” The mechanical damage mattered, but the psychological overhang may have mattered more. In the weeks that followed, he wrote, investors worried the cascade had “impaired major market makers and/or hedge funds—perhaps fatally,” raising the specter of forced selling as large players unwound. “One of the reasons crypto struggled to rally in Q4 was that investors worried one of these big players might have to wind down operations, a process that typically requires the forced sale of assets,” Hougan wrote. “These potential sales hung over the market like a heavy fog.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Accumulation: Data Shows Institutions Are Net Buyers Again His first hurdle, then, is simply the absence of another blow-up with similar systemic implications. On that front, he struck a notably confident tone. “The good news: If it were going to happen, it probably would have happened by now,” he wrote, adding that while “there’s no guarantee,” a firm shutting down would likely have tried “to wrap up by year’s end.” In his read, part of the early-2026 rally reflects a market that has “put October 10 in the rearview.” He labeled that hurdle a “Green Light.” The second checkpoint is legislative, and far less within the market’s control: passage of the crypto market structure bill known as the CLARITY Act. Hougan wrote the bill is “winding its way through Congress,” with the Senate “targeting January 15 for markup,” the stage where committees align drafts and try to move a final bill toward a vote. He did not present it as a clean glide path. “Hurdles remain,” he wrote, citing “competing visions of how to regulate DeFi, stablecoin rewards, and political conflicts of interest.” Still, he framed markup as a pivotal gate: if CLARITY clears that process, it would be “a huge step toward approval.” Related Reading: Bitcoin At A Crossroads: $93,500 Reclaim Holds The Key For Next Move Hougan’s core argument is about durability. “Passage of the CLARITY Act is key to the long-term future of crypto in the U.S.,” he wrote. “Without legislation, the current pro-crypto regulatory tilt at the SEC, CFTC, and other agencies could reverse under a new administration. Passage of the Act would enshrine core principles into law and provide a strong foundation for future growth.” He pointed to signals from both politics and prediction markets. White House crypto czar David Sacks, Hougan wrote, says “we are closer than ever” to passing the bill. Kalshi, he added, puts the odds at 46% by May and 82% by year’s end. Hougan’s own takeaway: “I’m cautiously optimistic.” He tagged this hurdle “Yellow Light.” The third checkpoint is the one crypto traders often prefer to dismiss, until it matters: equity-market stability. Hougan argued the market doesn’t need a roaring stock rally to support crypto, noting “crypto is not highly correlated with stocks.” But he drew a hard line around drawdowns that force broad deleveraging and risk-off positioning. “A sharp collapse—say, a 20% pullback in the S&P 500—would take the shine off of all risk assets in the short term, crypto included,” he wrote. Here, he was explicit about limits: “I can’t claim any special expertise on the equity markets.” While he noted some investors are worried about an AI bubble, he pointed to prediction markets that “see a relatively low probability of a recession in 2026 and a roughly 80% probability of S&P 500 gains.” Like the CLARITY Act, he labeled the equity backdrop a “Yellow Light.” Hougan closed by arguing the setup is constructive if those remaining yellows turn green. “There is a lot to like in the crypto market right now,” he wrote, pointing to growing institutional adoption, surging real-world use cases “like stablecoins and tokenization,” and the market “starting to feel the benefits of the pro-crypto regulatory push that started in January 2025.” If the three milestones fall into place, he added, “2026’s early momentum will have some serious legs.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,717.
