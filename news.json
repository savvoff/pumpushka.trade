    "title": "XRP’s 173-Day Theory: What Happens If This Historical Trend Plays Out Again",
    "body": "A crypto analyst has identified a recurring chart pattern centered on a 173-day cycle that previously preceded a major price expansion for XRP. Based on this pattern, the expert suggests that XRP may be approaching a similar price rally if the trend plays out as expected. XRP Historical Pattern Signals Powerful Upside Move A crypto analyst who goes by ‘Bird’ on X has drawn attention to a recurring pattern on XRP’s daily chart. His analysis compares XRP’s current price formation with the pattern that preceded the 2025 breakout, highlighting a nearly identical time cycle and chart structure. Related Reading: XRP Completes ‘Super Guppy Compression’ Against Bitcoin, Next Target Emerges On the left side of the chart, Bird noted that it took about 173 days for XRP to break after reaching its first major top in 2025. This period is clearly marked by vertical blue lines on the chart and shows price moving within a descending wedge pattern. Notably, each price rally was lower than the previous one, while support levels remained relatively stable. Trading volume during that phase also hovered around $1.8 billion, suggesting that the breakout developed under steady market participation rather than thin liquidity. On the right side of the chart, which shows XRP’s price action in the current market cycle, Bird points to a similar pattern forming. Since the July 2025 peak, XRP has spent about 173 days moving sideways within a descending wedge. Compared to the past cycle, trading volume has been much lower, averaging around $1 billion. However, the pattern’s shape and timing closely match past trends. Bird notes that XRP has not broken down despite months of severe downward pressure. Instead of falling below key support levels, the price has been squeezed into a tighter range within the same descending wedge pattern. It also held near the $1.94 level as it approached the tip of the wedge. The analyst stated that this move shows the market is not moving sideways at random but is entering a late-stage compression before a larger upward move. If historical trends hold, Bird has predicted that XRP could surge to between $4 and $4.5. With the cryptocurrency currently trading around $1.87, this would represent a surge of more than 113%. Analyst Predicts 2017 XRP Price Explosion In 2026 Despite XRP’s recent crash below $1.9, analysts still believe its price could recover and launch a strong rally. A recent analysis by market expert Steph is Crypto reflects this optimistic outlook. Related Reading: What the Triple-Tap At $1.80 Means For The XRP Price In his post on X, Steph is Crypto predicted that XRP could be on the verge of a price explosion similar to the one in 2017. At the time, the cryptocurrency recorded a powerful rally, jumping from around $0.005 to more than $0.25. If this same trend repeats, the analyst forecasts a breakout from around $2 to above $22.

    "title": "US Government Bitcoin, Crypto Theft Allegation Emerges Involving CEO’s Son",
    "body": "A new controversy has surfaced around Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets held by the US government, following allegations raised by blockchain investigator ZachXBT. Controlling Millions In Stolen Government Crypto In a series of posts on social media platform X (previously Twitter), ZachXBT accused John “Lick” Daghita of stealing millions of dollars’ worth of seized digital assets from wallets linked to the US government. John Daghita is the son of Dean Daghita, the president of CMDSS, a firm that publicly states it provides critical services to the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Defense. Related Reading: Expert Who Nailed The Bitcoin Top Now Says Buy At These Levels According to the investigation, the alleged theft came to light after a young hacker was provoked during a heated “band for band” argument on social media app Telegram. During the exchange, which was fully recorded, the individual reportedly began screen-sharing his cryptocurrency wallets while boasting about his holdings. Those wallets were later traced to more than $40 million in seized crypto assets that belonged to the US government. ZachXBT’s findings go further, claiming that the individual known online as “John (Lick)” was observed controlling wallets tied to more than $90 million in suspected illicit funds. Among those assets were cryptocurrencies linked to US government seizure addresses associated with the Bitfinex hack. In the recordings reviewed by the investigator, John is seen actively managing multiple wallet addresses while millions of dollars’ worth of Ethereum (ETH) and Tron (TRX) were moved in real time, strongly suggesting direct control over the funds. CMDSS Goes Dark, Suspect Alters Online Identities Shortly after the allegations were made public, CMDSS appeared to remove its digital footprint. The company scrubbed its website, X account, and LinkedIn page. Around the same time, John reportedly began changing his online usernames and deleting non-fungible token (NFT)-related handles from Telegram. Related Reading: XRP Ledger Congestion Could Burn 1 Billion Coins A Year, Developer Claims Despite these efforts, ZachXBT noted that John continued to taunt investigators and even sent him a small amount of ETH from one of the flagged wallets. ZachXBT stated that he plans to return those funds directly to a US government seizure address, underscoring his position that the assets belong to the government.

    "title": "US Institutions Step Back From Ethereum: Coinbase Premium Flashes Caution",
    "body": "Ethereum saw a sharp breakdown below the $2,800 level before quickly bouncing and attempting to reclaim $2,900, but the recovery still looks fragile. The sudden dip exposed how thin demand has become at key support zones, and while buyers are trying to stabilize the price, momentum remains weak. With volatility rising and sentiment turning defensive, Ethereum is entering a pivotal stretch where the next few weeks could define the broader trend for 2026. Bulls need to reclaim lost ground quickly, but repeated failures to hold higher levels suggest the market is still vulnerable to deeper downside if support breaks again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator Falls Back To Post-Bear Market Levels: Investors Approach A Key Decision Point Adding to the pressure, a key US institutional demand proxy is flashing a warning sign. The 30-day simple moving average (SMA30) of the Ethereum Coinbase Premium Index has dropped to −0.08, reaching its lowest level since early 2023. This index tracks the pricing gap between Ethereum’s USD pair on Coinbase and the USDT pair on Binance, and deep negative readings typically indicate ETH is trading at a discount on Coinbase—often interpreted as weaker demand from US-based institutional buyers. This divergence matters because positive Coinbase premiums historically support sustained upside trends in Ethereum. With that premium now at a multi-year low, ETH’s attempt to recover above $2,900 is happening without strong confirmation from US “smart money,” increasing uncertainty around the next move. Coinbase Premium Hits Multi-Year Low A CryptoQuant report highlights a key warning signal for Ethereum: the Coinbase Premium Index, which measures the price gap between ETH/USD on Coinbase and ETH/USDT on Binance. Because Coinbase is widely viewed as a proxy for US institutional activity, a deeply negative premium typically indicates ETH is trading at a discount where “smart money” is most active, while Binance—often driven by global retail and whale flow—holds relatively stronger pricing. In practical terms, this spread helps reveal where demand is coming from and whether capital flows are supportive of a sustained trend. The current downside in the premium suggests a clear lack of buying pressure from US institutions. Even if global markets on Binance are stabilizing Ethereum’s price in the short term, the absence of American demand creates a bearish divergence. This matters because positive premiums underpin major ETH rallies; they signal the US-based accumulation and deep spot demand that drive price extensions. Without that backing, rallies are more likely to fade, and rebounds can become vulnerable to renewed selling pressure. The report flags this historic premium low as a warning: despite global resilience, the market lacks the US momentum that typically fuels a strong, immediate reversal. For bulls, the priority is not only reclaiming key price levels, but also seeing confirmation through premium recovery. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Bear Mode For 83 Days: Trend Pulse Confirms Structural Weakness Ethereum Attempts To Stabilize After Sharp Breakdown Ethereum is trading near $2,897 after a sharp breakdown below $2,800 that quickly reversed, allowing price to rebound back toward the $2,900 area. While the bounce suggests buyers are still defending the lower end of the current range, the overall structure remains weak. ETH has been trending lower from its late-2025 highs, and recent recovery attempts continue to fade before triggering a sustained reversal. Technically, Ethereum is still trading below its key trend averages, which keeps pressure on bulls. The 50-period moving average (blue) is positioned above the price and is beginning to roll over, signaling weakening short-term momentum. Related Reading: XRP Distribution Phase Continues, But Funding Rates Suggest Shorts Are Overextended The 100-period moving average (green) is also above current levels and sloping downward. This reinforces that traders are selling into rallies rather than following them with fresh demand. Together, these moving average bands have become a clear resistance zone that ETH must reclaim to shift the trend back in favor of buyers. At the same time, the 200-period moving average (red) remains below the price and continues to rise gradually, acting as a long-term structural support reference. As long as ETH holds above this curve, the move looks more like a corrective phase than a full macro breakdown. For bulls, the immediate objective is reclaiming $3,000, then pushing toward $3,150–$3,250 to challenge the 50/100 MA zone. If ETH fails to stabilize, downside risk remains open toward $2,750–$2,800.

    "title": "Bitcoin Whales Are Back: 104K BTC Added As $1M Transfers Surge",
    "body": "Whale-sized Bitcoin holders are piling up more coins even as prices wobble. According to blockchain tracker Santiment, wallets holding at least 1,000 BTC added 104,340 BTC in recent weeks. Related Reading: Gold Becomes The Whale Safe Haven As Bitcoin Takes A Back Seat Reports note that total supply held by these large wallets hit 7.17 million BTC, the highest level since September 15, 2025. Mid-sized holders joined in too, adding roughly $3.21 billion worth of Bitcoin between January 10 and January 19. Small retail wallets moved the other way, offloading about 132 BTC, worth around $11.66 million. Whales Push Their Stakes Higher The numbers point to patient buying by big players. Large transfers of $1 million or more have climbed to a two-month high, which suggests heavy participants are active on the network again. According to Santiment, this kind of flow is often tied to institutions and wealthy investors moving coins between custody, exchanges, and private wallets. Some of those moves are driven by strategic choices; some are meant to secure holdings. Either way, a growing pile in whale hands changes where supply sits. Smaller holders are stepping back, while the so-called smart money increases exposure. Reports say mid-sized wallets — those holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC — were net buyers in the same stretch. 🐳 Large Bitcoin whales are accumulating at an encouraging pace, wallets with at least 1K $BTC have collectively accumulated 104,340 more coins (a +1.5% rise). Additionally, the amount of $1M+ daily transfers is back up to 2-month high levels. 🔗 Chart: https://t.co/CJOfiOBbWU pic.twitter.com/4loxDFtUdb — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 25, 2026 Price Action And Market Signals Bitcoin’s price has not matched the upbeat on-chain action. Trading was around $87,730 at one point, with intraday swings between $86,500 and $87,500. The alpha crypto asset was down about 0.5% over 24 hours and roughly 5.4% over the prior week. Volumes have ticked up, though, which makes the case that some investors are stepping in at these levels. The picture is mixed: on-chain accumulation suggests a base is being formed, but macro headlines keep the market on edge. On-Chain Strength Versus Headlines A growing stash by big holders can support a future rally if external stress eases. Yet prices move on more than Bitcoin flows. Large transfers and rising accumulation mean demand exists under the surface, but that demand has yet to fully push the market higher. Macro Risks And Market Jitters Geopolitical worries are casting a long shadow. Reports say US President Donald Trump has moved warships toward areas of tension, and prediction markets show a significant chance that the US could strike Iran by June. Trade friction with Canada over recent auto rules has raised fresh political noise, and Polymarket shows the probability of a US government shutdown above 70%. These are real risks that can lift oil, rattle markets, and sap appetite for risk assets.

    "title": "Bitcoin Breaks Below $87K As Political Risk Spikes – Liquidations Reveal The Real Driver",
    "body": "Bitcoin is hovering at a critical demand zone as the market braces for the possibility of further downside. After losing the $87,000 level, price action remains fragile, with buyers struggling to regain control and sell-side pressure intensifying during rebounds. The broader risk-off mood frames the latest drop as a response to growing macro uncertainty rather than a purely technical move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator Falls Back To Post-Bear Market Levels: Investors Approach A Key Decision Point Rising political instability in the United States appears to have acted as the near-term trigger. Prediction markets now place the probability of a new government shutdown at roughly 78%, with federal funding set to expire on January 30, 2026. As bipartisan negotiations stall, political risk is once again being priced into markets, weighing on sentiment and pushing traders toward defensive positioning. In this environment, Bitcoin broke below $87,000 and sparked a fast liquidation cascade. Data shows that around $170 million in leveraged long positions were wiped out within 60 minutes, with total long liquidations reaching roughly $320 million over the following four hours. Nearly $40 billion in total crypto market value vanished in a short span, highlighting how quickly volatility can expand when liquidity is thin. The speed and structure of the move suggest a derivatives-driven deleveraging event rather than broad spot capitulation. That distinction matters because it implies the next phase will depend on whether forced selling fades and real demand returns at this level. Liquidations And OI Reveal A Deleveraging-Led Drop A report from XWIN Research Japan explains that Bitcoin’s latest flush was likely amplified by a wave of forced liquidations in the derivatives market. Liquidations occur when futures positions fall below their maintenance margin and are automatically closed by exchanges to prevent further losses. In this case, a large share of the risk was concentrated in leveraged long positions, which are commonly used by short-term traders as well as hedging and arbitrage participants. Many of these longs were positioned for a renewed 2026 uptrend, making the market vulnerable once the price slipped under key support. When the decline accelerated, liquidation orders hit the books as market sells. Which can intensify downside moves in thin liquidity environments. To understand whether this was a structural shift or simply a leverage reset, XWIN points to Open Interest (OI). OI measures the total size of outstanding futures contracts and reflects how much leverage remains embedded in the market. When price falls alongside declining OI, it typically signals that position unwinds and liquidations are driving the move rather than a sudden change in fundamentals. On-chain estimates place aggregate OI near $28.4 billion. Well below the roughly $47 billion peak in late 2025, showing that leverage had already reduced. Still, OI has stabilized and slightly rebounded in early 2026, leaving room for volatility during corrections. The key is what comes next: whether selling fades, spot demand absorbs supply, and leverage normalizes as participation returns. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Bear Mode For 83 Days: Trend Pulse Confirms Structural Weakness Bitcoin Slides As Key Moving Averages Turn Into Resistance Bitcoin is trading near $87,820 after a steady decline that has kept the price pinned below $90,000. The structure shows BTC losing momentum after failing to hold the mid-January breakout toward $98,000. Followed by a sharp reversal that shifted market control back to sellers. Since that rejection, price has printed a sequence of lower highs, with selloffs accelerating each time BTC attempts to reclaim overhead levels. From a trend perspective, the moving averages highlight how the short-term regime has flipped bearish. BTC is now trading below the 50-period moving average (blue) near $90,300 and below the 100-period moving average (green) around $91,955, both of which are sloping downward. These levels are now acting as dynamic resistance, reinforcing the idea that traders are selling rallies. The 200-period moving average (red) sits close to $90,756, creating a tight resistance cluster between $90.3K and $92K. Bulls must reclaim this cluster to rebuild momentum. Related Reading: XRP Distribution Phase Continues, But Funding Rates Suggest Shorts Are Overextended Support is developing around the $87K–$88K zone, which has acted as a short-term demand pocket during prior pullbacks. If buyers fail to defend this area, downside risk opens toward $86,000 and potentially the mid-$84K range. BTC needs a clean reclaim of $90K, followed by consolidation above the moving-average band.

    "title": "XRP Outlook For 2026: AI Model Signals New Record Ahead — Can Price Reach $6?",
    "body": "A new artificial intelligence (AI)–driven outlook for XRP is drawing attention after market analyst Sam Daodu shared projections generated by Claude AI, outlining how the cryptocurrency could perform through the rest of 2026. The forecast presents three distinct price paths for XRP, each shaped by how key factors such as exchange-traded fund (ETF) demand, regulatory clarity, and network activity evolve. Together, the scenarios provide a broad yet structured view of where the fifth-largest cryptocurrency could be headed. Potential 215% Rally Ahead For XRP According to Daodu, Claude AI uses a baseline XRP price of roughly $2.15 and builds its projections around whether market catalysts strengthen or weaken. The model suggests that ETF inflows, exchange balance trends, and growth on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) will be the primary signals determining whether XRP breaks higher, trades sideways, or slips lower by the end of 2026. Related Reading: Global Liquidity Says Bitcoin Is Extremely Undervalued – Here’s The ‘Real’ Figure In the most optimistic scenario, Claude AI predicts XRP would rise to between $4 and $6, representing a potential 215% increase from its current trading price of $1.90. This bullish outcome depends on ETF inflows accelerating beyond $5 billion while exchange balances continue to decline, indicating reduced sell-side pressure. Under this scenario, institutional accumulation would increase spot market demand, while clearer regulatory conditions would help improve overall market sentiment. Claude’s model suggests that once XRP decisively moves above the $3.20 resistance level, tightening liquidity across major trading platforms could magnify even modest buying activity. By late 2026, long-term holders limiting supply could further thin market depth, allowing prices to rise more quickly. However, this outcome would require unexpected positive catalysts and currently sits above what most AI models are forecasting. Base Case Prediction The base case presents a more measured outlook, with XRP trading between $2.00 and $3.00. In this scenario, ETF inflows remain steady but unspectacular, while adoption grows gradually rather than explosively. The model suggests XRP would likely maintain support above $2.00, helped by manageable escrow token releases and incremental improvements to the XRPL that support ongoing transaction growth. Price swings would likely remain contained, with accumulation happening quietly instead of through sharp rallies. By the end of 2026, XRP could settle near the midpoint of this range, reflecting balanced participation from both retail traders and institutional investors. Bearish Outlook Envisions $1.50 – $1.80 On the downside, Claude AI outlines a bearish scenario in which XRP drifts toward the $1.50 to $1.80 range. This outcome would likely unfold if ETF demand weakens and broader macroeconomic pressures intensify. A sustained drop below the $2.00 level could then lead to extended consolidation around the $1.60 support zone. While network activity on the XRPL might continue, momentum in price action would fade as market participants wait for clearer catalysts. Related Reading: Gold Hits Record $5K While Bitcoin Struggles To Keep Pace Ultimately, Claude AI’s forecast points to relative stability around $2.15 in the near term for the cryptocurrency, at least through January, with larger price movements dependent on ETF market inflows exceeding the $5 billion mark. Daodu further pointed out that Claude’s outlook sits between ChatGPT’s more cautious stance and Grok’s comparatively optimistic projections, offering what he describes as a realistic middle ground rather than an extreme outcome.

    "body": "On-chain analytics firm Santiment has pointed out how XRP and Ethereum are among coins sitting in the MVRV Ratio’s “undervalued” zone. 30-Day MVRV Is Negative For XRP & Ethereum In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about where some notable cryptocurrencies like XRP and Bitcoin currently sit from the perspective of the 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio. The MVRV Ratio is a popular indicator that tells us how the market cap of a given digital asset compares against its Realized Cap. The latter is an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the asset’s total value by assuming that the value of each individual token is equal to the spot price at which it was last transacted on the network. Related Reading: Dogecoin Wedge Breakout Could Be “Powerful,” Analyst Says In short, what the Realized Cap represents is the total amount of capital that the cryptocurrency’s investors have put into it. In contrast, the usual market cap is just the value that holders are carrying in the present. Since the MVRV Ratio takes the ratio of the two, it essentially provides a look into profitability among investors as a whole. In the context of the current topic, the MVRV Ratio of only a particular segment of traders is of interest: those who purchased within the past month. Below is the chart for this version of the MVRV Ratio shared by Santiment that shows its trend across five top coins: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, and Chainlink. As is visible in the graph, the 30-day MVRV Ratio has dropped into the negative region for all five of these cryptocurrencies recently, indicating that returns of the monthly buyers have gone into the red. The analytics firm considers assets to be “undervalued” when this condition forms. “A coin having a negative percentage means average traders you’re competing with are down money, and there is an opportunity to enter while profits are below the normal ‘zero-sum game’ level,” explained Santiment. Not all tokens with a negative value on the indicator provide an equal opportunity, however. “The lower a coin’s 30-day MVRV is, the less risk there is in opening or adding on to your position,” noted the analytics firm. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply Overhang Likely To Cap Rallies Above $98,400, Glassnode Says Down to a value of -5%, Santiment defines cryptocurrencies to be in a “mildly undervalued” zone. Bitcoin has a 30-day MVRV value of 3.7%, so it falls inside this territory. Meanwhile, XRP and Ethereum have the metric sitting at -5.7% and -7.6%, putting them inside a stronger undervalued region. Out of the tokens in the chart, Chainlink’s 30-day buyers are currently in the most amount of pain with losses of 9.5%. XRP Price XRP dropped to a low of $1.8 on Sunday, but the asset has since bounced back above $1.9. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has disclosed a substantial expansion of its gold holdings, underscoring a growing shift toward hard‑asset backing amid uncertainty across crypto and traditional financial markets. Tether Expands Gold‑Backed Stablecoin Reserves Gold crossed the $5,000 per ounce threshold for the first time on Monday, a milestone that market observers had not previously seen. Prices briefly climbed to around $5,110 per ounce as safe‑haven demand accelerated. Tether revealed that it significantly increased its gold exposure during the fourth quarter of 2025. The company disclosed that gold‑backed stablecoins (XAU₮) experienced rapid growth throughout the year, with total market capitalization rising from roughly $1.3 billion to more than $4 billion. Related Reading: Expert Who Nailed The Bitcoin Top Now Says Buy At These Levels According to Tether’s attestation report, this expansion was fueled by record‑high gold prices, rising geopolitical fragmentation, and growing demand from both institutional investors and crypto‑native users for fully on‑chain safe‑haven assets. Within the gold‑backed stablecoin sector, Tether Gold emerged as the dominant issuer, accounting for approximately 60% of the total supply in circulation. By the end of the fourth quarter, total physical gold reserves stood at 520,089.350 fine troy ounces. Each token is backed on a one‑to‑one basis by a fine troy ounce of physical gold. At current prices, the total market value of these holdings reached approximately $2.25 billion. Crypto Giant Ranks Among Top 30 Global Gold Holders Tether confirmed that all gold reserves are securely stored in Switzerland and comply fully with the London Good Delivery standards established by the London Bullion Market Association, a key benchmark for institutional gold custody. The scale of Tether’s accumulation has also positioned the company among major global gold holders. Based on data from the International Monetary Fund and a Jefferies report published in late 2025, Tether now ranks within the top 30 gold holders worldwide. Its holdings surpass those of several countries, including Greece, Qatar, and Australia. During the fourth quarter of 2025 alone, Tether Gold Investments added roughly 27 metric tons of gold to its exposure. Related Reading: Crypto Traders Share Odds Of XRP Price Rising 40% This Year, Can It Still Rally? Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, said the company’s growing role in gold markets carries significant responsibility. He emphasized that Tether Gold is designed to bring clarity and verifiability at a time when confidence in traditional monetary systems is being tested. Ardoino noted that each XAU₮ token represents vaulted physical gold that can be independently verified on‑chain, adding that the product’s rapid growth reflects rising expectations for tokenized assets to meet the same standards as sovereign and institutional reserves.

    "body": "As the crypto market recovers from the latest pullback, Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to bounce from its one-month low. Some analysts have warned that the correction has left the cryptocurrency in a “fragile position” that resembles the start of the previous bear market. Related Reading: XRP At ‘Critical Inflection Point’: Analyst Signals Major Expansion If This Level Holds Bitcoin Risks 2022-Like Correction On Sunday, Bitcoin saw a 3.6% intraday decline, closing the day below its yearly opening for the first time. Since November, the flagship crypto has been hovering between $86,000-$93,500 in the weekly timeframe, failing to turn the range’s resistance into support despite multiple attempts. During the early January breakout, BTC climbed 11.5% from its $87,600 2026 opening price, reaching a two-month high of $97,924 nearly two weeks ago. Since then, the cryptocurrency has erased all its recent gains, diving below this key area and closing the week at the base of its range. Amid this performance, Market observer Philarekt affirmed that Bitcoin is repeating its 2022 playbook, highlighting the similarities between the leading crypto’s performance at the start of the last bear market and its current price action. As the chart shows, the cryptocurrency formed a bear flag pattern after the initial drop from its cycle top of $69,000. At the time, the cryptocurrency tested and rejected the 100-day Moving Average (MA), leading to a pullback towards the pattern’s lower boundary. This was followed by a rebound towards the formation’s upper boundary, where the 200-day MA was located, and a rejection from this area, which led to a breakdown from the pattern and 55% correction. This time, Bitcoin has rejected from the 100-day MA and is currently retesting the pattern’s support line. Based on this, he suggested that the flagship crypto could see one more leg up toward the 200-day MA, located around the $100,000 barrier, before “the real show” begins. BTC Price In Precarious Position Meanwhile, Rekt Capital explained that Bitcoin was in a “particularly fragile position,” as it needed to hold the previous week’s marginal close above the range high. “When Weekly Closes occur marginally beyond a key level, the subsequent retest becomes structurally precarious,” he detailed. In his analysis, the market watcher noted that Bitcoin saw a sharp rejection from the $98,000 region, where the 21-week and 50-week Bull Market Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are located. This coincided with the loss of a higher low structure that had been building similarly to 2021. “Losing that Higher Low is significant, as it removes a key structural buffer that could have supported continued consolidation within the Weekly Range,” he asserted. The rejection has shifted focus to the strength of the $86,000 support and the character of the upcoming rebounds from this area. He warned that shallower bounces from the range lows would suggest weakening demand, increasing the chances of a breakdown below this support. Related Reading: Crypto Traders Share Odds Of XRP Price Rising 40% This Year, Can It Still Rally? Strong rejections that lead to downside continuation historically tend to occur later in the cycle toward the end of Q1 or the start of Q2, Rekt Capital pointed out, but Bitcoin is already testing the lower boundary of its weekly range. This adds “importance to the integrity of this support, as any early breakdown would represent a shift relative to that typical timing.” At the moment, the weekly range remains pivotal, “acting as the key decision point between a prolonged relief structure and the risk of deeper downside,” the analyst concluded.

    "title": "Why Is Bitcoin Lagging Gold And Silver? Anthony Pompliano Explains",
    "body": "Gold and silver have gone on a record-setting tear in recent months, ripping through fresh all-time highs, while Bitcoin has been stuck grinding sideways in a tight $84,000–$94,000 box since mid-November. In a January 27 video posted to X, Anthony Pompliano argued the gap is less about a single catalyst and more about shifting demand drivers, market structure, and a new fight for attention and risk capital. Pompliano framed the disconnect with blunt scorekeeping. “We have gold, which is up 80% in the last year. Silver’s up 250%, copper’s up 40%, and platinum’s up nearly 200% over the last 12 months,” he said, before turning to the contrast: “At the same exact time, Bitcoin is down 16% over the last year.” In his telling, the metals aren’t moving as a monolith, they’re responding to different sources of demand. Gold, he said, is benefiting from central banks accumulating reserves and what he described as “a definitization of the global economy,” where flows rotate out of dollars not into other fiat, but into gold. Silver, by contrast, is less about store-of-value positioning and more about industrial pull. Pompliano pointed to defense equipment, AI hardware, and self-driving cars as examples of end-demand, arguing that “the world is building things again” and that re-industrialization makes silver a direct beneficiary. Related Reading: Expert Who Nailed The Bitcoin Top Now Says Buy At These Levels Copper and platinum, in his framework, are even cleaner industrial stories. Copper rides electrification (EVs, grid buildouts, renewables) and “significant industrial demand.” Platinum’s move, he argued, is supply constrained, describing “very, very low supply” that creates a market structure favorable to holders. Pompliano also highlighted what he called a rotation within metals where gold led, then silver, and more recently copper and platinum, a sequence he dubbed “the metals mania.” So Why Hasn’t Bitcoin Joined The Run? Pompliano’s first answer was structural: Wall Street’s adoption is changing who holds Bitcoin and how it trades. He described an “IPO moment of Bitcoin,” (referring to Jordy Visser’s theory), where long-term holders have been handing coins off to institutional players. In Pompliano’s view, some early holders owned Bitcoin precisely because it was “outside the system,” and the asset’s migration into mainstream finance may reduce enthusiasm from that cohort. He also pointed to public comments from Peter Thiel and others suggesting Bitcoin’s future may be less “asymmetric” than its early years. The second structural shift is the proliferation of financial instruments around BTC. “It used to be really hard to short Bitcoin. Well, now you can do it very simply,” Pompliano said, arguing that options and shorting change the market’s plumbing and dampen volatility. “Bitcoin used to be an 80 vol asset. Now it’s more like a 40 vol asset,” he added, positioning the trade-off as fewer parabolic upside phases but also fewer catastrophic drawdowns. From there, Pompliano moved to narrative demand — specifically, the idea that Bitcoin had been treated as a “chaos hedge.” He argued that recent perceptions of rising geopolitical stability have reduced the perceived need for that insurance bid, while central banks, with far larger pools of capital, continue to express their hedge preference through gold. “It seems like there is not as much of a bid for Bitcoin coming as this insurance hedge,” he said, stressing he viewed it as a flow and narrative issue rather than a loss of utility. Related Reading: Global Liquidity Says Bitcoin Is Extremely Undervalued – Here’s The ‘Real’ Figure He made a similar point about inflation hedging, claiming disinflation has undercut one of Bitcoin’s most effective recent narratives. Citing Trueflation, Pompliano said the metric showed 1.2% inflation, “150 basis points lower than it was just 90 days ago,” and argued that AI and tariffs are deflationary forces. If investors don’t expect inflation to run hot, he reasoned, some capital simply won’t reach BTC. Finally, he argued Bitcoin is losing mindshare and speculative oxygen to AI and to a broader set of “risk-taking” outlets. “There is simply more competition,” Pompliano said, extending the idea beyond markets into an attention economy where every asset competes when users open a financial app and decide where to allocate leftover cash. In that framing, Bitcoin is no longer the default high-upside wager for younger participants; it’s competing with AI equities, prediction markets, and sports betting. Why is bitcoin lagging while gold, silver, copper, and platinum continue to go higher? I break down the forces driving the metals rally, how Wall Street adoption has reshaped Bitcoin’s market structure, and why inflation expectations, global stability, and AI are influencing… pic.twitter.com/VzATl6ZCYi — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) January 27, 2026 Pompliano’s closing message was that laggards can catch up and that he sees Bitcoin as “more interesting sitting at $87,000 than it was at $126,000.” But he also cautioned that a lower-volatility, more institutional Bitcoin may demand a different temperament from holders. “If you actually get impatient, you’re going to be disappointed. You’re going to get shaken out,” he said, arguing that the trade increasingly resembles a waiting game rather than a yearly sprint. At press time, BTC traded at $88,131.

    "title": "What Davos Revealed About BlackRock, Ripple And XRP: Pundits Weigh In",
    "body": "A panel of XRP-focused commentators is leaning heavily into Davos optics as evidence that BlackRock and Ripple are converging on a shared vision for tokenized finance, even as none of the participants produced direct confirmation of a formal partnership between the two firms. BlackRock, Ripple And XRP After Davos Host Versan Aljarrah opened by pointing to “BlackRock and Brad Garlinghouse at Davos,” asking guest Jake Claver what he took from their presence and the “conclusion they had over there.” Claver’s answer centered on what he said he heard from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink about settlement consolidation. “He mentioned that it would be ideal if everything was on one blockchain or at least settled back to one blockchain,” Claver said. “For Ripple to be in the room and having been in the room for years at this point, it gives me you know a lot of confidence that it is the XRPL I feel like BlackRock and Ripple are much more involved than people realize.” Today we’re joined by @beyond_broke to discuss BlackRock’s quiet ties with Ripple, the soft disclosures around XRP, and the future of digitization and tokenization. Excited to have everyone back together for this one.https://t.co/oMHGWqMehB pic.twitter.com/u1s7LyOAhs — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) January 26, 2026 Aljarrah immediately widened the claim beyond Davos stagecraft, asserting, “it’s quite obvious at this point that Blackrock, JP Morgan, Ripple and all these major banks they have some ties to Ripple [and] XRP,” before returning to the recurring theme that Davos access itself is a filter. Later, he argued that the set of crypto-native executives allowed near institutions like the WEF and BIS was narrowing and that Garlinghouse’s inclusion mattered more than “headline hype.” Related Reading: ‘I’m Very Bullish’: Ripple CEO Forecasts Record Performance For Crypto In 2026 David (Digital Outlook) pushed the discussion toward implementation, but repeatedly brought BlackRock back into the frame as a connective thread in Ripple’s institutional strategy. “When it came out to like, okay, has Ripple really positioned themselves to be like […] the main leader in the space […] with the acquisitions that they’ve made […] custody with Palisade,” he said. “I think they got Metaco and Standard Custody in there […] clearance through Hidden Road, all that. Then […] you see all these other linkages between their partners like what they’re doing with Blackrock. You know, they’ve got some stuff going on there.” A second line of argument was that BlackRock’s eventual entry could be the trigger for an XRP liquidity event. Edo Farina framed it in “order size” terms: “It takes one huge institutional order from a Blackrock a great scale and that’s it,” he said, claiming market pricing can stay muted if institutional positioning happens through OTC arrangements. Related Reading: Ripple Builds XRP ‘Wall Street Kit’: Developer Claims ‘Billions Incoming’ Claver added: “When Blackrock steps in, there will be likely a supply shock that allows XRP to decouple from the rest of the crypto market and Bitcoin,” and tied that idea to a viral episode the panel said briefly moved XRP out of sync with the rest of crypto. “We’ve seen it decoupled once […] when […] the [fake] trust that had been filed in Delaware for Blackrock’s iShares XRP ETF […] hit Twitter,” Claver said. Still, BlackRock’s observable crypto footprint still tilts towards Ethereum and Bitcoin rather than XRP. BlackRock’s flagship US spot exposure is via products tracking bitcoin and ether, IBIT and ETHA, while its tokenization beachhead has also been Ethereum-first: BlackRock’s BUIDL fund debuted on Ethereum via Securitize in March 2024, and only later expanded to additional networks. Also, BlackRock’s own 2026 thematic outlook is explicitly naming Ethereum as the infrastructure layer that “collects the toll” as tokenization scales, with stablecoins treated as an early proxy for tokenization “in action.” BlackRock highlights data indicating “65%+” of tokenized assets sit on Ethereum, an argument for why “one blockchain” speculation often defaults to ETH in institutional circles. At press time, XRP traded at $1.88. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Bitcoin has reaffirmed its bearish structure after strong rejection near $98,000, signaling that sellers remain firmly in control. With key resistance holding and momentum tilting lower, traders are now shifting focus to where the price could head next if the downside continues to unfold. Neckline Rejection Locks In A Bearish Bias Crypto analyst Crypto Patel, in a recent post on X, pointed out that Bitcoin has firmly rejected the $94,000–$98,000 neckline resistance, a move that reinforces a bearish market structure. The rejection signals that sellers remain firmly in control, with the failure to reclaim this zone preventing any meaningful shift in momentum. Related Reading: Global Liquidity Says Bitcoin Is Extremely Undervalued – Here’s The ‘Real’ Figure From a technical standpoint, Patel noted that Bitcoin has confirmed a failed Head and Shoulders pattern, followed by a bear-flag breakdown. This sequence strengthens the bearish outlook, as the price action continues to respect lower highs while struggling beneath key resistance. As long as BTC remains capped below the neckline, the broader trend remains decisively bearish. Looking ahead, Patel emphasized that price action below the $90,000 level favors further downside continuation. Based on the measured move from the breakdown, Bitcoin could slide toward the $75,000–$70,000 support region, representing a potential decline of around 22% from current levels. On the flip side, Patel stressed that a bullish bias would only return if Bitcoin manages a strong reclaim and acceptance above $92,000. Until that happens, any upside attempts are likely to be short-lived, making rallies opportunities for selling rather than signs of a trend reversal. $89,000: The Fuse For A Potential Bitcoin Short Squeeze According to another Bitcoin post shared by Ardi, the $89,000 level stands out as a critical threshold for any potential shift in momentum. A decisive break above this zone could begin to trigger short-squeeze conditions, as bearish positions that entered lower start to feel pressure and cover. Related Reading: Expert Who Nailed The Bitcoin Top Now Says Buy At These Levels He further emphasized that $90,300 remains the primary gatekeeper for the market. A strong reclaim and sustained acceptance above this level would signal improving bullish control, allowing price to move higher in search of the $92,000 liquidity band, where a concentration of stops and resting orders is likely positioned. On the downside, Ardi noted that liquidity near $86,000 has already been taken, suggesting that immediate downside targets have been largely satisfied. With that sweep complete, attention now shifts to whether bulls can push through overhead resistance and force late bears to exit, setting the stage for a sharper upside reaction.

    "title": "Dogecoin Price Just Confirmed A Reversal With The RSI Divergence",
    "body": "Dogecoin’s price action on the daily timeframe is starting to show early signs that the downtrend may be losing momentum. The king of meme coins has been trading with months of declining price movement, but technical analysis shows it is now printing a technical setup that might become a turning point. A developing double-bottom structure combined with a clear RSI divergence is shifting attention back to the possibility of a reversal, even as Dogecoin’s price action is compressed near long-term support around $0.12. RSI Divergence Shows Weakening Bearish Momentum The most notable development comes from the Relative Strength Index on the daily chart. Technical analysis shows that while Dogecoin’s price is now revisiting the same support region around the $0.12 zone, the RSI failed to make a new low. Instead, it formed a higher low, which created a bullish divergence between momentum and price. Related Reading: The Macro Wave 5 Move THat Could Trigger 3,000% For Dogecoin Price This divergence shows that sellers are no longer pushing price lower with the same strength seen earlier in the downtrend. This development is notable because similar RSI behavior has often preceded relief rallies for Dogecoin when paired with strong structural support. Furthermore, Dogecoin’s price action appears to be creating a double bottom along the lower boundary of a descending channel, as shown in the chart below. This type of structure is pointing to exhaustion on the sell side behind the scenes. The longer Dogecoin’s price holds above this base, the stronger the argument becomes that accumulation is taking place. The reversal outlook is based on whether Dogecoin can reclaim and hold above $0.16. A confirmed move above it would validate the RSI divergence and double bottom, although it won’t be until Dogecoin is able to break above $0.31 that the real rally will begin. Fractal Points To An Incoming Expansion Technical analysis of Dogecoin’s higher-timeframe chart introduces a compelling historical parallel that sees the memecoin pushing well above $0.31. Particularly, Dogecoin is printing a fractal on the weekly candlestick chart that looks like one that preceded a 331% breakout in late 2024. Related Reading: Dogecoin RSI Just Entered Historical Oversold Levels Again, Will It Repeat 2021? In that prior instance, Dogecoin spent months grinding lower, formed a rounded basing structure, and then launched into a near-vertical move once momentum flipped. The current structure shows a similar rounded recovery attempt followed by a controlled pullback into long-term support. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1221. As shown in the chart below, the current price action is now sitting at the base of what could be the next vertical leg higher if the fractal continues to play out as expected. Although there is still a need for confirmation, these analyses indicate that Dogecoin may be transitioning out of its corrective phase and positioning for a much larger move ahead.
