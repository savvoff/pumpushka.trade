    "title": "Bitcoin Cycle Defined by Demand, Not Price: CryptoQuant Head Says",
    "body": "Head of research at on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has explained how demand makes the basis of a Bitcoin cycle, rather than price performance. Bitcoin Apparent Demand Has Been Declining Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno has talked about Bitcoin cycles from a different lens. “Most are focusing on price performance to define a cycle, when it is demand what they should be looking to,” noted Moreno. Related Reading: XRP At Risk Of A Drop To $0.80? Analyst Makes The Case The analyst has gauged the “demand” for the cryptocurrency using the Apparent Demand indicator, which compares the daily miner issuance against the changes in the 1-year dormant supply. The first of these, the miner issuance, is the amount that miners are “minting” on the network every day by receiving block rewards. This metric essentially reflects the “production” of the asset. The 1-year inactive supply, on the other hand, can be thought of as the cryptocurrency’s “inventory.” Thus, the Apparent Demand basically compares the production of Bitcoin against changes taking place in its inventory. Below is the chart shared by Moreno that shows the trends in the 30-day and 1-year versions of the Apparent Demand over the past decade. As is visible in the graph, the last few Bitcoin cycles have all transitioned into a bear market when the Apparent Demand has plunged into the negative region on both the monthly and yearly timeframes. In the current cycle, the 30-day Apparent Demand has plunged into the red zone recently, suggesting that the monthly demand for the asset has been negative. On the annual scale, the metric is still at a positive level, but its value has been following a downtrend. If this decline keeps up, it won’t be long before the indicator has dipped into the negative territory. Considering the pattern from the previous cycles, the current structure in the Apparent Demand is certainly looking bearish. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the yearly version of the metric will cross into the red zone or if it will rebound, signaling the return of demand. Spot demand isn’t the only way to measure Bitcoin demand these days. With the advent of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), there has been some fresh off-chain demand coming into the cryptocurrency this cycle.

BTC Price Bitcoin has taken to consolidation recently as its price is still floating around the $88,000 level. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, CryptoQuant.com, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin Long-Term Bullish Structure Still In Play And Will Cross $10",
    "body": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is back in focus as long-term chart structures continue to signal sustained bullish potential. While recent monthly price action has remained muted, a crypto analyst maintains that the meme coin’s broader technical trend has not been compromised. The analyst has projected that DOGE could eventually rally toward a long-term move beyond the $10 level. Dogecoin Bullish Structure Points Toward $10 On December 31, crypto market expert Olivier D Maximus posted on X that Dogecoin remains structurally bullish and could eventually cross $10. He noted that although price action has been slow and unimpressive, DOGE’s bullish framework continues to favor higher valuations in the long term. Related Reading: 7-Period Fractal Trend Says Dogecoin Price Is Headed To $10 He shared a new detailed chart analysis, indicating that DOGE’s monthly close generated little short-term excitement. However, he emphasized that the broader bullish framework remains intact, with attention now turning to what January may bring as the next decisive phase. Maximus pointed out that long-term structures often move quietly before big gains, and Dogecoin appears to be following this pattern. He stressed that patience is required when analyzing higher time frames, as monthly charts tend to capture macro trends rather than immediate volatility. In his view, the current consolidation does not invalidate Dogecoin’s upside thesis. The analyst’s chart showed Dogecoin trading within a clearly defined Ascending Channel that has held for several years. The meme coin’s price remains above the long-term rising support zone, reflecting higher lows over time. Additionally, multiple diagonal trend lines show that DOGE’s price has repeatedly corrected toward mid-channel support before resuming upward movement. These pullbacks appear controlled, reinforcing the possibility of a healthy long-term uptrend. Maximus has also spotlighted several ATH levels he expects Dogecoin to reach over time. The ascending channel seen on the chart points toward potential targets above $12, extending as high as $25. Moreover, the analyst has suggested that if Dogecoin maintains its structural integrity, future trends could push the meme coin into double-digit territory, making a surge from under $1 to $10 technically plausible. DOGE Enters Make Or Break Zone In 2026 In a separate X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade revealed that the Dogecoin price is currently trading within a Descending Triangle, with the price sitting at the tip of the pattern around $0.122. This level has been highlighted as a potential make-or-break point where a pullback or surge could determine Dogecoin’s next big move. Related Reading: What The Rise In Open Interest Means For The Dogecoin Price If price breaks above the upper boundary of the Descending Triangle, Trader Tardigrade predicts that Dogecoin could experience a breakout to the upside. He has set a target of around $0.132, representing a surge of approximately 8.2% from the current price level. On the other hand, if DOGE breaks below the lower boundary of the triangle, the meme coin could tumble further toward $0.116, representing a roughly 4.9% crash.

    "title": "Austin Arnold Unveils His Top 6 Crypto Altcoin Picks For 2026",
    "body": "Altcoin Daily host Austin Arnold used a Jan. 1 video titled “Top 6 Crypto Altcoins To Invest In For 2026” to lay out what he framed as three “first-time” catalysts for crypto in 2026 and a corresponding list of six altcoins he says he’d “buy and hold” into that backdrop, spanning smart-contract platforms, AI infrastructure, and tokenization-focused plays. Arnold opened with the claim that crypto sits at the center of “two mega trends”: digital assets and the tokenization of financial assets and argued the combination of macro policy, US legislation, and SEC posture could drive “trillions of dollars” of new inflows. The 3 Bullisch Crypto Catalysts First, Arnold pointed to what he described as a monetary-policy regime shift, including the resumption of “reserve management purchases,” and framed it as supportive for risk assets broadly. “We’re starting to see significant stimulus,” he said, adding that markets were already seeing “quantitative easing light” as “the Fed is starting to buy its own bonds,” while suggesting demand for government debt could fall alongside lower rates. Related Reading: Scaramucci Picks His Top 3 Crypto Altcoins As Rate-Cut Tailwinds Build Second, he argued crypto-specific regulation could function like a green light for institutional capital. He singled out the market structure focused Clarity Act, saying its passage would be “like a starter gun for ETH and SOL to run into trillions of dollars of value,” and noted discussion of a US Senate markup date of Jan. 15 with hopes of movement by late January or February. Third, Arnold highlighted what he called a tokenization push led by SEC chair Paul Atkins, describing “Project Crypto” as an effort to “bring all of traditional finance on the blockchain.” He paired that theme with a distribution angle around spot crypto ETFs, leaning on a quote he cited about how unusual the early ETF growth was: “These were the single best-selling product in the world and no one was allowed to make a phone call to sell it or advertise it,” he said. Top 6 Crypto Altcoins To Invest In For 2026 Arnold’s first pick is Ethereum. He frames it as the primary beneficiary of stablecoin growth and added that stablecoins are “mostly on the Ethereum blockchain,” and tied the thesis to regulation via the Genius Act, citing a view that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expects the sector to grow “10x in the next few years.” Arnold also said Ethereum’s stablecoin share rose to 53% from the high-40s “just a few months” earlier, and argued the link to ETH value accrual runs through fees: “30% of all fees on Ethereum are actually stablecoin revenue,” he said. “So as this is 10x’es the amount of fees, the amount of Ethereum being burned should be 10x to match.” Arnold’s second pick was Solana, which he portrayed as a usage leader relative to its market value versus Ethereum. He argued Solana is “already one of or if not the most used chain in crypto,” and claimed that through 2025 it was “more used than the entire rest of the industry combined times 2 to three.” He also cited a real-world asset milestone, saying Solana “RWA holders…have surpassed 125,000 holders.” Cardano is next, which Arnold said had a weak 2025 but could benefit from founder Charles Hoskinson’s push around Midnight. Arnold played a longer excerpt in which Hoskinson argued privacy could be the wedge that changes user behavior: “They can go through Midnight to Cardano and they get privacy. They do something new and different,” Hoskinson said. “Midnight my view will be through hybrid applications… private prediction markets, private DEXes, private stable coins… maybe… those Bitcoin people are going to want to trade on a private DEX instead of a public DEX.” Related Reading: Crypto ETFs Defy The Pullback With $32 Billion In Fresh Investor Cash Arnold then shifted to AI infrastructure with Bittensor (TAO), calling it “decentralized AI” plumbing and noting it had a recent “halving” and a fixed supply model he compared to Bitcoin’s. He also pointed to early-2026 ETF momentum, saying Grayscale filed an S-1 for a TAO product and Bitwise followed with a Bittensor ETF filing. For tokenization exposure, Arnold highlighted Ondo Finance (ONDO) ahead of what he described as an Ondo Summit on Feb. 3, where “world leaders, investors, policy makers” would reconvene, and closed his list with Propy, a real-estate-focused project he said is “US licensed” for title and escrow closing and “backed by Coinbase,” positioning it as a bet on bringing home buying and selling “on-chain.” Arnold closed his list with Propy, explicitly flagging it as the most speculative end of the spectrum and pairing it with a warning that lower-cap exposure can mean “these altcoins go to zero.” The Altcoin Daily host described it as “essentially real estate on-chain.” He emphasized operational and regulatory positioning as part of the pitch, saying Propy is “US licensed title and escrow closing,” and also highlighted its backers: “They’re backed again by Coinbase.” The investment thesis, as Arnold presented it, is straightforward tokenization logic applied to housing: bringing parts of the buying and selling process onto rails that can be settled and recorded on-chain, with Propy positioned as a project already operating within the US compliance perimeter he expects to matter more in 2026. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $2.98 trillion. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Crypto analyst Crypto Whale has explained why the Bitcoin price could still crash to as low as $25,000. The analyst also stated this would form the macro bottom for the leading crypto, as it recovers from this bear market. Why The Bitcoin Price Could Drop To As Low As $25,000 In an X post, Crypto Whale stated that the monthly chart suggested that the Bitcoin price could form a macro bottom near $25,000 sometime in 2026. The analyst further remarked that if history rhymes, these deep retracements tend to mark long-term accumulation zones. He added that this doesn’t signify the end of the cycle but the reset before the next expansion. However, in another X post, Crypto Whale suggested that the Bitcoin price isn’t yet in a bear market, highlighting how the 2026 bull run is likely to unfold. He stated that this month, the crypto market will see a Bitcoin-led rally, while there will be a broad altcoin expansion in February. The analyst expects the bull trap to set in in March, which he predicts would lead to volatility and panic selling. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Why The Bitcoin Price Is Extremely Bearish Right Now Once that happens, Crypto Whale predicts that May will usher in the capitulation phase, while a full bear market confirmation will happen in June. This outlook for the Bitcoin price comes as research firm XWIN Research noted that BTC has not clearly entered a new bullish trend. The firm further stated that the crypto market remains in a high-volatility range environment, which is neither decisively bullish nor bearish. Meanwhile, XWIN Research raised the possibility that the Bitcoin price could drop to as low as $50,000. They stated that this could happen if recession risks intensify, with deleveraging and ETF outflows pushing the leading crypto below $80,000 and making $50,000 a possibility. BTC Death Cross Signals Drop To $38,000 In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez drew attention to a death cross, which has been recurring on the BTC weekly chart. The analyst noted that if history repeats itself, the Bitcoin price could record a similar 50% to 60% correction, dropping to as low as $38,000 in the process. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters Decision Phase, But What Does It Mean For The Crypto Market? This death cross between the 10-week and 50-week simple moving averages is said to have occurred in September 2014, leading to a Bitcoin price correction of 67%. It also occurred in June 2018, March 2020, and January 2022, resulting in price corrections of 54%, 53%, and 64%, respectively. Martinez opined that the zone between $50,000 and $38,000 is starting to become interesting from a long-term spot accumulation standpoint. He added that the market will confirm the next move for the Bitcoin price in its own time. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $88,700, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pngtree, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "In a development that could accelerate the evolution of cross-border financial infrastructure, JPMorgan’s GTreasury initiative on the XRP Ledger signals a potential turning point for global payments. JPMorgan’s move challenges long-standing assumptions about the role of banks in digital asset settlement and the increasing legitimacy of the XRP Ledger as a foundation for real-world transaction flows. What JP Morgan has done with GTreasury using the XRP Ledger will change payments forever. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull has revealed on X that when JPMorgan moves, it’s never for show. This was a direct integration into Ripple’s stack, allowing the Ledger to transition from Crypto Rails into the real-world plumbing for global banking. What This Means For XRP And The Broader Digital Asset Market This isn’t about transaction volume; it’s about signal, and the GTreasury system migrates only when the infrastructure is proven safe, fast, and scalable. Ripple didn’t chase relevance; it built infrastructure before the banks arrived. This integration reframes the altcoin to become a foundational layer, not a speculative asset reacting to market sentiment. Related Reading: How XRP’s Utility Will Drive Price Appreciation In The New Year The fundamentals of the XRP Ledger continue to grow massively without noise. An analyst known as Vet highlighted that while other ecosystems are struggling to fix their consensus and unique native approach for a multi-currency ledger, XRPL remains the best-in-class. The network continues to attract high-quality validators and deeply technical community members more than ever before. Education and accessibility have also reached a level where Tap has been well-designed for individuals with the apps and the XRPL.org site. On the protocol side, security has been taken to the next level with formal specifications and formal verification, which is bleeding-edge technology in crypto already used in military and aerospace systems. The payment engine is already specified, and the compliance features with DID, Credentials, and upcoming permissioned domains/DEX functionality are enabling Ripple payments to operate directly on XRPL DEX infrastructure. In addition, Evernorth $1 billion involvement in XRP is aimed at generating yield. Meanwhile, XRP ETFs continue to grow, with issuers reporting high long-term conviction among their investors in the altcoin. Even a quantum-proof encrypted XRPL test net already exists. This is a grind that involves patience, but the trajectory is upward, which has been up. How The XRPL Fits Institutional Portfolio Architecture According to the XRP Update on X (formerly Twitter), Franklin Templeton, a $1.53 trillion global asset manager, has publicly identified the XRP Ledger and XRP as a foundational building block for digital asset portfolios.

    "title": "Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Altcoins Post Another Losing Year: Analyst",
    "body": "Altcoins closed 2025 weaker versus Bitcoin, marking a fourth consecutive year of underperformance. According to market data that tracks the TOTAL3/BTC ratio — which measures all altcoins excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum against Bitcoin — the ratio finished lower for calendar years 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025. That streak has left traders and fund managers rethinking the old pattern where smaller tokens would often surge after Bitcoin rallies. Related Reading: Crypto ETFs Defy The Pullback With $32 Billion In Fresh Investor Cash Altcoins Underperform Bitcoin Market watchers say Bitcoin’s share of the overall crypto market has grown. Bitcoin dominance was reported at roughly 59–60% during the late 2025 selloff, a level that squeezed room for other tokens. Based on reports, small-cap tokens hit their lowest point in four years as money flowed into larger, more liquid assets. Bitcoin itself slipped from an October peak and ended the year in negative territory, a development covered by major outlets that noted it was the first yearly loss for Bitcoin since 2022. Altcoins have now dropped against Bitcoin for 4 years in a row pic.twitter.com/K3rJhSh1tM — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) January 1, 2026 Widespread Losses And Heavy Market Moves Several data providers found the median performance among the top 30 altcoins was negative for the year. Market value across the crypto sector fell sharply in late 2025, with some estimates saying more than $1 trillion was erased from total market capitalization during the downturn. Traders described 2025 as a year that began with optimism but closed with broad losses, and many small tokens that rose earlier in the year gave those gains back when risk appetite faded. What Analysts Are Saying Some analysts argue that institutional flows and investor preference for liquidity were important drivers of this trend. Others point to macro pressures in the US and global markets that reduced appetite for speculative positions. Reports note that for an altcoin rebound to beat Bitcoin again, fresh capital would need to rotate specifically into smaller tokens, rather than simply following Bitcoin’s moves. That shift has not been evident so far as 2026 unfurls. The TOTAL3/BTC measure is being used by many traders to gauge altcoin strength versus Bitcoin. When that ratio falls year after year, it means a unit of Bitcoin buys more altcoin market cap than before. Market trackers used by exchanges and analytics firms flagged the persistent downward trend across the last four calendar years, which is an unusual run relative to prior cycles when altcoins sometimes outpaced Bitcoin for parts of a market cycle. Related Reading: Crypto Exchange Korbit Fined $1.90 Million By South Korean Regulators Cautious Stance Investors are staying cautious. Volatility remains high and liquidity can dry up fast in smaller tokens, which makes large moves possible both ways. Based on reports, any meaningful restoration of altcoin gains will likely require clear, sustained capital flows and improved market sentiment. Until that happens, Bitcoin’s share of market capital will probably remain elevated, keeping pressure on smaller tokens. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "The XRP price has been put back in the spotlight as a crypto analyst has forecasted an even more ambitious target than the widely circulated $100 projections currently gaining traction in the market. According to the analyst, XRP has just reached a critical trendline that could trigger a surge toward a Pi Cycle Top. He has shared a detailed chart outlining a roadmap for this bullish price outlook. Analyst Shares Bold $300 XRP Price Prediction A crypto analyst known on X as @Cryptobilbuwoo0 has released a fresh update on XRP, examining its long-term cycle behaviour in 2026. He predicts that the XRP price could surge dramatically, potentially rising from its current low below $2 to as high as $300. Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Will Shine In The New Year Backing his bold forecast, the analyst noted that XRP recently touched a major green support line on its chart and is now showing early signs of a bullish reversal. He explained that this interaction with support has raised the question of whether the price action is repositioning for a new Pi Cycle Top, a signal typically associated with extreme market peaks. Notably, the chart shared alongside the analysis shows XRP price data stretching from 2014 into future projections beyond 2026. Price action is contained within a rising channel defined by white parallel trendlines, with the green line marking the lower boundary of the long-term support. Previously, whenever XRP reached this green support line, a breakout phase followed shortly. These breakouts often triggered explosive rallies that climbed through the rising channel and peaked near Pi Cycle top markers placed at earlier highs. On the right side of the chart, the crypto expert has highlighted several price targets, including $20, $100, $300, and $1000. The $300 level is near the top of the rising channel, indicating where a future Pi Cycle top could form if XRP follows its historical path. The momentum indicator at the bottom of the chart also shows upward oscillations, with the analyst’s projections for XRP extending deep into 2026 and beyond. Why A $300 XRP Price Might Not Be Feasible While the possibility of XRP reaching $300 is supported by @Cryptobilbuwoo0’s technical analysis, the cryptocurrency is currently trading at $1.83–more than 99% below the projected target. For XRP to achieve such an explosive surge, favorable market conditions would need to align, including stronger investment sentiment and sustained buying pressure.

Its value has been declining and consolidating at lower levels for several months, while overall market sentiment has turned negative. This is reflected in XRP’s Fear and Greed Index, which currently indicates more fear than confidence among investors. Even analysts like Nick, a known crypto crusader and researcher, have stated that XRP is unlikely to reach $100 by the end of 2026. Based on his assessment, a $300 price projection appears even less attainable. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",
