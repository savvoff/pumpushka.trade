    "title": "Dogecoin Price Could Rally To All-Time Highs If It Breaks This Resistance Level",
    "body": "Crypto analyst BALO has predicted that the Dogecoin price could still rally to new all-time highs (ATHs) despite its decline last year. He revealed what level DOGE needs to reclaim to trigger this massive breakout that could lead to new highs. Dogecoin Price Eyes Rally To ATH With Reclaim Of This Level In an X post, BALO stated that a reclaim of $0.13 could trigger a massive breakout for the Dogecoin price and could lead to a new all-time high (ATH) for the top meme coin. His statement came just before DOGE reclaimed this level, rallying double digits in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Dogecoin Long-Term Bullish Structure Still In Play And Will Cross $10 The Dogecoin price rallied alongside other meme coins, with PEPE leading the way with a daily gain of as much as 35%. With DOGE now back above $0.13, a new all-time high could be on the cards, as BALO predicted. His accompanying chart showed that the meme coin could reach a yearly high of around $0.44 this year, then rally to a new ATH of $0.74 in 2027. Crypto analyst Neo offered a more bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, suggesting it could rally to as high as $35. In an X post, the analyst highlighted an ascending trendline for DOGE, with the middle of the trendline placing the meme coin at $4, and the target at the top of the trendline at $35. Neo alluded to DOGE’s historical performance, noting that in 2021, the Dogecoin price surged from the lower limit to the upper limit in one go. The analyst further remarked that there is the potential for that to happen again this time. His accompanying suggested that this parabolic rally could happen before this year ends. Why A Rally To $0.75 Is Possible Crypto analyst Bitcoinsensus raised the possibility of a Dogecoin price rally to $0.75 and explained why DOGE could rally 450% to this resistance level. The analyst noted that each previous accumulation phase has led to a strong upswing in price. As such, Bitcoinsensus said that this might indicate what could happen next for the meme coin, with a potential rally to a new ATH.

He further remarked that the next thing needed is a weekly close above this level, and then DOGE could be “back in business.” The analyst had previously stated a reclaim of this level would be a huge positive, with his accompanying chart suggesting that this could put a potential rally to $0.4 on the cards. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.14, up over 11% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "Why The Ethereum Price Could Bounce Above $3,500 Soon",
    "body": "A crypto analyst has predicted that the Ethereum price could balloon to $3,500 soon, potentially breaking free of the bearish pressure that has suppressed its momentum for much of 2025. Although ETH is currently trading more than 37.5% below its all-time highs, the analyst has outlined technical indicators and market structure signals suggesting $3,500 is a realistic short-term target for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Crypto ETFs Defy The Pullback With $32 Billion In Fresh Investor Cash Ethereum Price Setup Points To $3,500 Rebound Crypto market analyst Tryrex has delivered a fresh outlook on the Ethereum price, pointing to conditions that could support a strong upside move to $3,500 in the coming months. In his post on X, the expert suggested that ETH may be approaching the end of its prolonged corrective phase and may be preparing for a decisive bounce. Tryrex highlighted the possibility of a strong rebound developing in the first quarter of 2026, driven by Ethereum’s current hold of a critical liquidity zone between $2,800 and $3,000. He explained that while Bitcoin (BTC) bottomed out in 2025 and entered a range-bound period right after, Ethereum showed relative strength by firmly defending the liquidity region. Based on the analyst’s weekly TradingView chart, this price area also represents a weekly demand zone that has absorbed repeated selling pressure. The fact that the price continues to hold this area indicates that market participants are buying ETH rather than distributing it. Volume behavior at the bottom of the chart also suggests that selling pressure has been weakening compared to earlier phases of Ethereum’s downtrend. Tryrex expects an impulsive move to emerge as Ethereum continues to react to the $2,800 to $3,000 liquidity range. If momentum builds as anticipated, ETH could break out of its current structure and push toward higher resistance levels, with a move above $3,500 seen as an increasingly likely near-term target. With its price currently sitting above $3,000, this would represent a more than 13% increase. The analyst has also revealed that his bullish forecast for ETH reflects broader conditions across the altcoin market. He highlighted that many major altcoins appear to be bottoming out after extended downtrends, increasing the possibility of coordinated upside moves if market sentiment and volatility improve. Ethereum Shows Early Moves In 2026 The market is just three days into 2026, and although major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin closed 2025 in the red, Ethereum appears to be showing early signs of recovery. Initially, the ETH started the year in a similar downtrend, but over the past 24 hours, its price has increased by approximately 2.5%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Altcoins Post Another Losing Year: Analyst CoinMarketCap data shows that from January 1 to date, Ethereum has declined by more than 9.5%. However, its trading volume in the last 24 hours has increased by over 100%, signaling strong trader interest despite the recent price dips. In addition, whales have been steadily accumulating ETH, taking advantage of lower prices to increase their positions. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Binance ETH Open Interest Surges Above $7.1B Amid Heavy Market Repositioning – Details",
    "body": "Amid the cheers of the new year, Ethereum achieved a decisive breakout above the long-standing price resistance around $3,000. According to market analyst Amr Taha, this price gain has been accompanied by significant changes in the derivatives market, which suggest an aggressive shift in investors’ positioning. Related Reading: 2026 Crypto Market Prediction: Will Prices Soar Or Face Continued Declines? Ethereum Traders Flood Market With Long Positions To Usher In 2026 In a QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, Amr Taha shares an in-depth analysis of the Binance derivatives market following ETH’s recent surge in the first days of 2026. Notably, the market expert reports an impulsive rise in ETH open interest on the world’s largest exchange, in what they described as “one of the strongest single-day increases seen recently. As the spot price climbed above $3,100, data from CryptoQuant shows that ETH open interest rose from approximately $6.2 billion to around $7.1 billion, representing a 12% increase in the last day. Taha highlights the importance of the coincidence, stating a rise in open interest amid price appreciation suggested that traders were opening fresh positions, rather than the move being driven solely by short covering. Interestingly, more data showed the ETH Cumulative Volume Delta – which measures the net difference between buying and selling volume over time – also rose alongside open interest, implying several positive developments. One of which is that long positions comprised the majority of the newly opened positions in the market, citing a heavy bullish sentiment around Ethereum. In addition, ETH buyers demonstrated heightened urgency by favoring market orders over passive limit bids, indicating aggressive taker-side demand, implying a strong market conviction that preferred to engage the market immediately rather than wait for lower prices. Related Reading: Popular Crypto Founder Dumps Millions In Ethereum, Here’s What He’s Buying A Potential Bull Trap? In analyzing the liquidation heatmap for the ETH derivative market, Amr Taha unveiled other critical price developments. Notably, ETH’s recent surge was partly driven by a short-squeeze effect around the $3,100 price level. Notably, when the altcoin touched this level, over-leveraged short traders had to defend their positions, effectively creating a market demand that translated into a sudden price gain. While the recent price increase and open interest boost represent positive moments for the market, Taha warns that forced liquidation often results in temporary resistance zones on the lower timeframe, especially when accompanied by rising funding rates. The analyst also explains that Ethereum’s price move appears leverage-driven and highly sentimental rather than structural, suggesting equal room for both opportunity and risk. At press time, the prominent altcoin trades at $3,087, representing a 2.51% gain in the last day. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",

    "body": "Recent on-chain data revealed a major shift in Ethereum net flow to the Binance exchange during December 2024. This eye-catching event could imply several market developments, especially following the asset’s bearish struggles in Q4 2025. Meanwhile, Ethereum has notably opened 2026 on a positive note, climbing to above $3,100 for the first time since mid-December. Related Reading: Ethereum Finds Its Footing Again, But Here’s Why Bulls Still Have Work To Do Ethereum Sees $960M Inflows As Investor Sentiment Shifts In a QuickTake post on December 3, the analysis page CryptoOnChain reports an important change in Ethereum investors’ activity. Notably, the Ethereum net inflow in December reached $960 million on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. The development is particularly important and compelling because it represents an impressive shift from the negative inflow record that had existed since July 2025. For the majority of H2 2025, investors had chosen to continually withdraw more ETH than deposit, likely in favour of long-term accumulation, i.e., bullish, or to divert potential selling pressure elsewhere. However, the figures recorded in December suggest an abrupt change in investors’ behavior, which bears multiple possible implications for the market. Generally, increased exchange inflows are considered a bearish signal interpreted as market participants’ preparation for a potential asset offload. Considering ETH price struggles in Q4 2025, this recent spike in net inflows could be indicative of a potential repositioning for an anticipated long-term bear market. However, CryptoOnChain highlights some possible positive effects of this event. The huge inflows recorded in December could also reflect a revival in buyer interest, suggesting renewed demand for Ethereum as investors prepare to accumulate at lower price levels. In addition, the heavy net inflows could also represent a new capital injection in the Ethereum market that has been moved to exchanges for active trading. In line with this thought, CryptoOnChain also states that traders may be moving capital to exchanges to capitalize on trading opportunities driven by an expected high volatility. In conclusion, the analysts emphasize that the sudden reversal leading to the massive inflows in December is a vital market signal potentially indicating a new phase of accumulation or heightened trading activity.

    "title": "A Maduro Bet, A Market Alarm: US Lawmaker Targets Trading Abuses",
    "body": "US Rep. Ritchie Torres said he will introduce legislation to curb what he and other lawmakers describe as possible insider trading on prediction markets, after a single, highly timed wager on Polymarket paid off when Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was captured. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Altcoins Post Another Losing Year: Analyst Reports have disclosed that the bill — being called the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026 — would bar federally elected officials, political appointees and executive branch staff from trading on event markets when they hold material nonpublic information. Public Integrity In Focus According to reporting, a newly created Polymarket account placed roughly $32,500 in bets on a contract that asked whether Maduro would be out of power by January 31, 2026. That stake bought about 438,000 shares when the market price was as low as $0.07 per share late Friday. Within about 24 hours, after action by US forces and an announcement by US President Donald Trump, the position surged—returning more than $400,000 to the account. NEW — RITCHIE TORRES (D-N.Y.) will introduce a bill on this. Bill will be called the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026 Description, per a source: This bill prohibits federal elected officials, political appointees, and Executive Branch employees… https://t.co/eZZ9BmAMgJ — Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) January 3, 2026 The trade’s timing set off immediate questions. Social media users and some investors flagged the purchase as suspicious because it came hours before the public announcement. Observers noted that prediction markets can move quickly on small flows of information, and that enforcement rules vary across platforms. Reports note that other markets, like Kalshi, had priced similar outcomes at roughly $0.13, underlining how unexpected the outcome was to many traders. A newly created Polymarket account invested over $30,000 yesterday in Maduro’s exit. The US then took Maduro into custody overnight, and the trader profited $400,000 in less than 24 hours. Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged. https://t.co/EtZyW1IWTa pic.twitter.com/MzsU9kOU73 — Joe Pompliano (@JoePompliano) January 3, 2026 How The Bill Would Work Torres’s proposal would adapt principles from existing rules that limit trading by officials in traditional securities markets and extend them to online prediction exchanges. The draft language aims to make it unlawful for covered government figures to trade on contracts tied to government actions or political events when they possess nonpublic information because of their official roles. The measure would also task regulators with clarifying which platforms are covered and how violations would be enforced. Market Reaction And Questions Platform operators have long said their terms forbid trading on material nonpublic information, but critics say those rules are hard to police in real time. Some analysts and lawmakers argue that this episode shows a gap between written policies and effective oversight. Others warn against overreach that could stifle legitimate market activity used for forecasting and research.

Lawmakers, meanwhile, are pushing for clearer legal guardrails. If Congress moves quickly, new rules could reshape who may legally bet on political and national security events.

    "title": "Bitcoin Price To Reclaim $100K In Imminent 15% Move — Here’s How",
    "body": "The Bitcoin price had more of a mixed performance than an outright negative showing in 2025. The market leader made a play for a new all-time high above $100,000 as early as January, but struggled to keep its six-figure valuation as the year wound down. The Bitcoin price has started the new year in a similar fashion to 2025, making its way above the $90,000 mark. However, the market uncertainty is at a record high, with no one knowing what to expect from the digital asset market in 2026. BTC Price Consolidating In Symmetrical Triangle — What Next? In a January 3 post on the social media platform X, market analyst Ali Martinez painted a bullish picture for the Bitcoin price. The crypto pundit postulated that the world’s largest cryptocurrency could be gearing up for an upward 15% price move in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Rally To All-Time Highs If It Breaks This Resistance Level The rationale behind this optimistic prediction is the appearance of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour timeframe of the Bitcoin price chart. The symmetrical triangle is a technical analysis pattern characterized by a diagonal falling upper trendline (connecting the swing highs) and a diagonally rising lower trendline (along the swing lows). In this symmetrical triangle chart formation, the asset price (BTC, in this case) typically contracts and moves toward the apex. The Bitcoin price eventually breaches either the upper trendline for a breakout or crosses the lower boundary, forming a breakdown. Hence, the symmetrical triangle pattern could provide a continuation or reversal signal depending on the direction of the break. It is worth mentioning that symmetrical triangles tend to be continuation break patterns, meaning the price tends to break in the initial trend direction before entering into the triangle pattern. If this theory holds in the current scenario, the Bitcoin price is likely to continue its upward movement after breaking the upper trendline here. The critical resistance in the upper trendline lies around the $91,000 region, and the flagship cryptocurrency needs a sustained close of at least two candlesticks above this level to confirm a bullish breakout. The price target is determined by adding the length of the widest point of the triangle (or base) to the breakout point. Based on this calculation, Martinez put forward a target above $102,000 for the Bitcoin price, representing a 15% surge from the current price point. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands around $91,560, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past 24 hours.
