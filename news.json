    "title": "Bernstein Forecasts Coinbase (COIN) To Surge 90%, Setting $510 Price Target",
    "body": "Coinbase (COIN), the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, has experienced a significant decline in its stock valuation, dropping nearly 40% from its peak of $444 in July to its current trading level of around $271 per share. This, amid market fluctuations and heightened volatility in the broader crypto market, impacting the exchange’s stock performance. Bernstein Forecasts New Bullish Phase For Coinbase Despite these challenges, analysts at Bernstein hold an optimistic outlook on Coinbase’s stock price, suggesting a potential new bullish phase that could propel COIN to surpass previous all-time highs and reach levels above $500. Bernstein maintains a price target of $510 on Coinbase, underlining the exchange’s shift from a trading-centric platform to what analysts dub an emerging “everything exchange.” Related Reading: XRP Price Predictions: AI Forecasts $4.40 By March 2026, Analysts Target Up To $6 Analysts led by Gautam Chhugani highlighted the delicate market conditions, citing crypto price fluctuations influencing listed crypto-exposed equities. However, Bernstein distinguishes the current market environment from past crypto downturns, noting that speculative excess primarily affects what they refer to as “MSTR copycats,” referencing Strategy’s (previously MicroStrategy) stock performance. Central to Bernstein’s bullish thesis is Coinbase’s strategic diversification away from volatile spot trading revenue. They assert that exchange is evolving into a comprehensive financial platform. The analysts emphasize that clearer regulatory guidelines in the US could drive a revaluation of these business lines, bridging the gap with offshore competitors benefiting from faster token listings and fundraising fees. Coinbase’s foray into token issuance through a launchpad-style model, exemplified by Monad’s (MON) recent listing, demonstrates growing market interest. Bernstein notes that these launches, directly influencing trading activity, can stimulate a cycle of issuance, listing, and heightened trading volume. Confident Ratings For COIN Looking ahead, one of the exchange’s most notable catalysts is the upcoming product showcase on December 17, anticipated to unveil developments in tokenized equities, prediction markets, and other tools expanding the exchange’s offerings beyond spot crypto trading. The integration with Deribit is also expected to further bolster Coinbase’s derivatives expansion, positioning the exchange closer to platforms like Robinhood as both entities diversify their product offerings.

Top Analyst Assigns 91.5% Probability On the consumer front, the exchange’s Base app, focusing on wallet services, payments, and social features, acts as a centralized access point for the broader token markets, reaffirming the analysts’ bullish predictions. Bernstein’s reaffirmed “Buy” rating on Coinbase with a massive $510 price target underscores the firm’s confidence in COIN’s growth trajectory. Monness Crespi’s recent upgrade from “Neutral” to “Buy” with a $375 target further adds to the bullish sentiment surrounding the stock’s valuation amid falling prices.

    "title": "Italy’s Market Watchdog Gives Crypto Firms A Clear Order: Act Or Exit",
    "body": "According to a press release from Consob on December 4, 2025, Italy’s securities regulator told crypto and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) that they must secure authorization under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regime (MiCA) by December 30, 2025, or stop serving Italian clients. Related Reading: A New Era Begins: CFTC Approves Spot Bitcoin On Regulated US Markets The notice warns operators that those who do not file for a MiCA-compliant license must close out services and return customer funds by the year-end. Consob’s Deadline And What It Means For Firms Based on reports, companies that submit an authorization application by the cutoff may keep operating while the application is under review. But that temporary permission will not last beyond June 30, 2026, regulators say. That window gives providers some breathing room, but it also sets a hard date for final approvals. Source: Consob The regulator singled out platforms that until now have worked under Italy’s lighter national registry system (OAM). Those businesses now face a choice: apply to become fully authorized crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) under MiCA or plan an orderly exit. Operators who plan to leave must notify users clearly and return assets in a safe, verifiable way. Italy Opens A Broader Risk Review According to a Reuters report, Italy’s Economy Ministry has also ordered an in-depth review of crypto risks, bringing together the Bank of Italy, Consob and other agencies to check whether current protections are strong enough for investors and the wider financial system. The move came during a committee meeting that flagged rising exposure and the need to monitor spillovers into traditional finance. What Investors Should Watch For Next Customers in Italy should confirm whether their chosen platform has lodged a MiCA application or has made clear plans for compliance or exit. If an operator fails to apply by December 30, users could face service interruptions and will need to follow the provider’s instructions for fund returns. Regulators say transparency from firms will be key in the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Is Just Getting Started — 200x Growth Possible, Tom Lee Says Smaller local platforms may find the compliance burden steep. Some operators could seek licenses in other EU states and use passporting rules to serve Italian clients, while others may shut down or merge. The provisional operating window stretches into mid-2026, but the final shape of the market will depend on how quickly firms meet the tougher requirements and how long authorizations take to process. Consob’s notice is meant to cut through uncertainty and force a choice before year-end. The combination of a firm deadline, mandatory filings and a parallel review marks a stricter approach to crypto oversight in Italy. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Price Falls Below $90,000 — Is The Recovery Over?",
    "body": "The Bitcoin price has had a mixed performance over the past week, with both sides of the market divide struggling to establish dominance. In the latest battle between the bulls and bears, the premier cryptocurrency appears to be succumbing to pressure from the latter group. As this weekend approached, the Bitcoin price retreated from its latest local high of around $94,000 to beneath the psychological $90,000 level. This latest correction has prompted questions in the crowd, with investors wondering whether it is just a brief obstacle or the end of the recovery. Why $80,500 Could Be The Next Local Low For BTC In a December 5 post on the social media platform X, Alphractal CEO and founder shared insight into the latest Bitcoin price decline below $90,000. The on-chain expert revealed that losing the $89,800 level is the more relevant occurrence in the latest price downturn. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Faces Potential 60% Decline As Expert Warns Of ‘Major Bull Trap’ In a previous post on X, Wedson evaluated the likely trajectory of the Bitcoin price should it lose the $89,800 level. The crypto pundit revealed that losing this price mark could lead to an accumulation pattern for the bulls or a redistribution phase for the bears. While the accumulation period for the bulls would initially coincide with lower prices, it eventually leads to a Bitcoin price return to above the latest local high. Meanwhile, a redistribution phase could see the bears push the flagship cryptocurrency to around the $70,000 mark. According to the Alphractal CEO, the price of BTC also failed to hold the key on-chain levels, strengthening the probability of a broader price sideways phase. “Sideways action is the cause — the big pumps or dumps are just the effect,” Wedson had earlier stated in his previous X post. Furthermore, Wedson noted that the next level to watch is $86,500, which, if lost, opens the very high possibility for the formation of a new local low around $80,500. This local low could provide a perfect spot for investors to buy the dip and enter the market. Bitcoin Price Overview As mentioned earlier, the past week has been one of highs and lows for the premier cryptocurrency, plummeting to as low as $84,600 on Monday, December 1. After a shaky start to the month, the Bitcoin price recovered strongly to around $94,000 on Thursday, December 4. As of this writing, the market leader is valued at around $89,415, reflecting an over 3% price decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of Bitcoin has been down by nearly 10% in the past year.

    "body": "Industry leader Tom Lee has shared how the Ethereum price could reach $12,000 within the next few months. He based his prediction on the Bitcoin price action and how ETH could match the flagship crypto on a potential run to the upside. Tom Lee Explains How The Ethereum Price Could Rally To $12,000 Speaking at the Binance Blockchain Week, Tom Lee predicted that the Ethereum price could reach $12,000 as Bitcoin rallies to $250,000 within the next few months. He explained that ETH can reach the $12,000 target if the ETH/BTC ratio returns to its eight-year average of 0.0479. Lee described this potential rally to $12,000 as a “huge move.” Related Reading: Ethereum Price To Recover Or Crash? The Real ‘Leverage Point’ Investors Should Know About Tom Lee further predicted that the Ethereum price could reach $22,000 if the ETH/BTC ratio gets to its 2021 high of 0.0873. He added that he believes Ethereum will become the future of finance and the payment rails. As such, Lee predicted that the ETH/BTC ratio could reach 0.2500, sparking an Ethereum rally to as high as $62,500. In line with this, the expert declared that ETH at $3,000 is “grossly undervalued.” Tom Lee also remarked that the bigger the base, the bigger the breakout for the Ethereum price. He noted that ETH spent years building a similar base to its current price action before the move from $90 to its previous all-time high (ATH) of $4,866. The expert added that if the pattern plays out again, the next leg could be larger than what people expect. It is worth noting that Tom Lee is the chairman of BitMine, which is the largest Ethereum treasury company. According to Strategic ETH Reserve data, the company currently holds 3.73 million ETH, which is just over 3% of the altcoin’s total supply. Lee remains bullish on the Ethereum price, despite his company holding an unrealized loss of $3.3 billion of their ETH investment. A Rally To $62,000 Is “Ambitious” Market commentator Milk Road described Tom Lee’s Ethereum price prediction of $62,000 in a few months as being ambitious. The platform stated that an ETH/BTC ratio of 0.25 has never happened. The highest it has ever gone is 0.15, and that was during the 2017 supercycle, which makes it less likely now, given that market conditions have changed. Related Reading: When Will Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Go Into A Bear Market? Tom Lee had based his Ethereum prediction on Bitcoin hitting $250,000, which Milk Road also described as an issue. The market commentator noted that BTC would need to surge 177% from current prices to reach this target. The last time this happened was in 2020 when it surged from $7,000 to $19,000 during the “peak mania.” Notably, BTC didn’t record a 100% gain even when the Bitcoin ETFs launched last year. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,000, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "Massive Bitcoin Awakening: 2 Physical Coins Unlock $179 Million After 13 Years",
    "body": "Two long-dormant Casascius coins, each loaded with 1,000 Bitcoin, were activated on Friday, unlocking more than $179 million that had sat untouched for over 13 years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Is Just Getting Started — 200x Growth Possible, Tom Lee Says According to onchain data, one of the coins was minted in October 2012 when Bitcoin traded at $11.69. The other dates back to December 2011, when BTC was worth $3.88, giving that piece a theoretical gain near 2.3 million% since minting. Historic Physical Coins Activated Based on reports, Casascius coins (metal coins) were produced between 2011 and 2013 by Utah entrepreneur Mike Caldwell as physical representations of Bitcoin. Each coin or bar concealed a paper with a private key, and a tamper-resistant hologram covered that key. 🚨🚨🚨 Two Casascius coins, each containing 1,000 BTC, have just moved after being dormant for more than 13 years. pic.twitter.com/nlFUy39MkD — Sani | TimechainIndex.com (@SaniExp) December 5, 2025 Records show only 16 of the 1,000 BTC bars and 6 of the 1,000 BTC coins were ever made, making these items both rare and historically important. Caldwell shut down the operation after receiving a letter from FinCEN that raised questions about whether his business qualified as an unlicensed money transmitter. How The Coins Worked The mechanism was simple in practice but strict in outcome: whoever removed the hologram and revealed the private key could claim the full Bitcoin value stored beneath it. Once that sticker was lifted and the private key used, the coin no longer carried any Bitcoin value. Based on reports, collectors treat that moment as irreversible. Some owners chose to move funds off the physical coins without cashing out. Rarity And Returns Numbers here show why collectors and investors watch these events closely. Two coins at 1,000 BTC each represent a huge hoard when prices are high. Even leaving aside the cost of minting, the December 2011 coin’s rise from $3.88 to current market valuations yields a headline-grabbing multiple. But experts warn that turning the private key into spendable Bitcoin is only the first step; what happens next depends on the holder’s choices. Some will hold. Others may move funds into cold storage. Selling is not guaranteed.

Based on CoinGlass data, today’s derivatives activity showed an 11,588% liquidation imbalance that overwhelmingly wiped out long positions. Bitcoin, at the time of writing, was trading below $90,000, and more than $20 million in BTC long liquidations occurred in minutes while short positions barely budged. That kind of one-sided pressure happens when many traders are crowded in the same direction and conditions change quickly. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Analyst Points To $82,000 As Most Crucial Bitcoin Price Level — Here’s Why",
    "body": "In a not-so-surprising turn of events, the bearish orientation of the Bitcoin price has continued into the month of December, suggesting that the premier cryptocurrency could end the year in the red. Interestingly, recent on-chain data has offered insights into the likely direction of Bitcoin based on the integrity of an important price level. Active Market Participants’ Cost Basis At $82,000 In a December 5 post on the X platform, market analyst Burak Kesmeci shared an interesting outlook on the direction of the Bitcoin price. The analyst disclosed that whatever happens around the $82,000 mark could make or mar Bitcoin’s trajectory in the near term. To demonstrate why this price region is so important, Kesmeci pointed out that it appears to be the convergence point of two highly influential cost bases in Bitcoin’s history. Related Reading: Bitcoin Signals Bear Market: One Thing Could Flip It, Says CryptoQuant CEO Kesmeci revealed that the Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds have an average purchase cost of approximately $82,000. Because ETFs are one of Bitcoin’s strongest demand sources, tracking the values of their average cost-basis could serve as a good means to tell where the market stands institutionally. The crypto pundit also referenced the Bitcoin True Market Mean metric, which monitors the cost at which active investors procured their holdings—except for mined or rarely-moved BTC. Notably, in the current market cycle, Bitcoin’s active participants mostly purchased their coins around a valuation of $82,000. What Happens If $82,000 Fails? Usually, when price slips beneath any major price support, there is, in turn, an increase in overall selling pressure, as buy-side liquidity is converted to bearish momentum via losses incurred by investors. Hence, in the scenario where $82,000 fails to hold, a wave of bearish pressure is expected to ensue, as Bitcoin’s active investors try to cut their losses. However, Kesmeci expects something even more specific to follow. According to historical data, whenever Bitcoin falls beneath its active market participant cost basis, it often falls further downwards, as though it is targeting its Realized Price. Related Reading: The $13.5 Billion Liquidity Injection That Could Send Bitcoin And Crypto Prices Flying At the moment, the Bitcoin Realized Price sits near $56,000 — a price level significantly beneath its investors’ average cost basis. Kesmeci therefore warned that a slip beneath $82,000 could precede Bitcoin’s sharp downturn towards $56,000. This would represent an almost 40% decline from the current price point. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $89,310, reflecting an over 3% dip in the past 24 hours. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Is Ready To Fly, Here’s Why",
    "body": "Dogecoin has been bleeding lower in recent days, grinding back toward the mid-$0.13 band. Sellers have been in control of most candles in the past 24 hours, and each attempt at a rebound has faded quickly, leaving Dogecoin stuck near the bottom of a range. One crypto analyst on X has focused attention on an important technical level on the 2-day chart. Even though price action looks weak, Dogecoin is now sitting right on a long-term support zone inside a descending triangle pattern, and this area could become the launchpad for a strong upside move if buyers react from here. The chart shared with the analysis highlights exactly where Dogecoin is resting and why this region matters. Dogecoin Sitting On Major Descending Triangle Technical analysis of Dogecoin’s price action on the 2-day candlestick timeframe chart shows the meme coin has been trading in a clear descending triangle since December 2024. A downward-sloping trendline has capped every rally this year, leading to the creation of a series of lower highs that reflect persistent selling pressure throughout the year. At the same time, a horizontal support zone underneath in the mid-$0.135 to $0.14 region has caught multiple drops and prevented a deeper breakdown. Related Reading: Top Dogecoin Wallets Begin Rapid Accumulation As Price Struggles, Is A Surge Coming? Right now, Dogecoin is pressing that lower border again. The candles on the 2-day chart cluster just above the dashed support band, and the analyst, who goes by Butterfly on X, circled this cluster in green to show how closely the price is hugging the level. Each prior visit to this zone has produced at least a temporary bounce, which is why the current test is notable. The price action is tightening, and there is less room left for sideways movement before a decisive break happens. Dogecoin Is “Ready To Fly” In the post on X, the analyst notes that this support has been “respected multiple times” and that bulls are “getting ready to step in.” The most important thing is for the lower support to hold again, and the descending triangle may flip from a slow grind lower into a springboard for a strong reaction. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Can Stage A 96% Rally If It Breaks This Falling Wedge Pattern A firm defense of this zone would mean that sellers are running out of momentum at these prices. From there, even a modest wave of buying could drive Dogecoin back toward the descending resistance line that cuts across the chart from the $0.25 to $0.26 area. A break and close above that trendline would mark the first clean higher high in months and would confirm that the triangle has resolved to the upside. The analyst’s green arrow on the chart sketches out this potential path. The path shows Dogecoin lifting from the current support band, breaking above resistance, and reaching as high as $0.4 in one swift move. Featured image from Pngtree, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Ethereum Shows Strength: Indicators Suggest Bigger Moves Ahead",
    "body": "Ethereum is gaining momentum, and several technical signals suggest that a significant move could be on the way. With key support levels holding and bullish patterns forming, the market may be setting up for a notable upside. Golden Pocket Rejection: Confirming The High-Risk Scenario In a recent update on X, analyst Luca referenced his recent market commentary, noting that Ethereum price action unfolded exactly as he had anticipated, with the price tapping into the lost high-timeframe support range. This range aligned with the golden pocket between the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels, and the price rejected there, confirming the high-risk scenario he had highlighted in advance. Related Reading: Ethereum Coils For A Breakout As IH&S + Heavy Accumulation Emerges Since that rejection, the price has broken below the key 0.618 Fibonacci Point of Interest (POI). However, the asset is still managing to hold above the crucial 1-Day Bull Market Support Band. Luca stressed that this band has historically served as a strong reversal spot over the last couple of months. Thus, he believes the current low-timeframe market structure is not yet fully invalidated. Despite this technical hold, the analyst reiterated his cautious approach, stating that until he sees clear signs of strength on the low-timeframes, signs that can durably confirm the bottom is in and that key support levels are properly reclaimed, he won’t scale out of his edges. Luca concluded that until that concrete bullish confirmation materializes, the most likely outcome for the immediate future remains further consolidation. The market needs time to absorb the recent volatility and build a new base before a more durable reversal to the upside can take hold. ETH/BTC Trendline Breakout: Market Risk Appetite Returns Crypto analyst Paramatik outlined that a major structural event has occurred on the ETH/BTC charts: a falling trend breakout. This is a highly significant development, although Paramatik suggests that a retest of this broken trendline may occur before the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Sitting On Its Most Critical On-Chain Support Level — A Rally Emerging? The analyst provided clarity on what this breakout means for the broader market. First and foremost, this situation is interpreted as a strengthening signal for Ethereum. When ETH begins to gain value relative to Bitcoin, it typically indicates that the market’s overall risk appetite is returning, as investors shift capital from BTC to ETH. Secondly, the gained strength in Ethereum is often the key trigger for the start of the much-anticipated altcoin season. This is because investors first shift funds from BTC to ETH, and then move capital into the riskier, smaller altcoins in hopes of achieving higher returns. Paramatik summarized his findings by stating that this breakout in the ETH/BTC pair is not merely a technical line break; it is a harbinger of a market direction change. The analyst concluded with an analogy that the market has reached a state where every external event, even humorously irrelevant ones, could affect crypto prices.

    "title": "Forget Bitcoin, The Uber-Wealthy Are Now Rapidly Buying XRP: CEO",
    "body": "Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group, says ultra-wealthy families are rapidly accumulating XRP, and he believes most XRP holders still don’t realize how rare their position is. In a video posted on X, Claver revealed that his firm has been in recent conversations with large family offices that are now making significant allocations into XRP. His comments arrive at a moment when XRP’s long-term narrative is witnessing increased interest due to ETFs, and they highlight a shift happening among investors who have always avoided cryptocurrencies altogether. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Is Just Getting Started — 200x Growth Possible, Tom Lee Says Wealthy Families Quietly Accumulating XRP Claver explained that XRP ownership is currently extremely limited relative to the global population, noting that only around 8 million wallets exist on the XRPL. Half of those wallets contain fewer than 100 XRP, which makes existing holders far more uncommon than they may think. He contrasted this with Bitcoin’s widespread ownership, arguing that XRP is still early in its adoption curve. He said the wealthy families showing interest are not looking for quick profits. According to him, they have already built their fortunes and instead see XRP as a form of insurance. According to his post, these families are buying crypto, not to get richer, but to protect the wealth they already have. He described their interest in cryptocurrencies as a hedge. These investors want something uncorrelated in their portfolios ahead of any potential shock in traditional markets. Claver’s $10K Price Target And The Conditions He Outlined When asked where he sees the price of XRP going, Claver stated that he believes the cryptocurrency could be trading at $10,000 by late 2026 or early 2027. He tied this prediction to how much ecosystem infrastructure becomes active on the XRPL over the next two years. He said the network would need substantial institutional-grade utilities, including XRP treasury systems, Evernorth’s launch, on-chain borrowing mechanisms, and new amendments to the XRP Ledger that will bring in additional compliance layers and smart-contract features. His projection assumes that rising network volume will require higher liquidity levels and that price stability at four- and five-figure ranges will only be achievable if the ledger is handling large-scale financial flows. He also pointed to ETFs as a major factor in shaping supply and demand, noting that as ETF adoption grows, more XRP will be locked away in long-term institutional products. Speaking of ETFs, Spot XRP ETFs are now approaching $1 billion in total net assets and could cross that threshold within the next few days. Since their debut, these funds have taken in about $897.35 million worth of XRP from exchanges and OTC desks, and they have yet to record a single day of outflows.

He explained that Ripple is seeing notable activity through Ripple Prime, where long-watching institutions that once stayed out due to regulatory uncertainty or simple risk aversion are finally beginning to step in.
