    "title": "Bitcoin Slips Below This Key Zone — Is A Final Flush Coming?",
    "body": "Bitcoin has once again fallen below a critical support zone, raising questions about whether the market is gearing up for a deeper sell-off. With selling pressure still intact, traders are now watching key levels closely to see if a final flush toward lower support is imminent. Price Faces Another Rejection MakroVision Research shared on X that Bitcoin has once again met strong rejection, resulting in a decisive break below several key support levels. Price has now slipped back into the range of the previous low and continues to trade beneath the critical green resistance zone between $85,200 and $86,200, highlighting that bearish pressure remains in control for now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Begins To Rise, Raising Early Bear Market Concerns On the very short-term timeframe, there are early signs of an attempted rebound, but without a timely and sustainable reclaim of the $85,200–$86,200 zone, this move is best viewed as a technical counter-bounce rather than the start of a meaningful trend reversal. As long as the price remains capped below this area, the broader short-term downtrend remains intact. From a tactical perspective, the $85,200–$86,200 region has become the key battlefield. A clean reclaim and hold above this zone would be the first clear indication that selling pressure is beginning to fade, potentially allowing for price stabilization and a relief rally. If this reclaim attempt fails, the risk of continued downside acceleration increases. In that case, focus would turn to the $72,300–$75,300 range, a technically prominent support zone with historical significance. This zone may ultimately serve as a potential support and reversal region should the market experience another phase of capitulation. CME Gap Opens: What To Expect From Bitcoin This Weekend Crypto analyst MartyParty, in a recent Bitcoin Wyckoff Accumulation update, highlighted that a CME gap is opening, which is expected to be filled by Sunday evening. This sets the stage for potential short-term volatility, with traders closely watching key technical levels and liquidation activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Backs Off Resistance — Breakdown Or Brief Pause? Several scenarios are possible over the coming days. One possibility is the continued liquidation of remaining leveraged longs, with the lowest 25x Binance liquidation currently around $79,350, potentially completing the classic Wyckoff Spring pattern. Another scenario is a retest of secondary support at $81,800, which could act as a temporary floor for Bitcoin’s price action. If support at $81,800 holds, Bitcoin may trade sideways or attempt to push toward the primary support level, which has now turned into resistance at $84,800. The most probable scenario suggests a move up through $84,500 toward $86,463, followed by a retest of $84,500 on Sunday night as the CME gap is filled, completing the near-term Wyckoff accumulation setup.

    "title": "Why Shiba Inu Holders Should Look Forward To Sunday",
    "body": "Shiba Inu has spent recent weeks locked in a downward price action with bullish momentum fading and investor interest thinning without a clear bullish direction. However, holders may finally have something concrete to anticipate. Refreshing activity from Shytoshi Kusama, the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s lead developer, has diverted attention to a key moment expected on Sunday. Lead Dev Breaks Silence, Teases Sunday That dynamic began to change when Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous lead developer and co-founder of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, resurfaced on X after a prolonged absence since early December. However, Kusama broke his silence this week with a thread on X explaining the reasons behind his inactivity and has since returned to regular posting and reposting activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slide To $82K Sets Off A $1.7 Billion Chain Reaction One post stood out more than the rest, in which Kusama hinted at a revelation scheduled for Sunday. In that message, he spoke about arriving at a discovery by pure chance and referenced what he described as an ancient marker older than time itself. Although the message was a bit cryptic, it immediately generated attention across the SHIB community, which has been hungry for direction and clarity amid recent challenges in Shiba Inu’s price action. The significance of Sunday became clearer following an interesting exchange between Kusama and a Shiba Inu community member who openly expressed concerns about transparency, reassurance, and leadership presence after recent ecosystem issues. The community member, known as RuggRat on X, noted how there has been no official statement or simple explanation of what happened from Kusama regarding the Shibarium exploit. This is in reference to the September 2025 Shibarim Bridge exploit, which saw attackers making off with $4.1 million worth of crypto assets. In response, Kusama acknowledged the concern, stating that silence can sometimes be strategic and framing Sunday as a moment for addressing issues step by step. “This is what Sunday is for. One at a time,” Kusama said. Fair. But sometimes silence is a weapon for quiet wars. This is what Sunday is for. One bandage. Take off. Fix. Put on. One at a time. — Shytoshi Kusama™ (@ShytoshiKusama) January 29, 2026 Shiba Inu’s Challenging Phase Has Tested Holder Confidence Shiba Inu’s price action has struggled to gain any meaningful upside traction since the beginning of 2026, an extension of its late 2025 run. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading around $0.0000071, keeping it pinned down by 1.8% and 10.5% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. Price structure during this period has been marked by a series of lower lows, with persistent selling pressure leaving little room for a meaningful higher high to form.

    "title": "SUI At The Smart Money Zone: Big Moves Brewing Above $2",
    "body": "SUI is approaching a critical smart money zone, with price action signaling that big moves could be on the horizon. Sustained trading above $2 may trigger a breakout, setting the stage for the next significant leg higher. SUI Reaches Stage For Major Money Entry Crypto analyst Crypto Patel, in a recent post, highlighted that SUI is at the same stage where big money typically enters the market, urging traders not to miss this opportunity. According to the weekly chart, the long-term ascending channel remains intact, and price is currently trading near a sell-side liquidity grab close to trendline support, signaling potential accumulation. Related Reading: SUI Reclaims Key Support With Strength — Is $2.35 The Next Target? The chart also shows strong weekly demand and a bullish order block between $1.15 and $0.80, indicating that the market structure is poised to turn super bullish if SUI clears higher-timeframe resistance. The current compression phase is a classic setup for expansion, meaning the market is preparing for a potential breakout. Crypto Patel emphasized that smart money tends to buy during compression, while retail often enters after confirmation of the move. If the breakout confirms, projected targets for SUI are $5, $10, and $20, illustrating the potential scale of the next trend. As Crypto Patel puts it, “This is how big trends are built, slowly, then suddenly. Liquidity is cleared, demand is active, and patience gets rewarded.” Price Trading Around $1.28 Altcoinpedia outlined that SUI is currently trading around $1.28, which serves as the anchor for near-term market analysis. The price structure indicates ongoing consolidation above support near $1.50, while resistance is observed around $2.00. This setup reflects a tightening range as buyers and sellers balance, suggesting that a decisive move could be approaching. Related Reading: Sui Restores Service After Major 6-Hour Outage Shook Network Price oscillation within this range highlights that sustained volume expansion above $2.00 could drive the next leg of the trend toward $2.50. Conversely, failure to break this resistance, particularly with shrinking volume, increases the likelihood of a retest of support at $1.50. Should that level fail to hold, price could decline further toward $1.20. Momentum currently resides in a neutral state, reflecting indecision in the market. In a bullish scenario, a clean break above $2.00, confirmed by momentum indicators, would signal trend continuation. On the downside, a breach of support under heavy volume could accelerate selling pressure and confirm a bearish scenario. Traders are advised to use key range boundaries for entries and exits, managing risk around both support and resistance levels. For longer-term investors, it is prudent to wait for a decisive breakout from the current consolidation, which would provide a clearer signal for trend direction and reduce the risk of false moves within the neutral range.

    "title": "Here’s Why Bitcoin Fall Below $80,000 Could Be A Deep Pit – Analyst",
    "body": "In the past few hours, Bitcoin has dropped below $80,000 amid another wave of liquidations as January comes to a rather volatile close. Analysts at Kobeissi note there have been three notable liquidation events in the past 12 hours, resulting in a combined loss of $1.3 billion. Such developments, coupled with a very fearful market after last week’s price slump, have pushed Bitcoin below a key price level. According to the renowned market expert Burak Kesmeci, Bitcoin’s behavior towards this $80,000 price zone holds significant consequences for the market trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio Spikes To New High — Fresh Volatility Ahead? Bitcoin Slips Under ETF Realized Price As Downside Risk Grows In a recent X post, Burak Kesmeci outlines the technical and on-chain importance of the $80,000 price level to the Bitcoin market. Before Bitcoin’s recent breakdown below $80,000, the asset had twice retested this zone following the correction phase that began in early October 2025. Each successful rebound from these retests reinforced $80,000 as a critical support level, with certain chart formations even hinting at potential trend reversal. This underscored the market’s technical sensitivity to this level before the recent loss. However, Kesmeci highlights an on-chain importance of the $80,000 price point in that it also functions as the cost basis of the Bitcoin Spot ETFs. Therefore, the recent price fall below $80,000 places a large cohort of institutional investors at risk of entering unrealized losses. In January 2026 alone, the Bitcoin ETFs already witnessed massive levels of withdrawals, resulting in a total net outflow of $1.61 billion. However, these figures are likely to surge higher as sustained price decline below the ETF cost basis is expected to trigger a wide-scale, panic-driven redemption among investors. In addition to its on-chain and technical importance, Kesmeci also notes that $80,000 presently functions as the True Market Mean.

According to Burak Kesmeci, a bearish scenario would require a weekly close below the $80,000 support level. If confirmed, the analyst warns that bearish momentum could intensify, potentially driving Bitcoin lower toward $72,000, $68,000, and eventually $62,000 in sequence. This is because these levels align with notable volume profile clusters, representing potential areas where liquidity could accumulate, and the price may temporarily stabilize. Conversely, in a bullish scenario, Kesmeci notes that a sustained rebound from current levels could shift momentum back in favor of the bulls. The first major upside hurdle lies at $90,000, followed by the 111-period Simple Moving Average (SMA111) near $95,000, which is described as a critical level for confirming a medium-term trend reversal. A decisive break above the psychological $100,000 resistance would further strengthen the bullish case and signal a potential resumption of the broader uptrend. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $77,832, reflecting a 7.1% loss in the past day. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview",

    "title": "Bitcoin Air Pocket Presents Potential Fall To $73,000 – Details",
    "body": "Bitcoin bearish sentiments continue to dominate the market, after prices fell below the key $80,000 on January 31, resulting in a new wave of market liquidations. Interestingly, a pseudonymous analyst with the username CryptoMe has identified an “air pocket” in the present price structure, which potentially points to the downside target of this recent price drop. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adjusted SOPR Shows Market At Pivotal Junction — What’s Next? Bitcoin Now Below $80K Support Zone – What Next? In a QuickTake post on January 31, CryptoMe draws attention to an existing price vacuum between $73,000 – $80,000 as confirmed by three different market metrics. This observation is important in anticipating Bitcoin downside targets, considering the presently heightened market fears following the latest price decline. According to CryptoMe, liquidity levels on the Binance spot order book showed a concentration of limit buy orders between $73,000 – $80,000 that formed between late October and early November. Despite the price surge from $80,000 to around $100,000 seen in late Q4 2025, the liquidity cluster price zone remained untouched. Therefore, the zone is likely to act as a short-term price magnet should bearish momentum persist, as markets often gravitate toward areas of unfilled liquidity during periods of heightened volatility. Another on-chain metric that supports the existence of an air pocket between $73,000 – $80,000 is the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) price histogram. Each Bitcoin transaction consumes existing UTXOs and creates new ones; therefore, UTXOs are a good measure of on-chain transaction activity. As seen in the chart above, the sparse UTXO density between $73,000 and $80,000 suggests that a small number of transactions occurred within this price range. Thus, investors failed to establish a cost basis that would prevent further price decline, as prices have now slipped below $80,000. The final metric highlighted by CryptoMe is the Spot ETF Investor Average Cost, which currently stands at $79,000. Following the launch of the Bitcoin Spot ETFs in January 2024, Bitcoin has failed to trade below its realized price until now. Considering all three metrics, it’s likely that Bitcoin is headed for the $73,000 price mark, which the market has not visited since April 2025. Moreover, such a decline would represent a 40% devaluation from the present market all-time high.

    "title": "Bitcoin LTH Supply Rises Again Amid Bearish Market Dynamics",
    "body": "The Bitcoin market experienced a shockingly dramatic weekend, as opposed to the typical silent price action displayed in previous weekends. On Saturday, January 31st, the world’s leading cryptocurrency seemingly led other crypto assets south of the charts, with its price falling from $84,350 to as low as $75,000 in a single swoop. As this unfolded, an inversely correlated shift also played out underneath the charts. A recent on-chain evaluation has pointed out that Bitcoin’s Long-term Holder behavior is changing, contrary to what its short-term holders are doing. Long-Term Holders Accumulate As Short-Term Supply Declines Pseudonymous on-chain analyst Darkfost recently took to CryptoQuant, via a Quicktake post, pointing out that Bitcoin’s long-term holders are racking up more BTC. The relevant indicator here is the LTH supply change (Coinbase fix). Related Reading: Rising Above The Ashes: XRP ETFs Set New Record Despite Market Crash For context, this metric tracks the net change in the amount of Bitcoin held by long-term holders (typically coins unmoved for ~155 days). According to the analyst, approximately 186,000 (on a monthly average) have been added to the Long-term holders’ supply. Seeing as more coins are aging past 155 days, Darkfost implied that short-term holder supply is, in turn, witnessing steady contraction. Notably, the analyst pointed out this kind of transition (between long-term and short-term investors) last happened in April, as the Bitcoin price retraced. As it is intuitively evident, a rising LTH supply is typically interpreted as growing conviction among Bitcoin’s long-term investors. By extension, this means that long-term holders are distributing less of their holdings and stowing away more. In theory, this behavior is bullish news for the cryptocurrency. This is because, as LTHs absorb supply, the amount of available Bitcoin for sale reduces. Historically, it is also a bullish signal for the BTC price, as it has often appeared during the early stages of accumulation periods or late into correction stages. However, the broader market implications in the current context might not be so favorable. Darkfost highlighted that there is very weak demand available to cushion the falling BTC price. At the same time, the Bitcoin market appears to be entering a bearish phase; hence, it is not far-fetched to see major capitulation events in the near-term. If this happens, the Bitcoin price would likely plummet, as weaker investors may sell off their holdings in fear or as victims of liquidation events. For a bullish outlook to be truly relevant, there has to be a clear recovery in demand, alongside continued long-term holder accumulation. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of press time, the Bitcoin price stands at approximately $78,060, reflecting a 6.9% loss in the past day.

    "title": "Ethereum Price Slips Below $2,500 — Here Are The Next Support Levels",
    "body": "The Ethereum price has been under intense bearish pressure over the past few weeks, reflecting the overall fragile state of the cryptocurrency market. The altcoin lost nearly 20% of its value in the past week, free-falling under the psychological $3,000 level since Thursday, January 29th. With the market still showing signs of further downside risk, there is no telling how deep the Ethereum price will fall in the current bearish setup. However, the latest on-chain data has offered insights into the next critical levels for the second-largest cryptocurrency. ETH’s Next Support Stands At $2,475: Glassnode In a recent post on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified the next three on-chain support levels for the Ethereum price. This on-chain evaluation revolves around the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric, which helps to pinpoint strong resistance and support levels based on investor cost bases. Related Reading: Ripple’s David Schwartz Shuts Down Claims Of XRP Hitting $100 For context, an investor’s cost basis refers to the actual price at which they purchased a particular cryptocurrency (Ethereum, in this scenario). Typically, the ability of a price level to function as an on-chain support or resistance zone depends on the number of investors who have their cost basis at the given level. As inferred earlier, the UTXO Realized Price Distribution tracks the amount of a particular cryptocurrency that was acquired at a specific price level. Now, the price levels below the present spot value with significant trading activity are often considered as major support zones, as shown in the chart below. The reasoning behind this expectation is that investors with their cost bases around these price levels are likely to double down on their positions and purchase more coins. This increased buying activity will, hence, offer a cushion for the Ethereum price to stay afloat and potentially bounce back. Highlighting data from Glassnode, Martinez identified the $2,623, $2,475, and $1,881 levels as the next crucial support zones for the Ethereum price after losing the $2,772 mark. However, it appears that the altcoin’s price has also lost the $2,623 and $2,475 support following its latest decline over the weekend. Ethereum Price Overview As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,410, reflecting an over 10% decline in the past 24 hours. With this latest decline, the altcoin’s price seems to be hovering around the support cushion at around $2,475. If ETH’s stay below this support level is sustained, investors could see the Ethereum price fall to as low as $1,881. A fall of this magnitude would represent a 25% decline from the current price point and an over 60% correction from the cycle high.
