    "title": "Bitcoin Extreme Fear Streak Extends To 13 Days On Christmas",
    "body": "Data of the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index suggests the average investor sentiment has now been inside the extreme fear zone for 13 straight days. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Still Pointing At Extreme Fear The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment shared by traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. The index determines the sentiment by referring to the data of five factors: market cap dominance, trading volume, Google Trends, social sentiment, and volatility. It then represents it using a numeric scale that runs from zero to hundred. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trading Near ‘Fair Value,’ Says On-Chain Model All values above 53 indicate the presence of a greed sentiment among the investors, while those below 47 suggest the dominance of fear. Levels lying between the two thresholds correspond to a net neutral mentality. Besides these three core regions, there are also two “extreme” zones in the Fear & Greed Index, known as the extreme fear and extreme greed. The former occurs at and below 25, while the latter occurs above 75. Now, here is how the sentiment among investors in the current Bitcoin market is, according to the Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the majority sentiment in the cryptocurrency sector is one of extreme fear at the moment, with the indicator sitting at a value of 23. The despair among the investors isn’t new, as the index has, in fact, remained in this region for the last couple of weeks. As displayed in the chart, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has indicated extreme fear for 13 consecutive days now, underscoring the FUD that has been present in the market. If history is anything to go by, though, the extremely fearful sentiment may not actually be such a bad sign for BTC and other cryptocurrencies. Often, digital asset markets tend to move in a direction that goes contrary to the crowd’s belief. This probability of an opposite move generally becomes the strongest inside the extreme sentiment zones, with major tops and bottoms historically forming while the index has been in the respective region. The price low in November, which has acted as the bottom for Bitcoin so far, also occurred alongside an extended stay inside the extreme fear territory. Clearly, though, that extreme fear streak wasn’t enough to reignite sustained bullish momentum for BTC, as the asset has only consolidated since then. Related Reading: When Will Bitcoin Bottom? History Points To October 2026, Says Analyst As such, it only remains to be seen whether the latest stay inside extreme fear will be able to change that or if it will be a while before the bottom is reached in the current cycle. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $87,500, unchanged from one week ago. Featured image from Dall-E, Alternative.me, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Has Entered A Bear Market, And This Data Backs It Up",
    "body": "The ongoing Bitcoin price play out leading into a bear market is now one of the most pressing questions in the crypto industry. Right now, Bitcoin is trading between $87,700 and $88,000, which is a 30% drop from the all-time high it reached in October 2025. Price action alone often leaves room for debate, but on-chain data is beginning to offer clearer guidance. Notably, analysis from CryptoQuant shows that Bitcoin’s internal market structure is shifting in a way that aligns more closely with early-stage bear market conditions. BCMI Drops Below Equilibrium The important bear market signal is from Bitcoin’s Combined Market Index, or BCMI, which is a composite indicator that blends price behavior with on-chain momentum. According to Woo Minkyu, a verified analyst on the CryptoQuant platform, Bitcoin’s BCMI returned to the 0.5 level in October. This was initially interpreted as a cooling phase rather than a definitive cycle top. At the time, the assumption was that Bitcoin was consolidating after an extended rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Remains Stuck Inside This Range, But A Breakout Could Follow However, that view has weakened with the deterioration of market conditions. Particularly, Bitcoin’s price action has declined materially since late October, and the BCMI has fallen in tandem with the price. This joint decline suggests the market has reset not only through time but also through valuation and participation. As shown on the chart below, the BCMI has now slipped below its equilibrium zone, and this is a development that is known to coincide with transitions into bearish phases, where rallies tend to be capped, and downside risks increase. A closer look at prior Bitcoin cycles adds more context to the current setup. In both 2019 and 2023, meaningful cycle bottoms formed only after BCMI compressed into the 0.25 to 0.35 range. Those levels reflected deep sentiment compression, washed-out positioning, and a structural reset of the market. At current readings, Bitcoin’s Combined Market Index is less than 0.4. This reading is below equilibrium but still well above a bottom zone. This opens the possibility that the market is transitioning into a bear phase, not just experiencing a pullback. According to the analyst, a more durable bottom may only form if history repeats itself and the BCMI revisits 2019-2023 levels. Weak Sentiment Adds To Bear Market Evidence Market sentiment is also supporting the idea that Bitcoin is moving deeper into a bearish phase. Optimism has been really scarce in recent weeks, with traders showing little confidence that the price has found a sustainable floor. CoinMarketCap’s Crypto Fear and Greed Index is currently posting a reading of 28, which places sentiment firmly in the Fear zone. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Bull And Bear Cases That Crypto Traders Should Know About This poor sentiment backdrop has been affirmed by industry commentary. For instance, Changpeng Zhao recently noted that many investors only wish they had bought Bitcoin early when prices were already at all-time highs. In practice, those early accumulations happened during periods like the present one, when fear, uncertainty, and doubt dominate market psychology.

    "body": "Crypto analyst Steph has pointed to an “interesting” chart, which has previously led to an XRP price rally. This came as the analyst also suggested that the altcoin may be forming a bottom in preparation for the next leg to the upside. Analyst Shares Why This Chart Is Interesting For The XRP Price In an X post, Steph highlighted the 3-week XRP price chart, stating that it was “interesting” for one reason. He revealed that the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 0.00 on the 3-week timeframe, which is extremely rare and has only happened once before, which was the 2022 bear market bottom. Related Reading: Pundit Explains Why This Changes Everything For XRP In The Long Term Steph further explained that on such a high timeframe, this indicator only reaches zero when selling pressure is fully exhausted, which is a positive for the XRP price. The analyst added that this means that momentum to the downside has dried up, although he warned that this doesn’t mean that price must instantly reverse. Steph noted that the last time this signal appeared, the XRP price entered a long accumulation phase before the next major move higher. As such, the analyst claimed that this again suggests that the downside risk is structurally limited and that long-term holders are absorbing supply rather than distributing. He further remarked that these signals tend to mark cycle lows rather than short-term trades. The XRP ETFs also mark a positive for the XRP price as these funds maintain their inflows streak. These funds have recorded daily inflows since the Canary’s fund launched on November 13. As a result, they now boast net assets of over $1.1 billion, even as XRP continues to see significant demand from institutional investors. XRP Remains Below Key Levels In an X post, CryptoXLarge stated that on the weekly chart, the XRP price remains below the descending trendline around the 8 to 21 EMA levels. He further remarked that this week, the price is attempting to break below the key support zone around $1.95, which aligns with the Fib 0.5 level and the 89-week EMA, which is a support that has held throughout the year. Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Keeps Crashing CryptoXLarge stated that a weekly close below this level could increase the probability of a move toward the $1.60 support, which is the Fib 0.618. Meanwhile, a weekly close above $1.95 may boost buying interest, which could trigger a relief XRP price rally toward $2.30 and then $2.70. Crypto analyst Crypto King also echoed a similar sentiment, stating that a reclaim of $1.98 could eventually send the altcoin to as high as $3.66. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.87, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "According to reports, Ethereum plans two major hard forks in 2026 that aim to change how the network runs. Mid-2026 will see the Glamsterdam upgrade, and late 2026 is set for Heze-Bogota. These steps are meant to speed up transaction handling, add new validation tools, and make the chain harder to censor. Related Reading: Could XRP Make Trillionaires? Tech Firm Founder Thinks It’s Possible Ethereum Trading, Options Pressure Ethereum is currently above $2,900 as the market awaits a large options expiry. Reports put the expiring notional at $6 billion, with more call options than puts. Many contracts could end up worthless if ETH fails to rise above $3,100, the so-called max pain level. Analysts see a consolidation range between $2,700 and $3,100 into year-end, and some experts offer a bearish 2026 view, pointing to possible drops toward $1,800–$2,000 if broader market conditions worsen. Parallel Execution Glamsterdam targets parallel processing by letting multiple transactions run at the same time instead of one after another. Block access lists will tell nodes which data each transaction needs, which makes parallel work safer and more efficient. Ethereum will undergo key upgrades in 2026, with the Glamsterdam fork enabling parallel processing and increasing the gas limit to 200 million, up from 60 million. Validators will shift to validating ZK proofs, paving the way for Ethereum L1 to achieve 10,000 transactions per… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 25, 2025 Protocol-level proposer-builder separation, or ePBS, is also planned. That move is expected to cut some centralization risks and make it easier for validators to use zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs without being penalized for extra compute time. Gas limits are expected to rise in stages, with talk of reaching 200 million per block after key changes land. About 10% of validators could start verifying ZK proofs rather than rechecking all transactions by year-end, based on current projections. The push toward parallel execution could reduce slowdowns that happen when demand spikes. But higher gas limits come with tradeoffs. Running bigger blocks or faster workloads can raise hardware needs, which could make it harder for smaller validators to stay in the network. That balance between speed and decentralization will be watched closely. Layer-2 Throughput Could Jump Sharply A major part of the story is layer-2 scaling. Increasing the number of data blobs per block to 72 or more would give L2 systems much more space to store transaction data, which could let them process hundreds of thousands of transactions per second in aggregate. Designs like ZKsync’s Elastic Network aim to let users keep money on Ethereum while using faster L2s. An interoperability layer is also being discussed to move activity between different L2s more easily. Still, user experience, liquidity splits, and coordination between chains remain open issues that need work.

Heze-Bogota: Censorship Resistance Heze-Bogota will add tools to help groups of validators make sure certain transactions are included. Fork-choice inclusion lists are meant to reduce the risk that transactions get blocked if only part of the network remains honest. That change is more about values and permissionless access than it is about raw speed. Featured image from Firi, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "Crypto analyst Cryptollica (@Cryptollica on X) is arguing that Dogecoin’s weekly chart is doing that familiar thing again: carving out a rounded base, bleeding off volatility, resetting momentum and quietly setting up what he frames as the “calm before the storm.” Or, at least, that’s the pitch. In a Dec. 23 TradingView analysis titled “DOGE: The Cycle Repeats (1W Timeframe),” Cryptollica calls the current structure a “textbook fractal setup,” pointing to four prior “structural points (1, 2, 3, 4)” across DOGE’s longer-term history and claiming the market is now sitting at “Point 4.” The core claim is less about a single indicator and more about pattern recognition: “the structure is rhyming perfectly with the pre-bull run accumulation phases of the past.” Will Dogecoin Repeat History? Cryptollica frames Zones 1 and 2 as prior “boredom phases” — the type of long, dead-feeling stretches that, in hindsight, look like accumulation. “Zones 1 & 2: These were the ‘boredom phases’ where volatility died, and smart money accumulated,” the post reads. Zone 2, in particular, is described as “the launchpad for the massive 2021 parabolic run.” The current period, which the analyst labels Zone 4, is presented as a near-mirror: “We are seeing the exact same rounding bottom formation. The price is stabilizing, forming a heavy base just like it did before the previous explosions.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Rally If It Reclaims This Fibonacci Level That’s the structural argument. The momentum argument is RSI, and Cryptollica is unusually direct about how they’re treating it: “Look at the RSI indicator at the bottom. The red line (~32. level) acts as a historical floor.” They add that “every single time the weekly RSI touched or hovered near this baseline (Points 1, 2, and 3), it marked a macro bottom.” Right now, in their read, “the RSI has reset back to this critical support level,” which they interpret as seller fatigue: “It indicates that the sellers are exhausted and the momentum is primed to flip.” If you’ve been around crypto markets long enough, you’ve seen this exact rhetorical move: the past as a template, the present as a rhyme, the future as a pending punchline. Cryptollica tries to pre-empt the eye-roll by insisting the setup isn’t coincidence: “This isn’t just random noise; it’s a cyclical reset.” The post argues DOGE is sitting in what they call “the ‘Golden Pocket’ for accumulation,” and suggests that if the 2020-era analog holds “like it did in 2020 (Zone 2)” then today’s price action is basically quiet loading time. The editorial machinery at TradingView itself leaned in. The platform responded publicly on Dec. 23 that the publication “has been selected as one of our Editor’s Picks and will be featured on the Home Page,” adding a line that reads like the house style for community encouragement: “Good trading plans are valuable, regardless of their outcomes, and particularly rewarding when they succeed.” Cryptollica replied in kind: “TradingView, thank you.” Related Reading: Dogecoin: Why This One Price Level Is Drawing All the Attention Still, one of the more useful parts of this whole thread is a cautionary comment from another user, ZarinSyed, who essentially says: yes, the fractal is interesting, no, that doesn’t mean it’s fate. “The fractal analysis is compelling,” they wrote, “however, while the setup does resemble prior accumulation phases, it’s worth noting that fractals are not deterministic — macro conditions and liquidity flows can alter outcomes.” They put a practical marker on what “confirmation” would look like in their view: “Watching DOGE’s weekly close above the $0.15–$0.17 range could validate the bullish thesis.” And they don’t let RSI off the hook, either. The ~32 level may signal exhaustion, they concede, but “momentum confirmation often requires a sustained move above the midline (50). Until then, the risk of prolonged sideways action remains.” They add a market-structure wrinkle that matters for 2026-style crypto narratives: “Unlike 2020, DOGE now trades in a more mature market with ETF-driven institutional flows. Retail-driven fractals may play out differently.” So what does it mean, in plain trader terms, without pretending the chart is prophecy? Cryptollica is making a high-conviction, weekly-timeframe claim that DOGE is back in an accumulation “buy zone,” with RSI near a historical floor and a rounded base that resembles prior cycle setups. ZarinSyed is basically saying: fine, now prove it, ideally with a breakout and follow-through, and keep an eye on relative metrics like DOGE/BTC dominance if you want to know whether this is a DOGE story or just another alt wobble.

    "title": "Flare Launches New Way For XRP Investors To Earn",
    "body": "Flare Network has rolled out a new yield-focused product in collaboration with Upshift and Clearstar that offers XRP holders a way to earn returns without selling their XRP holdings. XRP’s price action has been bearish in recent weeks, and that calm has carried into the past trading sessions. The cryptocurrency is trading around $1.87, after staying confined between roughly $1.83 on the downside and $1.88 on the upside in the latest session. This subdued price behavior has preoccupied recent discussions, but development around its ecosystem has continued quietly in the background. Flare Launches New XRP Product Flare Network has officially introduced a new product designed to expand what XRP holders can do with their cryptocurrencies besides holding or trading. The product, which is called earnXRP, is positioned as the first on-chain yield solution that is fully denominated in XRP, and at the same time, addresses a long-standing gap in the ecosystem where earning yield typically required moving into stablecoins or other assets. Related Reading: The Decision That Could Change Everything For XRP Investors The launch is built around Flare’s FAssets system, which allows XRP to be represented on the network as FXRP on a one-to-one basis. To participate in earnXRP, holders deposit FXRP (XRP represented 1:1 on Flare) directly into an on-chain vault, where those assets are deployed across yield-generating strategies. In return, users receive a receipt token that tracks their deposited FXRP along with any yield accrued over time, with earnings remaining fully denominated in XRP. Users receive earnXRP, which represents the user’s deposited FXRP plus any yield generated over time. This structure removes much of the complexity typically associated with DeFi participation. Strategy execution, rebalancing, and compounding are handled within the vault. Users can also request withdrawals at any time, a process where their earnXRP tokens are burned, and FXRP is returned to their wallet. Muted Price Reaction For The Altcoin Flare’s earnXRP is one of the few avenues XRP holders can participate in DeFi. FXRP is a 1:1 ERC-20 representation of XRP that unlocks DeFi utility not possible on the XRP Ledger alone. Related Reading: XRP Price Falls To Critical Support Level, Is It Time To Panic? “Only 0.1% of XRP supply is utilized in DeFi, despite it being the 5th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Users have not had an easy way to capture sustainably high returns. We’re excited to work with Flare and Clearstar to unlock XRP yield using the new Flare XRP Yield vault,” said Ethan, Growth Lead at Upshift. Despite the significance of the launch from a utility standpoint, the immediate market response has been limited. XRP is still trading within its recent range, with the price still below $1.9 and showing little reaction to the announcement. This response shows that the altcoin is currently heavily influenced by broader market conditions and macro sentiment, which have weighed on price action across the entire sector.

    "title": "Saylor Reveals What Will Drive Bitcoin Price To New ATHs – It’s Not What You Think",
    "body": "Bitcoin price dynamics heading into the next market cycle are being reframed by Michael Saylor, who argues that the forces capable of pushing Bitcoin to new all-time highs have little to do with speculation, retail enthusiasm, or ETF-driven flows. Instead, Saylor’s outlook positions Bitcoin price appreciation as the outcome of a deeper structural transition that is unfolding quietly within the banking system. Michael Saylor On Bitcoin Price’s Structural Shift As the market looks toward 2026, Michael Saylor’s thesis on Bitcoin price action focuses on a structural shift away from trader-driven dynamics toward regulated financial institutions, a transition that could fundamentally reshape how capital engages with Bitcoin at scale. For most of its history, Bitcoin price discovery has been dominated by cyclical trading behavior, leverage, and sentiment-driven momentum. Related Reading: Why The Current XRP Valuation Doesn’t Make Sense Even milestones such as spot Bitcoin ETFs, while broadening access, largely remain confined to traditional capital markets. Saylor’s view departs from this model by highlighting Bitcoin’s gradual integration into bank balance sheets, where valuation is driven by utility, collateralization, and long-term capital allocation rather than short-term market cycles. Recent developments underscore this shift. A growing number of major US banks have begun offering Bitcoin-collateralized loans, a move that signals a reclassification of Bitcoin from a high-volatility trading asset to a recognized form of financial collateral. Lending against Bitcoin reflects institutional confidence in its liquidity, custody standards, and long-term value stability. In practical terms, this positions Bitcoin alongside assets that are suitable for credit creation rather than short-term speculation. Once Bitcoin is integrated into lending structures, treasury operations, and institutional risk models, demand characteristics change materially. Capital deployed through these channels is not reactive to short-term price fluctuations. It is strategic, compliance-driven, and designed for multi-year horizons. This type of demand absorbs supply consistently, reinforcing scarcity dynamics already embedded in Bitcoin’s fixed issuance model. As a result, Bitcoin price appreciation becomes a function of sustained capital allocation rather than episodic market rallies. Banking Infrastructure And The New Ceiling For Bitcoin Price Saylor identifies 2026 as the period when the impact of banking adoption becomes fully visible. Major financial institutions such as Charles Schwab and Citigroup, planning to roll out Bitcoin custody and related services, point to a broader alignment between Bitcoin and regulated financial infrastructure. Related Reading: $130 Million XRP Fumble: Analyst Reveals What Went Wrong Custody plays a pivotal role in this process. When banks custody Bitcoin, they unlock the ability to embed it across wealth management platforms, corporate treasury strategies, and secured lending products. This dramatically expands Bitcoin’s addressable capital base by enabling participation from institutions previously constrained by regulatory, operational, or fiduciary limitations. As banking participation deepens, Bitcoin price behavior is likely to evolve. Volatility driven by leveraged trading and speculative positioning diminishes in relative importance, while long-term balance-sheet accumulation becomes a dominant force. In this environment, according to Saylor, Bitcoin’s new all-time highs will not be the product of sudden euphoria but the result of sustained absorption by institutions operating at scale.

The market is now grappling with significant net outflows, as data confirms that investment flows have turned decisively negative.

Why Markets Move Before Narratives Catch Up In an X post, a trader and investor in stocks and crypto, WealthManager, revealed that since December 8th, Bitcoin has recorded approximately $716 million in net outflows. Over the past two weeks, flows have been dominated almost entirely by outflows, reflecting a market that has lost momentum rather than conviction. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Crash Incoming?

Analyst Cipher2X has offered an insight into why he is accumulating Bitcoin ahead of 2026. According to Cipher2X, BTC has never waited for perfect conditions to do its most important work. It builds its foundations when liquidity is tight and expectations are low. At this stage, price action is misleading, but the structure is not. On-chain data has shown that supply is increasingly locked up with long-term holders, while access to BTC through regulated channels is becoming routine rather than exceptional. At the same time, micro uncertainty continues to reinforce BTC’s role as a hedge against policy risk, not as a speculative bet on growth. This setup is the kind of environment where BTC intends to move sideways, frustrate the traders, and quietly shift ownership from impatient hands to committed ones. Cipher2X explains that the purpose of accumulating BTC isn’t a short-term catalyst, but because the next regime tends to reward those who have positioned early, not those who have reacted late. 2026 isn’t about the hype; it’s about who was already holding the asset. What Falling Volatility Says About Bitcoin’s Maturity The Bitcoin chart has shown the implied volatility on the BTC options over the past few years. A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, pointed out that aside from a few short spikes of volatility, there’s a clear trend down on this part. BTC is maturing as its market cap is growing over time, and the market is becoming more institutionalized.
