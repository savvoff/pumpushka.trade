    "title": "Will Bitcoin Price Crash Today? BlackRock’s BTC Moves Shakes Market",
    "body": "BlackRock has transferred a significant amount of BTC to the crypto exchange Coinbase, sparking concerns about a sell-off. This comes as the Bitcoin price continues to struggle to break above $90,000 successfully. Bitcoin Price At Risk as BlackRock Transfers BTC Arkham data shows that Blackrock deposited 2,201 BTC ($192.13 million) into Coinbase, putting the Bitcoin price at risk of further decline amid increasing selling pressure. The move followed the outflow recorded by BlackRock’s BTC ETF on December 26, with Bitcoin funds as a group seeing a net outflow of $275.88 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin News: Here’s How Much Was Liquidated In The Crypto Market In 2025 These Bitcoin ETFs are currently on a seven-day outflow streak, which also prompted BlackRock to deposit 6,174.39 BTC last week, likely to offload these coins and redeem shares of its BTC fund. The Bitcoin price has struggled to break above $90,000 amid these outflows from the BTC funds. Notably, the Bitcoin price had broken above $90,000 on December 28 but quickly lost those gains yesterday as BlackRock moved the coins to Coinbase. Crypto pundit Martini claimed that BlackRock wasn’t the only one putting significant selling pressure on the flagship crypto. He alleged that Binance, Wintermute, Coinbase, and Fidelity also sold a significant amount of BTC, collectively dumping $3.5 billion yesterday. Crypto pundit Bull Theory claimed that there was a weekend manipulation as the Bitcoin price pumped $3,000 and broke $90,000, liquidating $103 million worth of shorts this Sunday. He then noted that on Monday morning, BTC dumped $2,700 and liquidated $40 million worth of longs, erasing its entire pump in the process. With the current price action, BTC is heading for a red yearly close, as it is currently down over 6% year-to-date (YTD). BTC Could Bottom Out Soon Against Other Major Assets In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that most of the data continues to become more favorable for the Bitcoin price, putting in a bottom against the equity markets and gold in the coming weeks. He added that the data also points to the flagship crypto outperforming these assets. The analyst stated that this was based on just factual data and not emotions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Entered A Bear Market, And This Data Backs It Up The Bitcoin price had notably outperformed these major assets at the start of the year but has since fallen behind, following the October 10 crypto crash. Gold is up 66% year-to-date while the S&P 500 is up 17% since the start of the year. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows also predicted that BTC could soon rally, noting that the long-term holders have stopped selling for the first time since July 2025. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $87,300, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "body": "Solana (SOL) is retesting a make-or-break area that could set the stage for a major move at the start of next year. Some analysts have suggested that altcoin’s chart signals a bearish performance for the coming months. Related Reading: Here’s Why Bitcoin Advocate Max Keiser Restates Bullish Outlook For 2025 Solana Faces Another Rejection From Key Resistance After hitting a three-week high of $130 on Sunday, Solana started the week with a 6.1% correction to the $122 area. The cryptocurrency recently breached below its macro support around the $120 zone, hitting an eight-month low of $116 in mid-December. Since then, the altcoin has been trading between the $120-$126 mark, attempting to break out of the local resistance multiple times but ultimately being rejected after each retest. SOL’s price surged around 5.6% toward during Sunday’s broader market bounce, trying to build a base below the crucial resistance level before plunging after the early Monday correction. Amid this performance, market observer Crypto Jobs pointed out that Solana had broken out of a six-week falling wedge, which could target the $144-$146 area if momentum holds and price confirms a retest of the breakout. However, the star-of-week pullback has momentarily sent SOL below the pattern’s upper boundary. Analyst Man of Bitcoin also highlighted that the cryptocurrency had broken above a one-month downtrend line, which suggested an initial move toward the $129-$130 area. The analyst explained that “holding above the broken trendline is key to maintaining upside momentum,” but noted that as long as the price remains below $146, a scenario where price is headed for one more low, around the $100-105 horizontal support, remains likely. Following the Monday rejection, he affirmed that “it could be that wave-4 is already complete. A decisive break below the trendline would confirm this further.” SOL’s Higher Timeframe Chart Shows Troubling Signs Market watcher Elite Crypto affirmed that Solana “doesn’t look very strong” on the higher timeframe, pointing to a multi-year bearish pattern potentially forming on SOL’s chart. According to X analysis, the cryptocurrency has been developing a Head and Shoulder pattern since early 2024, with the neckline sitting around the $105 area in the weekly timeframe. The char shows that left shoulder formed during the Q1 2024 rally, while the head and right shoulder formed during its rally to its latest all-time high (ATH) in Q1 and Q3 2025 breakouts, respectively. “If $SOL loses the $105 support then the price could move down to the $75–$51 range and this phase may last until mid 2026,” the investor detailed, adding that “after this period, the overall trend for SOL can turn bullish and set up a better move ahead.” Similarly, Henry from Lord of Alts suggested that Solana has formed a double top formation with the neckline around the current levels instead of a Head and Shoulders pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Red Yearly Close: Galaxy Digital Explains The Setup Per the analyst, “We put in a clean double top, rolled over, and now price is going back toward a zone that’s acted as real support before.” If the altcoin fails to hold the current support, its price could retrace toward the $60 mark, the chart shows. Moreover, he added that SOL’s price could also risk a drop to the $35 area in the coming months as there’s “a big gap below that market hasn’t dealt with yet.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Key Catalyst For Potential Surge Toward $150,000 Next Year",
    "body": "As Bitcoin (BTC) maintains a consolidated trading range between $86,000 and $90,000 after experiencing a 30% correction from its all-time high in October, market expectations for the cryptocurrency’s future remain optimistic. Market analyst Dominic Basulto from The Motley Fool believes that despite the persistent challenges seen in the fourth quarter of the year, Bitcoin could soar to $150,000 by 2026, fueled by the newly established US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Is $150,000 Possible For Bitcoin? Historical context supports Basulto’s prediction; Bitcoin’s performance over the years has shown significant recovery potential, with 2015 marking its worst bull market year at just a 36% gain. Significantly, in seven of its years, Bitcoin has achieved triple-digit percentage returns. The analyst suggests that 2026 may resemble 2019, a year when Bitcoin appreciated by 95% following the dismal performance in 2018, when it plummeted by 74%. Related Reading: XRP Supply Shock Incoming? Expert Reveals The Truth In 2019, several catalysts, such as heightened global economic uncertainty and a surge in institutional interest, propelled Bitcoin upwards—situations that appear similar to current conditions. Institutional investors are increasingly adding BTC to their portfolios, driven by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Meanwhile, concerns over global tariffs and macroeconomic instability in the US continue to resonate among investors, setting the stage for potential bullish movement. However, Basulto emphasizes that Bitcoin can only reach the $150,000 milestone if it is perceived as a long-term store of value. If investors view it merely as another high-risk asset, they may choose to favor physical gold over digital gold, which has seen a record-breaking year. The crux of his argument centers on one pivotal factor that could significantly impact Bitcoin’s price: a notable increase in purchases by the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. What Happens If Nations Stockpile BTC? Basulto claims that if the US government were to start buying substantial quantities of Bitcoin, it could trigger a global arms race among other countries keen to create their own strategic BTC reserves. According to the analyst, such purchases from national reserves could dramatically inflate Bitcoin’s price, likely surpassing the impact of corporate treasury companies that have already amassed close to 5% of the world’s circulating BTC supply. Related Reading: Investment Firm CEO Drops Utility Bomb On XRP, Is Community Hype A Detriment? Although reaching the $150,000 mark may seem ambitious given Bitcoin’s recent performance, more aggressive predictions exist for 2026. For instance, JPMorgan Chase has forecasted a potential price of $170,000, while Wall Street strategist Tom Lee from Fundstrat has suggested that BTC might even hit $250,000 next year. While a variety of factors must align for BTC to reclaim its status as digital gold, the possibility of elevated prices hinges on strategic actions by both the US government and institutional investors. Basulto concluded that if the leading cryptocurrency can consolidate its position and the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve gains traction, the predicted price of $150,000 could be achieved by next year. At the time of writing, BTC’s price retraced towards $87,330 following an early Monday move above $90,500. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Selling Pressure Returns: Investors Shift From Holding to Distribution",
    "body": "XRP is trading below critical technical levels after losing the $2 mark, a breakdown that has shifted market sentiment decisively toward fear. Bulls are struggling to find reliable support as price action weakens, and recent attempts at stabilization have failed to attract sustained demand. The loss of this psychological and structural level has left XRP vulnerable, with traders increasingly positioning defensively amid broader uncertainty across the altcoin market. Related Reading: Why $100,000 Is Bitcoin’s Most Important Resistance Level According to analysis shared by Darkfost, selling pressure on XRP has intensified materially over recent weeks. The data shows that the current move is not a minor pullback, but part of a deeper corrective phase. XRP has declined by roughly 50% from its cycle peak near $3.66, falling toward the $1.85 region. This magnitude of decline reflects a clear shift in market behavior, as earlier optimism has given way to risk reduction and capital preservation. Darkfost’s assessment suggests that the increase in selling is driven by a combination of profit-taking from older positions and capitulation from more recent buyers who entered at higher levels. As the price moves further away from prior highs, confidence has deteriorated, reinforcing the downside momentum. Exchange Inflows Highlight Rising Sell-Side Pressure Darkfost further explains that the recent surge in selling pressure becomes especially clear when examining XRP inflows to exchanges, with Binance standing out as the primary focal point. As the exchange that concentrates the largest share of XRP trading volume, Binance often serves as an early indicator of shifting market intent. Rising inflows to exchanges are commonly interpreted as a signal that holders are preparing to sell, particularly when the increase is sudden and sustained. After several weeks of relatively calm conditions, characterized by stable and moderate inflows, this pattern changed sharply around December 15. Since then, XRP transfers to Binance have accelerated, with daily inflows consistently ranging between 35 million XRP and a pronounced spike of roughly 116 million XRP recorded on December 19. This marks a clear break from the prior holding-oriented behavior observed through much of October and November. The shift in inflow dynamics suggests a change in investor psychology. Longer-term holders appear to be taking profits after XRP’s strong run earlier in the cycle, while more recent entrants are increasingly capitulating and selling at a loss as the price continues to slide. This combination amplifies downside pressure and reinforces the current corrective trend. As long as elevated exchange inflows persist, conditions for accumulation remain unfavorable. Without a meaningful slowdown in deposits, XRP is likely to struggle to form a durable base, increasing the risk that the correction extends further in both time and depth. Related Reading: Trust Wallet Exploit Drains $7M: Hundreds Of Users Affected XRP Price Action Details: Testing Demand XRP continues to trade under clear technical pressure, with price hovering near the $1.87–$1.90 zone after a prolonged downtrend on the daily chart. The structure shows a decisive loss of bullish control following the rejection from the $3.00–$3.50 region earlier in the year. Since that peak, XRP has consistently printed lower highs and lower lows, confirming a bearish market structure that remains intact. From a trend perspective, the price is trading below all major moving averages. The short-term moving average has turned sharply lower and now acts as immediate dynamic resistance, while the medium- and long-term averages are also sloping downward, reinforcing the broader bearish bias. Each recent attempt at a relief bounce has failed below these averages, suggesting that sellers continue to dominate rallies. Related Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Inflows Collapse While Binance Retains Relative Activity – Details The $1.80–$1.85 region is now a critical support area. This zone has absorbed several tests in recent weeks, indicating short-term demand, but the lack of a strong rebound highlights weak buying conviction. A clean break below this level would expose XRP to a deeper retracement toward the $1.50 region, where historical demand previously emerged. Unless XRP can reclaim the $2.10–$2.20 range and hold above it, the path of least resistance remains to the downside, with risks skewed toward further consolidation or continuation of the correction.

    "title": "Dogecoin Chart Mirrors Silver’s Breakout, Analyst Flags $9+ Scenario",
    "body": "Silver has staged a historic, late-December breakout, surging from roughly $50 an ounce in mid-November to an intraday all-time high above $83, before easing slightly as traders took profits. Will Dogecoin follow its lead? At press time, spot silver was holding near $76 after pulling back from the earlier record high of $83.62, with the metal up roughly 181% year-to-date in 2025, an outsized move for the precious-metal. The rally is attributed to a mix of macro and market-structure drivers including expectations for easier US monetary policy in 2026, strong industrial and investment demand, persistent supply shortfalls, and silver’s recent designation as a US “critical mineral,” which added a policy-sensitive supply narrative to an already tight market. The ‘Silver Fractal’ Pitch For Dogecoin That silver move is now being used as a visual analog in crypto. X analyst Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) posted a side-by-side TradingView comparison suggesting Dogecoin’s 6-month chart resembles silver’s 3-day structure from three weeks ago, implying DOGE could be positioned for a similarly persistent advance if the fractal holds. In the shared DOGE 6-month panel, Cantonese Cat shows a large selloff candle and frames it as a potential cyclical low. Based on the silver comparison, the interpretation is not “DOGE pumps next week,” but “DOGE trends for years.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Triangle Formation Breakdown Spells Trouble As 15% Move Nears – Time To Be Cautious? In the proposed fractal path, the current 6-month candle would mark the bottom, followed by eight additional 6-month candles spanning roughly four years where seven are green and only one is red. The lone red candle is mapped as the third in the sequence, implying the first half of 2027 could be a down half-year even within an overarching uptrend. If the pattern were to track silver “exactly,” the projected cycle peak would land in the second half of 2029, with a peak price “above $11” in that window. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Repeating Its 2020 Accumulation Cycle, Analyst Says How It Fits His Earlier Wave Framework The comparison follows Cantonese Cat’s earlier Dec. 20 post outlining a longer-horizon DOGE roadmap on the weekly chart. “We’ve already had a 13 month bear market for DOGE, with my working hypothesis of this being likely a wave 2 correction prior to wave 3 explosion,” the analyst wrote. The accompanying weekly DOGE chart labels the prior advance as “Wave 1” and the subsequent decline as “Wave 2,” with a descending trendline drawn across the multi-year structure. The Dec. 20 weekly snapshot shows DOGE around $0.13160 with retracement levels including 0.382 at about $0.11771, and 0.236 at about $0.08427, with the base (“0”) around $0.04909. Above the current price, the analysis maps 0.5 at about $0.15422 as the next resistance, followed by 0.618 at about $0.20205, 0.707 at about $0.24770, 0.786 at about $0.29681, and 0.886 at about $0.37315, before the 1.0 level near $0.48442. Above the prior high, the same map plots extension targets often used in Elliott Wave projection frameworks, labeled near 1.272 ($0.90288), 1.414 ($1.24968), 1.618 ($1.99344), 2 ($4.77927), and 2.272 ($8.90771). The implication is conditional: the extensions matter only if DOGE completes the corrective phase and reclaims the prior impulse high.

    "title": "XRP Still Has A Path To $28 This Cycle, Analyst Says",
    "body": "XRP could still reach $28 this cycle under a “non-base-case” scenario driven by an altcoin-heavy rotation, according to CryptoInsightUK analyst Will Taylor, who argued that XRP’s multi-year technical compression leaves room for an outsized move if market structure and sentiment align. In his Dec. 27 “Weekly Insight” newsletter, Taylor framed the call inside a broader thesis: that capital chasing breakouts in traditional markets could eventually rotate into crypto, amplifying returns given crypto’s smaller aggregate market cap. Within that setup, XRP is his “core position,” and the token he sees as a primary beneficiary if altcoins capture a larger share of the cycle’s upside. Can XRP Still Reach $28 This Cycle? Taylor’s XRP outlook is tied to his expectation that total crypto market cap can reach roughly $10 trillion this cycle, a level he characterized as consistent with prior cycle behavior. The more important variable, in his view, is where Bitcoin dominance lands if that scenario plays out. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Inflows Spike To End 2025: Will Price Decline Deepen? He wrote that dominance could fall into the “35.3 percent and 31.5 percent range,” which would imply Bitcoin at roughly a $3 trillion to $4 trillion market cap in that environment and “leave the door open for around six trillion dollars to flow into altcoins.” That’s the backdrop for his XRP targets: not a claim about XRP alone, but a wager on the size of the altcoin pie if the market turns risk-on. Taylor also pointed to a prior discussion with trader Credible Crypto as an example of how high-cycle targets can emerge when liquidity, positioning, and sentiment converge. “My pinned post on X is a conversation with Credible Crypto where he talks about how, for example, XRP could go to $26 if the stars align for a cycle like this,” Taylor wrote. “And right now, it genuinely feels like those stars are starting to align.” Taylor disclosed that XRP is the overwhelming majority of his portfolio, a disclosure he flagged as a potential bias. “As you guys know, I am around 90 percent XRP in my portfolio, so I definitely have some bias here,” he wrote, before laying out a profit-taking framework centered on a mid-cycle target zone. “I would not be too surprised to see XRP reach a minimum of eight to thirteen dollars,” Taylor wrote. “I have discussed many times that I would be taking a lot of profit in that range, with an outside maximum target of up to around twenty eight dollars.” Related Reading: XRP Supply Shock Incoming? Expert Reveals The Truth He tied the higher-end target to a technical read of XRP’s long consolidation and the possibility that an altcoin-led cycle could be larger than many investors expect. Taylor described the $28 level as derived from the “initial breakout from the 2017 to 2018 cycle,” while emphasizing he had deliberately “diminished expectations” versus modeling a more aggressive, multi-leg extension. Even so, his risk management plan is explicit about reducing exposure in the $8 to $13 band. “As I have said before, I plan to heavily de leverage between eight and thirteen dollars if we are offered that opportunity,” he wrote. “I will not be selling all of my bags, though, because I do think there is an outside chance that we push higher, potentially toward the twenty eight dollar area.” The Argument For XRP Taylor’s core claim is that XRP’s structure is different from many large-cap alts because it has, in his view, spent longer in “compression” and is now emerging from it. He argued XRP “has experienced longer compression than most altcoins, has broken out of an eight year trend, and has held previous seven year resistance as support.” He also suggested that a favorable US policy narrative could act as an accelerant in a euphoric phase, pointing to “the rhetoric around US companies,” the “US Clarity Act,” and Ripple “remaining based in the US” as factors that could make a higher-end outcome less implausible in a risk-on environment. Still, Taylor repeatedly stressed that the $28 figure is not his central expectation. “That being said, and I want to be very clear on this, this is not my primary target,” he wrote. “My primary target is and has been between eight and twelve dollars, potentially stretching to fifteen or sixteen dollars this cycle. The move toward twenty eight dollars is an outside scenario, not a base case.” At press time, XRP traded at $1.86. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Investor Paul Barron’s hint at “big news” has reignited attention on XRP exchange-traded funds this week, sending the community into speculation over possible upcoming announcements or launches. Related Reading: Crypto Heat Fizzling Out? US Search Interest Plunges As Retail Shy Away Traders and holders reacted fast on social channels, pushing chatter and price focus higher even as specifics remain unclear. ETF Flows Heat Up According to data shared by Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs dominated year-to-date inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF led with $25 billion in inflows. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF followed at $1.11 billion. Fidelity and VanEck posted $477 million and $305 million respectively. On the Ethereum side, BlackRock’s offerings recorded about $9.12 billion. A Solana staking ETF from Bitwise pulled in $839 million. These numbers show where most large investors are putting money right now. Expect some big news this week $XRP ETFs https://t.co/3BY5XJosPx — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) December 29, 2025 Community Reaction And Speculation Barron’s remark has been read by many as a hint at another XRP-related announcement. Some expect a new ETF launch; others are watching for updates from issuers already in the market. That talk has helped push attention — and inflows — to XRP products that only debuted late in the year. XRP Ledger Tokenization Surge Based on reports from rwa.xyz, on-chain data indicates tokenized real-world assets on the XRP Ledger rose by 2,200% in 2025. The network saw about 23x growth in the value of native real-world assets, including stablecoins, and crossed the $500 million threshold. Themes around RWA tokenization were widely discussed this year by figures such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and former SEC Chair Paul Atkins, and the XRPL appears to be drawing benefit from that interest. XRP ETFs Show Early Strength Canary’s XRP ETF (XRPC) registered $384 million in year-to-date inflows after launching in November. Other XRP spot funds have built sizable holdings too: 21Shares holds about $250 million, Bitwise roughly $227 million, Grayscale around $244 million, and Franklin about $206 million. Based on reports, all of these XRP spot ETFs launched in November and December and now tally roughly $1.24 billion in total assets under management with cumulative inflows near $1.14 billion. For a new category, that level of money moving in over a short span is notable; some industry voices point out the total might have been higher if market mood had not cooled recently. Reports also say XRP ETFs pulled in over $1 billion through 21 days of steady inflows. Pending Products And Rumors WisdomTree’s XRP ETF is among the pending offerings that market watchers expect to arrive next. At the same time, talk about a BlackRock XRP ETF has circulated widely. There is currently no public filing tied to a BlackRock XRP product, and reports caution that such expectations are premature without official filings or approvals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rules The Decade: Outshines Gold And Silver, Analyst Says Current flows note that XRP’s ETF debut has shifted part of investor focus from pure crypto bets to spot ETF allocations and tokenization themes. Whether Barron’s hinted “big news” becomes a concrete catalyst will depend on filings and formal product launches. For now, the mix of solid early inflows and rapid XRPL tokenization growth has put XRP squarely in the conversation among ETF-focused investors and network adopters.

    "body": "US Representative Maxine Waters has formally asked House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill to schedule an oversight hearing with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins, saying the agency must explain recent choices that, she argues, weaken enforcement of securities laws. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rules The Decade: Outshines Gold And Silver, Analyst Says Waters Seeks Answers On Dropped SEC Cases According to Waters’ letter, the SEC has terminated or stayed a number of high-profile crypto enforcement actions that had been moving through the agency’s process, and committee Democrats want an explanation for those decisions. Reports have disclosed that the letter names actions involving Coinbase, Binance, Justin Sun, Kraken, and Ripple among those of concern. The request lists nine areas where the SEC’s recent conduct raises questions for lawmakers, including whether enforcement choices were driven by legal judgment or by outside pressures. Waters, who is the ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, told Chairman Hill that the public deserves clarity about changes to enforcement strategy and about how investor protections will be preserved. Concerns About Politicization And Investor Protections Based on reports, Waters expressed particular alarm that the agency’s handling of cases since US President Donald Trump took office looks different from prior enforcement patterns, and she argues that some moves could amount to an erosion of investor protections. Industry observers and several media outlets have picked up the story, noting the broader context: a year of big shifts in crypto policy and new legislation that has altered the regulatory picture. 🚨 MAXINE WATERS CALLS FOR HEARING ON SEC CHAIR ATKINS’ CRYPTO DECISIONS — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) December 30, 2025 Some outlets say the timing of Waters’ letter—sent late in December—reflects rising pressure from Democrats as they prepare for oversight if they regain more committee influence. What Waters Wants From The SEC In her request, Waters seeks direct answers about why certain cases were dropped or delayed, what internal analyses the SEC relied on, and whether staff reductions or policy shifts affected enforcement. She also asked that Chairman Atkins appear before the committee so members can question him in public. Committee Role And Next Steps Reports indicate the letter was delivered to Chairman Hill on December 29, 2025, and that Waters urged him to set a date for an oversight hearing as soon as possible.

US Search Interest Plunges As Retail Shy Away The committee could use a hearing to examine documents and testimony from SEC officials, and to press for a public accounting of how decisions were made about major crypto matters. How quickly that happens will depend on the committee’s calendar and on whether Hill agrees to a formal public session. The issue has drawn attention because it involves both enforcement of existing securities law and the future of crypto oversight in the US. Investors, industry groups, and lawmakers on both sides are watching to see whether the SEC’s recent moves represent a long-term policy shift or isolated choices tied to individual cases.

    "title": "XRP’s Real Use Case Is Laying The Groundwork For Appreciation — Here’s How",
    "body": "In the evolving landscape, the narrative around XRP’s real use case is increasingly standing out in a market often driven by speculation. The altcoin is embedded in live financial workflows, particularly in cross-border payments and liquidity management. Its role as a bridge asset allows institutions to move value quickly, cheaply, and at scale, solving real inefficiencies in the global payments system. Why XRP Functions As A Bridge Asset In Global Payments This design choice is centered on understanding why its utility will drive price appreciation. An analyst known as SMQKE revealed on X that the core of this model is payment utility. XRP is designed to operate within the global payment infrastructure, and Ripple has integrated with existing financial systems to enhance speed, reduce costs, and improve settlement efficiency. Related Reading: Pundit Shares ‘Urgent Update’ With XRP Community – Here’s What He Said Through Ripple’s integrations, financial institutions adopt the network, and the altcoin is utilized directly to move value across borders. From a price perspective, this document outlines how institutional settlement activity has created a sustainable demand for XRP, supporting price appreciation through real transaction flow. Analyst Vet has highlighted the areas where XRP and the XRP Ledger were great in 2025. One is smart contracts, and a significant amount of development went into getting the alpha testnet live, where individuals can currently deploy and play around with it. Community awareness toward this also increased meaningfully. On the DeFi front, momentum came out strongly from late 2024, especially driven by meme coins. However, the activity dried out over the year. Baseline DEX activity is now higher than it was before the DeFi wave, but this raises the potential for more growth in 2026. Furthermore, interoperability has made tangible progress as Wormhole went live, Axelar live became operational, and yield-bearing issued assets were bridged onto the XRPL. Currently, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) appear to be a key enabler for trust-minimized bridging. On the application side, existing XRPL projects and wallets doubled down. Apps became more polished, with new feature-rich and better integrations, while no new app took over the community. At the same time, tokenization stood out as one of the strongest verticals. RLUSD was a major milestone, complemented by smaller launches of other stablecoins and tokenized funds. The distribution channel of these assets needs a lot of work, which directly ties back to application-layer development. That’s why this year should be viewed as the foundation for 2026. How Fee Destruction Changes Economic Incentives Ripple’s XRP is designed to compete in low-fee markets and has built programmable economics. According to Xfinancebull, every transaction fee is destroyed; it is not paid to validators, no middleman, and there is no inflation loop. Related Reading: Flare Launches New Way For XRP Investors To Earn This is because XRPL is designed to scale global payment rails, not enrich toll collectors. That’s why XRP is one of the few chains where volume is value, not congestion. Xfinancebull stated that this isn’t a trading feature, but it’s a monetary policy shift hidden at the protocol layer.

    "title": "XRP Projected To Reach $8 By 2026: Standard Chartered Identifies Two Major Catalysts",
    "body": "Despite a mixed performance throughout 2025, XRP has emerged as one of the standout performers in the cryptocurrency market. Currently trading slightly below $1.90, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency has retraced nearly 50% from its all-time highs achieved in July. Nevertheless, Standard Chartered is optimistic about XRP’s future, forecasting a significant upward trend driven by anticipated inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and increased regulatory clarity. Spot XRP ETFs Could Drive $4-$8 Billion In Inflows The bank predicts that the launch of spot XRP ETFs could bring in between $4 billion and $8 billion into XRP throughout 2026. Should these inflows materialize, the resulting demand—coupled with XRP’s relatively limited supply—could catalyze a sharp increase in the coin’s price. Related Reading: US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Key Catalyst For Potential Surge Toward $150,000 Next Year Analyst Geoffrey Kendrick has laid out an ambitious roadmap for XRP’s future, anticipating prices of $8.00 in 2026, and potentially reaching $12.50 by 2028. To put this into perspective, XRP’s current circulating supply is approximately 57 billion coins. Even modest inflows of a few billion dollars could create a meaningful supply shock in the market. So far, XRP ETFs have gathered around $1.25 billion. To reach the $8 target, it would require annual flows to hit the range of $5 billion to $10 billion, similar to the initial enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin ETFs. Regulatory Resolution As Key Catalyst A parallel factor influencing XRP’s potential rise is the resolution of regulatory uncertainty surrounding the cryptocurrency. The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) long-standing lawsuit against Ripple Labs has significantly impacted XRP’s narrative. Yet, in August 2025, the SEC withdrew its appeal, resulting in Ripple agreeing to a $125 million settlement and affirming that XRP sales on secondary markets are not classified as securities transactions. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Influx: Strategy Grabs 1,200 BTC, Bitmine Immersion Ups ETH by 44,000 This resolution eliminates a substantial legal burden and is seen by Standard Chartered as a catalyst for increased adoption. With legal uncertainties removed, capital that had been sidelined could finally enter the market. However, for XRP to achieve a price of $8 by 2026, favorable economic conditions, including low interest rates and a risk-on attitude among investors, would be critical. Should macroeconomic challenges escalate, investors may shy away from altcoins. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Price To Rally 690% To $15 In Unexpected ‘Measured Move’",
    "body": "The XRP price may be on the verge of its biggest rally yet, as a crypto analyst has forecast a dramatic 690% surge to $15 soon. According to the expert’s analysis, XRP is undergoing an unexpected measured move that has historically led to explosive price surges. While the current price structure depicts a bearish trend, the analyst remains confident that XRP could recover from the ongoing downside momentum and catch the market off guard with a parabolic move upwards. XRP Price Projected To Reach $15 From Under $2 Crypto market analyst Javon Marks has delivered a new outlook on XRP, highlighting a powerful continuation setup based on historical price behavior. In his analysis, Marks pointed out a measured move structure that previously defined a primary expansion phase for XRP. Related Reading: XRP Stochastic RSI Just Touched 0.0 For The Second Time In History The analyst explained that XRP completed the full measured move after its breakout in 2017, delivering a sharp upside extension. According to him, the same technical conditions are reemerging in XRP’s current market structure, suggesting the potential for another significant price surge. Marks emphasized that if the measured move plays out as expected, XRP could reach uncharted price levels above $15. He revealed that a surge to this point would represent nearly an eightfold increase from current trading levels below $2, equating to gains of more than 690%. Notably, this bullish scenario would mark a significant milestone for XRP, which has never been in double-digit territory and is presently trending downwards. The chart accompanying Marks’ analysis shows a long-term symmetrical triangle pattern that formed after XRP’s previous explosive rally during the 2017-2018 bull cycle. The cryptocurrency’s price had repeatedly respected converging trend lines, indicating sustained accumulation and compression over several years. XRP broke above the upper boundary of this formation in late 2024, mirroring the same breakout seen during the previous cycle when the measured move occurred. This was followed by a strong price rally that continued into early 2025, pushing XRP above $3. Although the cryptocurrency delivered impressive gains for much of 2025, its price has since declined, falling below $2 and now trading at $1.87 after crashing by 15% over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap. A Downtrend Pressure Despite Short-Term Support On the flip side, crypto expert Marcus Cornivus notes that XRP remains in a downtrend, showing no signs of immediate recovery, as its market continues to be weighed down by persistent selling pressure. He said that XRP is holding just above a strong demand zone, where a short-term bounce is possible as buyers attempt to defend this area. Related Reading: XRP Price Must Stay Above This Level Or Crash To $0.9 Cornivus also stated that XRP’s overall trend and the bigger picture are bearish, with lower highs intact and the descending trendline still in control of price action. He highlighted that any bounce that fails to break and hold above the trendline would only lead to a temporary pullback. Additionally, if sellers retreat even briefly, he expects XRP to react sharply. The analyst has also revealed that if the demand zone fails, XRP’s downside continuation may accelerate.

    "title": "XRP Slides To $1.80 While Binance Reserves Continue To Decline",
    "body": "XRP is struggling to regain bullish momentum as persistent selling pressure continues to dominate market conditions. Price action remains weak, and recent attempts at recovery have failed to attract meaningful demand. With bulls largely absent, sentiment across the XRP market has turned defensive, and an increasing number of analysts are warning that the token could face further downside in the coming weeks if current conditions persist. Related Reading: Chainlink Shows Strong Accumulation Signal: LINK Exchange Liquidity Dries Up Despite the bearish tone reflected in price, on-chain data reveals an important structural shift. Data from Binance shows that XRP reserves on the exchange have declined to approximately 2.64 billion XRP, marking their lowest level since 2024. This drop indicates that a significant amount of XRP has been withdrawn from the platform, reducing the supply readily available for immediate sale. In on-chain analysis, falling exchange reserves are typically interpreted as a sign that holders are moving assets into self-custody rather than positioning to sell aggressively. The divergence between weakening price action and declining exchange reserves adds complexity to the outlook. While the market remains under clear pressure and momentum continues to fade, the absence of rising reserves suggests that the recent price decline has not been driven by large-scale exchange selling. Instead, the data points toward weak demand rather than an influx of sell orders. Falling Exchange Reserves Suggest Selling Pressure Is Easing A recent CryptoQuant report highlights a sharp decline in XRP reserves on Binance, pointing to a continued outflow of coins from the exchange. This reduction means fewer tokens are readily available for immediate sale, a dynamic that on-chain analysts typically associate with easing sell-side pressure. Instead of positioning to exit, investors appear to be moving XRP into private wallets, signaling a preference for holding or using assets outside of active trading venues. Arab Chain adds important context to this development. XRP’s price has fallen to around $1.80 after failing to sustain levels above $3, a zone that previously defined the bullish peak of the move. Crucially, this price decline has not been accompanied by an increase in exchange reserves. Related Reading: XRP Selling Pressure Returns: Investors Shift From Holding to Distribution In past market cycles, sharp bearish reversals were often driven by rising reserves, as large inflows to exchanges reflected aggressive selling. That pattern is notably absent this time. The current setup suggests that XRP’s weakness is more a function of fading demand than heavy distribution. Sellers do not appear to be flooding exchanges, even as price trends lower. This distinction matters for assessing downside risk. With XRP reserves now at their lowest level since 2024, the market may be building a more supportive base. If buying momentum returns, reduced exchange supply will amplify price reactions, triggering faster and more pronounced moves than periods of high reserves. XRP Tests Long-Term Support As Bearish Structure Persists XRP price continues to trade in a clearly weakened structure, with the chart highlighting a prolonged corrective phase following the sharp rejection from the $3.60–$3.70 highs. After peaking in late summer, XRP entered a steady downtrend marked by lower highs and persistent selling pressure, eventually breaking below the $2.00 psychological level. This breakdown shifted market structure decisively in favor of bears and accelerated the move toward the current $1.85–$1.90 zone. From a technical perspective, XRP is trading below its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which have rolled over and are now acting as dynamic resistance. The 200-day moving average, currently rising near the $1.75–$1.80 region, has become the most critical level to monitor. Related Reading: Why $100,000 Is Bitcoin’s Most Important Resistance Level Price is hovering just above this long-term support, suggesting that selling pressure is slowing but not yet fully exhausted. At the same time, declining volume during recent sessions points to reduced participation rather than clear accumulation. As long as XRP fails to reclaim the $2.10–$2.20 range, downside risks remain elevated. A decisive breakdown below the 200-day moving average would likely open the door to a deeper correction toward the $1.60 area. On the upside, bulls would need a strong reclaim of $2.00 followed by acceptance above short-term moving averages to signal a meaningful trend reversal.
