    "title": "Reasons Why XRP’s Technical Structure Favors Upside Than Down Over Next 6 Months",
    "body": "XRP’s recent pullback to $2 has not changed the broader technical picture, according to a new analysis shared on X by crypto analyst Egrag Crypto. Despite the lack of bullish price action in recent weeks, the technical analysis proposes that the market structure continues to favor an upside continuation rather than the trend ending. This outlook places the next three to six months in a constructive zone for XRP’s price action, where the probability of further upside is higher than the risk of a downward move. Related Reading: Do Kwon Falls Hard — Terraform Labs Chief Gets 15 Years For Wire Fraud XRP Currently In Consolidation, Not Distribution The assessment of Egrag’s technical analysis is based on XRP’s price action currently ticking a list of boxes that points to the next move being up. The first of these boxes is what the analyst referred to as a regime shift, which occurred after the XRP price made a decisive breakout from a multi-year base around $0.5 last year. This decisive breakout shifted the market from accumulation to expansion. Pullbacks in this phase are usually corrective, not trend-ending. In that context, the current price action can be viewed as part of a natural pause rather than a signal that the larger bullish move has failed. Another central argument in the analysis is that the current price behavior represents consolidation rather than distribution. Egrag Crypto describes the market as being in a compression phase following an impulse, and this is a pause, not a top. Although XRP has spent about 13 months ranging within this structure, the analyst interpreted this as extended consolidation instead of a distribution process. Chart Image From X. Source: @egragcrypto On X EMA Structure Keeps Bullish Bias Intact Another reason as to why the trend is more likely bullish is because XRP is still trading in alignment with its long-term exponential moving average, which remains above the 21 EMA. That relationship preserves the bullish bias, even though price currently sits below the faster 9 EMA, but this only reflects short-term weakness rather than a structural breakdown. Beyond pure chart structure, fundamental developments have added weight to the case for longer-term appreciation. XRP is currently holding $2 as an important support zone, and recent developments have emerged that could increase bullish sentiment. An example is Ripple’s conditional approval alongside other crypto firms for a national trust bank charter from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Related Reading: Solana’s Long-Awaited Firedancer Launch Sparks 5% Rally Although the outlook is much more bullish, there is always the possibility of turning bearish within the next six months. According to Egrag, this outlook can only turn bearish if XRP records a sustained monthly close below the $1.80 to $1.60 region. Taken together, the analysis concludes that XRP is more likely to resolve higher than lower over the next three to six months, even if there is price volatility along the way.

    "title": "Bitcoin And Ethereum Market Structure Points To Crypto Winter – Details",
    "body": "The crypto market has shown a modest price rebound in the last three weeks, returning to a total market cap of $3.07 trillion. During this time, Bitcoin has climbed by 11% from its local bottom at $80,700, while Ethereum has been more aggressive, gaining by 18% within the same period. Despite these reassuring performances, a market analyst with the username PelinayPA postulates that the bear market has commenced, considering certain technical parameters. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Structure Weakens As Inter-Exchange Liquidity Touches Red Zone – Details BTC & ETH Moving Averages, Trading Volumes Signal Bear Season Bear market speculations have been at a heightened level in Q4 2025, as the crypto market suffered extensive price corrections, during which Bitcoin alone retraced by around 36.5%. While the market may have shown some steady upward mobility in recent weeks, many analysts remain convinced the bears have assumed market control, leaving little bullish potential for a full market reversal. In analyzing Bitcoin’s chart, PelinayPA explains that price is presently trading below the short (7, 14), medium (30, 50), and long-term moving averages (100), indicating a strong sellers’ dominance in the market. However, the more concerning observation is that these averages are sloping downward, suggesting the recent downtrend or corrections may not be temporary. Furthermore, the seasoned crypto analyst notes these moving averages are acting as resistance in classic bear-market behavior that initiates a selling spree upon contact with price. In addition, sellers are also aggressive as red candles come with higher volume, while hesitant buyers load the green candles with relatively lower volumes. Based on these technical observations, PelinayPA explains that Bitcoin is not launching a bullish market reversal, but rather remains in a reaction within a larger bear market. Meanwhile, the Ethereum market analysis shows a similar situation in that price is trading below key moving averages. However, the short-term MAs (7, 14) are beginning to turn upward. In addition, the price rebounds from lows are stable and stronger while candles are recording shorter wicks, indicating the selling pressure is less aggressive, why buying interest remains visible. Therefore, while Ethereum is clearly stronger than Bitcoin, the bullish strength remains insufficient to initiate a trend reversal as long-term MAs remain downward sloping amid low buying volume. Related Reading: If This Ethereum Bear Flag Pattern Holds, ETH Price Could Be On Its Way To $2,400 Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $90,155 after a minor 0.22% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, daily trading volume is down by 20.34% and valued at $64.22 billion. According to PelinayPA, the Bitcoin bull rally is finished, and a deeper price correction is needed before investors see another parabolic surge or all-time high. The analyst predicts Bitcoin to bottom around $50,000 in the “ongoing” bear market, postulating a potential 44.4% decline from the present market prices.

    "title": "Ethereum Active Address Count Hits Seven-Month Low  — What This Means",
    "body": "While the Ethereum price still struggles to mount a sustained bullish momentum, an investigation into its on-chain activity has revealed a significant change in the behavior of its market participants. Active Addresses Decline To 327,000 From 483,000 August High In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, market analyst CryptoOnchain shared that there has been a growing scarcity of activity within the Ethereum network. Specifically, the quant referenced data obtained from the Ethereum Active Addresses metric, observed on the 7-day Simple Moving Average. Related Reading: If This Ethereum Bear Flag Pattern Holds, ETH Price Could Be On Its Way To $2,400 Since reaching its peak in August, the Active Addresses metric has declined steadily from about 483,000 to 327,000 — a level which marks the lowest reached since May this year. This downturn of more than 32% suggests an increasing exit of willing participants from the Ethereum network. Interestingly, the aforementioned downturn is not a stand-alone phenomenon. Just around the same period where active addresses explored the southside of the charts, the Ethereum price also took on a bearish direction. This period saw the Ether token lose its $4,800 valuation and begin its descent to the current price around $3,100. According to the analyst, this strong correlation between the falling Ethereum valuation and its contracting network usage points to something clear — that the recent price drop is likely a result of reduced network demand. This further shows that market participants are moving past speculation, and are in lieu adopting a broader outlook on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum Market Outlook On the more positive side, CryptoOnchain explained how healthy bull cycles differ from the present market cycle. Typically, rising prices are not taken for granted as they often indicate a healthy bullish cycle. An expansion of the cryptocurrency’s network usage also lends credence — enough to serve as confirmation — to suspicions of structural shifts into bullish phases. This theory holds true from a variety of historical occurrences. So, a market would not qualify as bullish enough if the Ethereum price were on the rise without any parallel growth in on-chain activity. Hence, for a convincing price reversal to hold, there has to be a significant and sustained recovery of active addresses. This would signal the return of on-chain demand and further heighten expectations of imminent momentum. Until those conditions are simultaneously met, the Ethereum market remains in a state of utmost caution, where prices could head towards either direction, with the major factor being the influx of network users. As of press time, the Ether token is valued at about $3,106, reflecting no significant movement since the past day.

    "body": "The Bitcoin market has continued to consolidate within the $90,000 price zone over the last day, reflecting a minor 0.04% gain within this period. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has witnessed a steady rally in recent weeks, forming the early phases of an ascending channel. To protect this potential uptrend, recent on-chain data shows that investors are moving to initiate a downside and price in the market effect of an anticipated negative catalyst. Related Reading: Bitcoin Macro Retracement Meets Mid-Range Battle – Will Bulls Reclaim Momentum? Bitcoin Sees High Inflows, Negative Funding Rates As Investors Guard Against Rate Hike In a QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, the crypto analysis page XWIN Research Japan discusses how potential Japan economic developments are presently impacting the Bitcoin market. Notably, analysts and economists expect the Bank of Japan to announce a 25 bps rate hike at its next policy meeting between December 18-19, as the Asian nation moves to end an ultra-loose monetary regime. Interest rate hikes are generally interpreted as bearish catalysts as they force investors to move out of risky assets due to less available capital, thereby inducing a price decline. According to XWIN Research Japan, Bitcoin investors may currently be attempting to absorb the resulting price pressure, potentially muting the immediate impact of the primary catalyst itself. This theory is based on multiple developments, such as exchange netflows. The analysts at XWIN report that exchange inflows are rising to mirror similar levels seen during previous BOJ hikes. Investors are presently exiting exchanges and minimizing their spot exposure to reduce the market impact of the expected decision. Meanwhile, the funding rates are also declining, another event seen during past rate hikes. Notably, investors are proactively losing their leverage in what is a pre-event caution movement.

At press time, Bitcoin tie valued at $90,190, reflecting a market gain of 0.77% in the past week. With the Bank of Japan’s hawkish pivot largely priced in, XWIN Research says that market focus has shifted away from the rate hike itself toward post-announcement yen dynamics. Going forward, the analysts explain that Bitcoin’s near-term direction may hinge on whether the yen continues to strengthen or if markets respond with a “sell the rumor, buy the fact” reversal, signaling that the adjustment phase is already unfolding.

    "title": "Ethereum Forms Wyckoff Breakout Setup: $10,000 Price Target Back In Focus",
    "body": "A recent technical analysis shared on X by crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader presents Ethereum’s price action on the 2-day candlestick chart as a textbook example of Wyckoff accumulation. In his assessment, Ethereum has already moved through several key stages of the model and is now approaching a powerful expansion phase, provided the structure stays intact. Related Reading: American Bitcoin Makes Big Buy, Adds 416 BTC To Its Stack Wyckoff Accumulation Structure Taking Shape On Ethereum Chart Over the past several days, Ethereum has traded between roughly $3,050 and $3,400, repeatedly failing to secure a sustained move beyond either boundary. At the time of writing, Ethereum’s price action is trading around $3,100. This prolonged standoff has reinforced the view that Ethereum has returned to consolidating rather than trading in a defined trend, a behavior that aligns closely with the accumulation phase highlighted in a technical analysis by Merlijn The Trader. In his post, Merlijn described Ethereum’s chart as a “Wyckoff masterclass,” pointing to a sequence of events that align with textbook behavior from the Wyckoff accumulation schematic, which have been playing out for the entirety of 2025. According to the annotated structure, the spring occurred when ETH briefly dipped below $1,500 in the first half of the year. Price did not linger below that level for long, reclaiming the range within days and going on a rally that eventually ended at a selling climax (SC) of $4,946 Within this structure, the initial selling climax and automatic downtrend reaction established a clear range in which the cryptocurrency has been trading up until now. The chart labels show this as Ethereum moving through Phase D, and this has been highlighted by a downtrend in recent months. However, based on the Wyckoff framework, Ethereum seems to now be approaching the breakout zone, with a transition into a full Phase E and a potential vertical markup coming next if the structure continues to play out. Phase E Projection Points To Strong Upside Scenario If the Wyckoff roadmap continues to unfold as outlined, Merlijn believes Ethereum is setting up for a full Phase E, the final stage of the accumulation process. This phase is characterized by a sustained markup, where price exits the selling climax (SC) decisively and trends higher with increasing momentum. Ethereum / US Dollar: @MerlijnTrader on X The projection on the chart shows a sharp upside expansion once overhead resistance is cleared, with Merlijn pointing to $10,000 and higher as a long-term objective if the structure completes. The path higher is not expected to be linear. The model anticipates an initial push into new all-time highs, followed by a modest rejection around the $5,000 area before the price pauses to consolidate towards the Backup and Last Point of Support Related Reading: Do Kwon Falls Hard — Terraform Labs Chief Gets 15 Years For Wire Fraud According to the chart, this BU/LPS would likely form around $3,750. If Ethereum holds above that level during the pullback, it would confirm structural strength, with the subsequent expansion targeting above $10,000.

    "title": "Bitcoin Headed For $200 Trillion? CEO Makes Bold Prediction",
    "body": "A new public company with a big Bitcoin stash is pitching a bold claim. Twenty One Capital, which listed on the New York Stock Exchange on December 9, arrived with close to $4 billion Bitcoin treasury and now holds the third-largest BTC reserve among public firms. According to the firm’s CEO, Jack Mallers, Bitcoin’s role could expand far beyond a speculative holding. Related Reading: Solana’s Long-Awaited Firedancer Launch Sparks 5% Rally CEO Sees Bitcoin As A Reserve Asset Mallers told viewers on theCUBE+NYSE Wired that Bitcoin has compounded holders’ portfolios at roughly 50% a year over the past five to 10 years. Based on reports, he expects that the current $2 trillion market for Bitcoin could grow to between $20 trillion and $200 trillion. He argued Bitcoin might become the next global reserve asset as finance “recollateralizes” itself away from traditional treasuries and government debt. If supply then stood at 20 million tokens when a 100x market rise happened, Bitcoin would trade near $10 million per coin. At a present price of $92,270, that outcome would equal an increase of about 10,730%. Market Signals Remain Mixed Short-term market signs are not all in favor of a big rally. According to market watchers, the Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut barely moved Bitcoin, leaving price action largely flat and directionless. The MACD histogram, however, is showing hints of bullish momentum in some technical reads, which suggests buyers may be warming up. The dollar index is showing signs of weakness, which often helps assets like Bitcoin. ETF flows keep disappointing. Without steady inflows from funds, big narratives can struggle to turn into lasting price gains. Product Push Aimed At Liquidity Without Selling Twenty One Capital says it wants to offer services that let holders tap liquidity without selling their coins. The firm plans to start in credit and lending and has said it will roll out products in partnership with Tether. Related Reading: Do Kwon Falls Hard — Terraform Labs Chief Gets 15 Years For Wire Fraud Mallers described the company as more than a balance-sheet accumulator; he compared their ambitions to Coinbase while stressing a narrower focus on Bitcoin services. If executed, these offerings could change how holders manage risk and cash needs. Big Numbers And Big Questions The projection to $200 trillion is headline-grabbing. It is a vision, not a forecast, and it hinges on major shifts in global finance and adoption. Reports note that other industry figures have offered similar long-term targets, which means the idea is not unique but remains highly debated. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "XRP Holders Labeled ‘Uneducated Perma Bulls’ By Veteran Trader – Details",
    "body": "Veteran market trader Peter Brandt has reignited debate around XRP after issuing sharp remarks about the token’s most loyal supporters. Drawing from a career that spans more than five decades, Brandt grouped XRP alongside silver when describing markets where bullish belief often holds firm despite repeated price swings and long periods of disappointment. Related Reading: Do Kwon Falls Hard — Terraform Labs Chief Gets 15 Years For Wire Fraud According to people familiar with his comments, Brandt grounded his criticism in personal trading history. He said he has handled thousands of contracts across commodities, equity benchmarks, and digital assets, and argued that the “perma bulls who I find most uneducated and biased are those who trumpet Silver and XRP,” pointing to what he sees as a pattern of investors staying bullish even when price action and broader conditions turn against them. Brandt Highlights Decades Of Experience Brandt’s tone was blunt and personal. He has a long record of public commentary, and his criticisms of XRP are part of a pattern that stretches back years. Earlier this month he called XRP supporters “obsessed” and compared their conviction to that of silver bulls. For 50 years I have traded many thousands of contracts of every commodity, stock indexes and as many cryptos as you can think of The perma bulls who I find most uneducated and biased are those who trumpet Silver and XRP — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 12, 2025 At times he has made bearish forecasts — including predictions that XRP would slide toward zero against Bitcoin — while at other moments he identified bullish chart patterns and set higher targets that were later hit before the market reversed. Community Pushback And Surprises Responses came fast. Zach Rector, a known figure in the XRP space, pushed back on Brandt’s view. Reports disclosed that Bitcoin maximalist YoungHoon Kim said on December 12 that he would start buying XRP — a notable shift for someone who had favored Bitcoin exclusively. Kim has claimed an IQ of 276, a detail many readers flagged as unverifiable, but it was repeated in social posts and prompted discussion. X Finance Bull accepted Brandt’s trading record but suggested that charts alone may miss broader structural moves in crypto markets. Dr. Don Woods, a self-described silver bull, joked that triple-digit returns had left him unbothered by labels of bias or ignorance. XRP: Price Context And Market Moves According to market snapshots tied to the exchanges, XRP traded above $3 at one point before slipping toward the lower end of the $2 region. Volume and broader crypto swings played parts in that move. Brandt’s critics point to that resilience as proof his calls are sometimes off. His supporters say his track record over five decades still deserves weight. Both views are in circulation, and both are being used to argue different investment cases. 10,000 XRP And The Freedom Argument Meanwhile, Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has kept a steady bullish stance. Based on his past posts, he argued that holding 10,000 XRP could put an investor in a special position if prices rise enough. Related Reading: American Bitcoin Makes Big Buy, Adds 416 BTC To Its Stack “It’s hard to understand how free you’ll be,” he wrote in one message that was later shared widely. That claim contains no timeline or clear price targets. It is a conviction play, not a forecast built from disclosed assumptions. The differing views is part of a wider debate about bias, data, and belief in crypto. Some traders treat Brandt’s words as a warning against unchecked optimism. Others treat community pushback as evidence that XRP’s story is not settled and that broader factors — legal, regulatory, and adoption-related — could change the math.

There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.020 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below $1.950. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price attempted a recovery wave above $2.120 but failed to continue higher, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price started a fresh decline below $2.050 and $2.020. There was a move below the $2.00 support level. A low was formed at $1.9525, and the price recently started an upside correction. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.047 swing high to the $1.952 low. However, the bears are active near $2.00 and $2.020. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.020 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.00 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The first major resistance is near the $2.020 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.047 swing high to the $1.952 low. A close above $2.020 could send the price to $2.050. The next hurdle sits at $2.080. A clear move above the $2.120 resistance might send the price toward the $2.150 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.20 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.250. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.020 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.9650 level. The next major support is near the $1.950 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.950 level, the price might continue to decline toward $1.920. The next major support sits near the $1.880 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.820.
