    "title": "SEC Chair Sets Out Plans For Crypto Taxonomy To Define Digital Asset Classification",
    "body": "In recent statements made by Chair Paul Atkins, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced a strategic plan targeted at giving much-needed clarity on the classification of crypto assets. Howey Test And Token Taxonomy In Crypto Atkins highlighted the forthcoming consideration of establishing a “token taxonomy” within the Commission, a structured framework rooted in legal rationale to discern between securities and commodities. He emphasized the importance of adhering to “limiting principles” in laws and regulations to ensure a cohesive approach towards crypto asset classification. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Bottom Out In 300 Days: Top Expert Forecasts $38,000 To $50,000 Price Point Atkins commended the efforts of Commissioner Hester Peirce, particularly her work in providing a transparent and economically grounded treatment of crypto assets under federal securities laws. The Chair emphasized three key themes in his address: the significance of a clear token taxonomy, the application of the Howey test in recognizing the temporary nature of investment contracts, and the practical implications for innovators, intermediaries, and investors in the evolving crypto landscape. Addressing the prevalent issue of distinguishing between securities and non-securities in the crypto space, Atkins noted that while most tokens are not inherently securities, certain tokens may have been sold within the context of an investment contract during a securities offering. However, he refuted the notion that every token involved in an investment contract perpetually retains its security status, emphasizing the importance of contextual analysis and recognizing the dynamic nature of investment contracts. Atkins Pledges Support For Evolving Digital Asset Laws In his remarks, Atkins also underscored the challenges faced by developers, exchanges, custodians, and investors in navigating the crypto ecosystem, where tokens serve various functions beyond traditional securities. He criticized the previous administration’s “blanket treatment” of all tokens as securities, highlighting the need for a more nuanced and practical approach to regulation to prevent stifling innovation and driving it offshore. Related Reading: China’s Cybersecurity Agency Alleges US Government Stole $13 Billion In Bitcoin In alignment with ongoing legislative efforts, Atkins reassured that the SEC aims to complement, rather than replace, existing crypto legislative initiatives. He emphasized the agency’s commitment to robust fraud enforcement and the development of clearer regulatory guidelines to ensure the safety of US investors. In closing, Atkins emphasized the importance of forward-looking regulatory practices, rejecting a stagnant approach rooted in fear of change. He reiterated the SEC’s commitment to delineating clear boundaries and providing transparent guidance. The statement concluded: That is what Project Crypto is about. That is what the Commission should be about. And that is the commitment I make to you today as Chairman: we will not let fear of the future trap us in the past.

    "body": "Following the recent comeback of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, Cypherpunk Technologies has launched a $50 million Zcash (ZEC) treasury strategy backed by Winklevoss Capital. Related Reading: SUI Eyes Key Retest As Price Breaks Out Of Downtrend – Rally To $3 Ahead? Cypherpunk Technologies Launches Zcash DAT On Wednesday, Leap Therapeutics announced the official launch of its Zcash Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) strategy and rebrand to Cypherpunk Technologies. The biotech company previously revealed that it had closed a $58.88 million private placement in October, led by Winklevoss Capital, as part of its plan to expand to the digital assets sector. The company currently holds 1.25% of the current ZEC supply after acquiring 203,775 ZEC at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $50 million, or $245.37 per token. Cypherpunk Technologies will reportedly continue to accumulate Zcash to own at least 5% of the total ZEC supply. The Company believes that privacy-protecting assets and related technologies will be critical in an increasingly digital world. The Company intends to acquire and hold ZEC, the native coin of Zcash, as its primary digital asset and to be an active participant in the Zcash community. Douglas E. Onsi, President and CEO of Cypherpunk Technologies, asserted that “This past month has been transformative for the Company, marked by closing a $58.88 million private placement led by Winklevoss Capital and successfully deploying $50 million to build a digital asset treasury designed to create long-term shareholder value focused on active participation in the development of Zcash and acquiring ZEC.” Per the announcement, the company will begin trading on Nasdaq under the new CYPH ticker on Thursday, November 13. Meanwhile, its ongoing cancer research and development operations will continue under a subsidiary that will take the Leap Therapeutics name. Winklevoss Twins Back ‘Encrypted Bitcoin’ In an X post, Gemini’s co-founder, Tyler Winklevoss, explained the reasons behind Winklevoss Capital’s investment in Cypherpunk Technologies, emphasizing the importance of supporting privacy and self-sovereignty in the online era. “Privacy is the precondition for many of our freedoms. It’s the point at which government and corporate reach end and our individual freedoms and self-sovereignty begin. As our lives have moved online, privacy’s become a rare, vanishing commodity,” the post reads. Winklevoss highlighted Zcash’s “highly symbiotic relationship” with Bitcoin since its launch nine years ago, affirming that, “If bitcoin is digital gold, Zcash is encrypted bitcoin, or digital cash.” One is your store of value, the other is how you privately move your value. We’ve been tracking this symbiosis for years and believe that now — as we enter the age of AI — is the right time to begin accumulating ZEC. Gemini’s co-founder also argued that Zcash could capture “a meaningful percentage” of BTC’s market capitalization, which he has predicted will surge to $1 million per BTC over the next 5-10years. Therefore, he believes that “Zcash will appreciate significantly from here as well.” Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Reclaims $3,500 Amid Market Rebound, Analysts Forecast December Take-Off It’s worth noting that Zcash has recorded a parabolic rally since September, surging 1,775% to its all-time high (ATH) of $750 last Friday. Since then, the cryptocurrency has followed the market’s correction, dropping over 40% to the $420 area before recovering. As of this writing, Zcash is trading at $507, a 15% increase in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "United States President Donald Trump late Wednesday signed legislation that ended the country’s 43-day government shutdown, reopening federal agencies and restarting paused services after what had become the longest shutdown in modern history. Reports have disclosed the measure passed both houses this week and moves quickly to restore pay and services. Related Reading: Dogecoin Alert! Price Could Explode Over 2,800%, Analyst Says Funding Push Restores Pay And Services According to official House materials, the measure passed the House by a 222–209 vote and carries continuing appropriations that fund agencies through January 30, 2026. The bill covers several full-year appropriations and aims to return back pay to hundreds of thousands of federal workers who were furloughed or forced to work without pay. President Trump signs bill to OFFICIALLY reopen the government, ending the Democrat Shutdown. Let’s get our country WORKING again. 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/QJqX90k9sC — The White House (@WhiteHouse) November 13, 2025 Markets Liked The Certainty Risk assets jumped as lawmakers moved to end the standoff. Reports have disclosed Bitcoin climbed back toward the $105,000 area after the breakthrough, while broader crypto tokens also showed gains as traders priced in the reduction of fiscal uncertainty. Short, sharp moves in the market reflected traders unwinding defensive positions. Crypto Reaction In Numbers Bitcoin rose from lows near $99,300 earlier in the week to above $105,000 on news of progress, a move that some outlets measured as a roughly 6.7% uptick over recent sessions. Ethereum recovered toward about $3,600 as investors rotated back into riskier assets. These moves came alongside rallies in stocks and other risk markets. Based on reports from market commentators, the end of the shutdown reduced one layer of macro uncertainty. That made it easier for large funds and ETFs to move money without the risk of sudden policy disruption. Some short-term flows into crypto appear tied to renewed confidence that key infrastructure — like air travel and federal programs — will run normally again. Political Fallout And Next Steps Lawmakers from both parties have already signaled new fights ahead, with pressure to address policy items that were left out of the funding package. The White House framed the outcome as a win for governance, while critics said parts of the deal leave important programs and protections unresolved. Related Reading: XRP Has Held Its Ground As Most Altcoins Fall, Market Observers Say Market Watchers Offer Caution While the immediate market reaction was positive, several analysts warned that gains tied to the shutdown’s end could be temporary. Volatility may return if political gridlock reemerges or if technical resistance levels hold for major tokens. The buying seen on the reopening was broad, but not unanimous, and many traders are watching whether flows remain steady into year-end. Featured image from ABC News, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "Memecoin POPCAT experienced a significant downturn on Wednesday following a major manipulation event on Hyperliquid (HYPE), one of the leading decentralized exchanges in the cryptocurrency market. POPCAT Faces 43% Drop Following Manipulative Scheme According to a detailed analysis of the situation by DeFi researcher Hanzo on social media site X (previously Twitter), an unknown trader executed a well-coordinated strategy approximately 13 hours prior to the market disruption. The trader withdrew $3 million in USDC from the OKX exchange and distributed the funds across 19 different wallets on Hyperliquid. Subsequently, they initiated sizable long positions on POPCAT, accumulating total exposure estimated between $20 million and $30 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Bottom Out In 300 Days: Top Expert Forecasts $38,000 To $50,000 Price Point To create an illusion of demand for the memecoin, the trader placed a massive buy wall at the price point of $0.21, with orders totaling $30 million lined up on the order book. This artificial façade of high buying interest successfully attracted real traders, prompting them to jump on the bandwagon and increase their own buying activity. However, the situation took a swift turn when the trader removed the buy wall without warning, leading to an instantaneous collapse in the price of POPCAT. This shift resulted in the liquidation of all the long positions taken by traders. The unknown trader lost their $3 million collateral, while Hyperliquid’s HLP system automatically absorbed the open positions. This action triggered an additional loss of approximately $4.9 million to the HLP, exacerbating a broader market selloff across the token. Hyperliquid Faces Third Major Disruption This Year In the wake of the incident, the Hyperliquid team took emergency measures to stabilize the market and close any remaining exposures. Shortly after, the platform paused its Arbitrum (ARB) bridge, although it continued processing deposits and withdrawals normally. The community has expressed skepticism regarding the circumstances surrounding this incident, with many suggesting it may not have been a random liquidation. Instead, some believe the event could resemble a deliberate stress test or an attack aimed at destabilizing Hyperliquid’s liquidity system. Some contend that the rapid loss of millions in such a short time frame seems too calculated to be merely coincidental. Related Reading: China’s Cybersecurity Agency Alleges US Government Stole $13 Billion In Bitcoin This incident marks the third major market disruption on Hyperliquid in 2025, raising serious questions about the exchange’s approach to handling liquidity concentration and its systemic risk management practices, as noted by Hanzo in his analysis. Following the manipulation, the POPCAT memecoin saw a steep decline of approximately 43%, dropping from $0.21 to $0.12, with total liquidations reaching around $63 million. The decentralized exchange’s native token, HYPE, also declined significantly following the event. According to CoinGecko data, it is currently trading at $38.25, which is a 7% decrease on the weekly timeframe. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "The Shiba Inu price and its trajectory over the last few months have been a source of growing concerns for SHIB investors as the meme coin has failed to secure any meaningful recovery. Despite the Bitcoin price rallying, Shiba Inu has remained quite muted, failing to reach new all-time highs through the bull rally. Therefore, with only two months left in the year 2025, the question remains as to whether the Shiba Inu price can still rally to new all-time highs. Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Shiba Inu Price Trajectory The machine learning algorithm at the Coincodex website has shown a trajectory for the Shiba Inu price that suggests that the meme coin is destined for more sideways action this year. The prediction for the new year is that the meme coin will continue to trade in a very tight range. Related Reading: Institutions Have Been Buying Solana Every Day For 2 Weeks, Is $300 Possible? Even with the Shiba Inu price currently trending more than 88% below its all-time high from 2021, the machine learning algorithm does not see it bouncing anytime soon. For the rest of the year, the cryptocurrency is expected to trade under $0.000012. This puts it in the tight range of $0.00001-$0.000012. Interestingly, though, the same way the machine learning algorithm has predicted no increase, there is no expectation of a decline. The trajectory of the SHIB price over the next two months shows an almost straight line, and then continues into the year 2026 in the same manner. When Will SHIB Hit New All-Time Highs? According to the machine learning algorithm, SHIB investors awaiting the meme coin to hit a new all-time high have a long wait ahead of them. The long-term prediction suggests that the Shiba Inu price will not hit a new all-time high in the next decade. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Rally Above $0.74 ATHs In The Works As HTF Trend Holds This long-term prediction moves through the next three decades, going all the way into the year 2050, and yet Sh. For most of the time, the algorithm suggests that the cryptocurrency will only see double-digit growth for each year over the next couple of years. Interestingly, historical data also support muted performance for the Shiba Inu price for the rest of the year. CryptoRank website shows an average return of 0.31% for SHIB for the month of November and -9.84% for the month of December. If these hold, then it means that the SHIB price is more likely to decline than recover as the year moves toward an end. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Best Altcoins to Watch as Solana Whales Start Buying",
    "body": "What to Know: Solana’s order books show renewed whale demand while spot $SOL ETFs log a multi-day inflow streak, reinforcing risk appetite. SoFi’s crypto rollout adds a mainstream on-ramp for US retail, a structural tailwind for altcoin participation. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), Best Wallet Token ($BEST), and SPX6900 ($SPX) align with throughput, utility, and liquidity narratives that typically lead early in rotations. Solana just lit up the order books. Fresh ‘smart money’ buy walls and block-sized prints show whales leaning in, with net spot inflows building across top venues. The flow tells a simple story: big players are scaling bids into weakness and front-running a potential trend shift. The backdrop helps. Spot Solana ETFs have now chalked up 10 straight days of net inflows , a rare streak during a choppy week for majors. That run, led by Bitwise’s $SOL fund, pushes the narrative toward persistent demand and strengthens the case for an alt rotation if risk stabilizes. Retail rails are opening too. SoFi Bank has rolled out in-app crypto trading to its millions of customers, becoming the first nationally chartered US bank to offer crypto buying and selling – with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana at the forefront. Easier fiat on-ramps plus ETF flows and whale accumulation is the kind of three-piece puzzle that often precedes a broader alt rally. With that macro tailwind in mind, three tokens stand out due to their fundamentals and timing – two presales riding clear narratives and one listed memecoin with heavyweight liquidity. It’s a focused watchlist for anyone scouting the best altcoins to watch into the year-end. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – BTC L2 Built With SVM Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) takes a direct swing at the oldest pain point in crypto: slow and expensive $BTC transactions that negatively impact the ecosystem’s scalability. The design funnels transactions to a Bitcoin-settled Layer 2 and uses the Solana Virtual Machine for high throughput execution. The result aims for near-instant finality, ZK-assisted validity, and periodic L1 commitments to keep security anchored to Bitcoin. That’s serious design space for payments, dApps and even meme coins, with $BTC as the settlement bedrock. If $SOL ETF inflows are a proxy for demand for high-speed chains, then a Bitcoin-secured L2 using SVM could capture overflow interest from developers and traders looking for $BTC-native performance. Timing and numbers matter in presales. The token is priced at $0.013265 with the presale sitting at $26.99M raised. Based on the presale’s performance and Hyper’s utility proposition, a realistic price prediction for $HYPER puts it at $0.08625 by the end of 2026 and $0.253 by 2030. From today’s prices, these numbers translate into an ROI of 550% and 1,807% respectively. Given that Hyper targets a Q4 2025 – Q1 2026 release window, the earlier you join the $HYPER train, the better. Make sure you read our guide on how to buy $HYPER first. Visit the official presale page and buy your $HYPER today. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Utility-First Wallet Ecosystem Token $BEST is the native token for Best Wallet , a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet aiming to turn power-user features into default settings. Think cross-chain swaps via an autorouter across 300+ DEXs and 30 bridges, MPC security without seed phrases, real-world spending with the upcoming crypto card, and a token launchpad baked into the app. The token links to fee reductions, access, and ecosystem rewards across features that already map to daily crypto usage. Presale mechanics are straightforward. The token is live at $0.025935 with more than $17M raised. Our price prediction for $BEST outlines a potential 2026 high near $0.05106175, representing 96% gains. For a wallet token, utility density is the tell – on-ramp integrations, multi-chain coverage, and soon, in-app staking partners build a clear reason to hold through volatility. The tie-in to today’s flow: SoFi’s crypto rollout and $SOL ETF traction could nudge casual users to seek simple, secure self-custody with swap and bridge UX done right. $BEST plugs that gap natively. If you want in, make sure you read our guide on how to buy $BEST first. Then visit the presale page and buy your $BEST today. 3. SPX6900 ($SPX) – Meme Liquidity With Big-Cap Exchange Reach SPX6900 ($SPX) is a culture-driven meme asset with multi-chain reach and a simple message: internet-scale community meets exchange-grade liquidity. The token’s market cap sits above $615M, with $SPX sitting at $0.6609. As attention rotates, high-beta meme names with deep order books often act as liquidity barometers. They move first, they move fast, and they draw flow. Crucially, $SPX trades on Coinbase , which tends to boost retail access and tightens spreads for US users. That exchange reach matters when volatility returns and users want instant fills on familiar apps. Recent Coinbase pages and converters reflect live SPX markets and volumes on the platform, while aggregators show additional venues and pairs. If ETF and banking rails keep onboarding newcomers, liquid memes like $SPX can catch outsized bursts. And talking about bursts, $SPX showcases an all-time ROI of 25M%, which is literally a wealth-building performance. So, go to your favorite exchange and buy your $SPX today. Recap: Whales are scaling into $SOL, spot ETFs keep stacking inflows, and SoFi’s launch opens a bank-grade retail door. In that setup, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , and SPX6900 ($SPX) each tap a live narrative – $BTC-secured speed, wallet-centric utility, and meme liquidity with top exchange access.

    "title": "Next Crypto to Explode? Bitcoin Hyper Could Change Bitcoin with L2 Tech",
    "body": "What to Know: Bitcoin’s constraints on throughput and programmability cap mainstream utility. A performant L2 with Bitcoin settlement is the logical unlock. Bitcoin Hyper pairs SVM-speed execution with ZK-verified settlement on Bitcoin, targeting fast, low-cost transactions and DeFi. The $HYPER presale is nearing $27M raised, signaling strong interest ahead of mainnet milestones and initial listings. Using the current $0.013265 price, our forecast for $HYPER goes to a 1.9x high in 2025 and 6.5x in 2026 if roadmaps land. Bitcoin still moves like a freight train: unstoppable over distance, painfully slow up close. Block space is scarce, fees spike when demand pops, and native programmability is minimal. That leaves everyday payments clunky and DeFi on Bitcoin mostly stitched together with workarounds. Those constraints are tolerable for a store-of-value narrative. They’re a drag on mainstream utility. For reference, Bitcoin ranks 22nd among the fastest blockchains by TPS, which is far below industry standards. Solana ranks second on the same list. Layer-2 solutions are the obvious release valve. Payment channels handle throughput but struggle with complex logic and liquidity routing. Sidechains help, then trade off security assumptions. The real unlock is an L2 that processes high-throughput transactions and settles back to L1 with strong guarantees. Builders get speed and programmability. Users get cheaper, near-instant finality without abandoning the Bitcoin security umbrella. This is the gap Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is trying to close. The project proposes an L2 architecture that batches transactions, uses zero-knowledge proofs for validity, and periodically commits state to Bitcoin. Execution rides on a Solana-style virtual machine for throughput, with a canonical bridge to move $BTC in and out trustlessly. If it ships as planned, the stack aims to make Bitcoin programmable at scale – fast payments, convenient on-chain trading with staking flows, and full DeFi rails tied back to $BTC. Macro doesn’t hurt either. With Bitcoin hovering near cycle highs this year and institutional demand sticky, anything that expands $BTC’s utility surface tends to catch flows. A credible L2 narrative aligned to Bitcoin’s brand strength has a shot at outsized attention. Bitcoin Hyper: Solana-Speed Execution Meets Bitcoin-Grade Settlement Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) blueprint starts with a canonical bridge that verifies Bitcoin block headers and transaction proofs, then mints equivalent assets on the L2. The execution layer uses an SVM-compatible environment to push throughput while fees stay low. Hyper batches transactions, proven with ZK cryptography, and anchors the resulting state roots to Bitcoin for settlement. Withdrawals reverse the path and release $BTC on L1 after proof validation. The design targets three user wins: speed, cost, and programmability – without straying from Bitcoin’s security philosophy. If executed, this architecture invites real apps. Payments clear in seconds. Orderbooks and automated market markers operate without gas anxiety. Yield farming and structured products become feasible for $BTC holders who never wanted to leave the Bitcoin orbit. Developer momentum matters here: an SVM toolchain lowers friction for teams already fluent in that ecosystem, while $BTC settlement keeps the conservative crowd onside. That mix – familiar dev experience plus Bitcoin trust – is the project’s most pragmatic wedge. Competition exists. Lightning remains the OG for peer-to-peer payments. Other Bitcoin-adjacent stacks chase programmability with different compromises. But none of them offer the comprehensive solution that Hyper confidently pitches. Thinking about joining the ecosystem? Learn more about what Bitcoin Hyper does . Bitcoin Hyper is cleaner: keep settlement on Bitcoin, use a high-throughput Solana VM for execution, and prove correctness before committing. In a market where latency and user costs decide winners, that’s a sensible bet. Visit $HYPER’s website for more. Hyper’s Presale Economics and Realistic Upside Potential Momentum is there. The $HYPER presale is now at $26.99M, supported by a run of larger buys as the cycle grinds higher. That’s sizable traction for an early-stage L2 with a technical roadmap and a clear narrative tied to Bitcoin’s growth, which recommends $HYPER as one of the top crypto presales of 2025. The token price is now sitting at $0.013265 per $HYPER, with staking rewards at 43% . From that base, our price prediction for $HYPER maps two checkpoints: a potential 2025 high at $0.02595 if initial listings and early dApps land on schedule, and a 2026 high at $0.08625 if incentives and governance broaden participation. At today’s price, that implies 1.9x growth potential in late 2025 and 6.5x in 2026, respectively. Of course, crypto makes no guarantees. What could go wrong? Execution risk. Building a performant rollup and secure bridge on Bitcoin is not a trivial task. Other stacks chase the same mindshare. If $BTC chops for months, risk budgets thin across the board. Offsetting that, the thesis is simple: extend Bitcoin’s utility without diluting its core promise. If Bitcoin Hyper proves the tech and ships real apps, capital tends to follow utility. Hyper targets a Q4 2025-Q1 2026 listing window, so the presale train doesn’t have much fuel left. And based on the project’s value proposition and investor support, $HYPER could become the next crypto to explode in 2026. Get your $HYPER today. This isn’t financial advice.

    "title": "Taiwan Plans BTC Reserve Review — A Bullish Rally Signal For Bitcoin Hyper",
    "body": "What to Know: Taiwan is auditing $BTC exposure and assessing a reserve strategy, with a formal report due by end-2025. This marks a credible institutional tailwind for Bitcoin. Sovereign-level interest strengthens the ‘digital gold’ case and can add marginal demand, supportive for $BTC price and $BTC-native infrastructure. Bitcoin Hyper targets speed and programmability for $BTC via an SVM-based Layer-2, aiming to unlock faster payments, DeFi, and dApps within Bitcoin’s ecosystem. $HYPER’s presale price is $0.013265; a potential high of $0.08625 in 2026 could mean a +550% ROI if devs successfully hit project milestones. Taiwan plans to put Bitcoin on its policy map. Lawmakers have pushed for a full audit of the government’s $BTC exposure and a formal study into adding Bitcoin to national reserves. Premier Cho Jung-tai pledged a detailed Taiwan reserve-strategy report by year-end 2025 . That’s not a casual nod. It’s a signal that $BTC is graduating from ‘risk asset’ to potential sovereign-grade reserve. The motivation is simple enough: diversify a reserve stack still dominated by USD and add a liquid, hard-capped asset with global settlement. This decision comes after Taiwanese legislator Ju Chun Ko had framed Bitcoin as a ‘digital gold’ hedge to USD concentration back in a May 9 session, signalling political cover for a serious allocation debate. Today, Taiwan’s FX hoard sits in the hundreds of billions, totalling $602.94B (of which 90% is USD), as per the CBC . So, even a small allocation would be material on the margin. A proper audit also sweeps up seized coins held by agencies following legal cases — inventory that could seed a pilot treasury program instead of being dumped at auction. This policy change could cause a domino effect. One credible government exploring $BTC reserves tightens the supply narrative and reinforces the ‘digital gold’ idea – particularly in an environment where ETFs have already absorbed a steady flow. If the report lands on schedule and the door opens to a modest allocation, the market gets another demand vector. Projects building real utility around Bitcoin typically benefit first. That’s the plan for Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a $BTC-centric Layer-2 aiming to turn store-of-value into a spend-and-build ecosystem. Bitcoin Hyper Wants to Turn Bitcoin Into a High-Throughput DeFi Ecosystem Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is building a Layer-2 that uses the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for fast execution while anchoring finality to Bitcoin’s base layer. In plain English, this means: cheap, low-latency transactions and smart-contract capability without altering Bitcoin’s consensus. Imagine Solana-style speed and programmability on top of Bitcoin’s security – a combination that’s been missing in $BTC-native ecosystems. To make this happen, the project’s playbook includes a canonical bridge for wrapping $BTC for DeFi use on the Hyper side chain, then releasing the L1 $BTC back to your wallet on exit. Once the live net is up, this setup makes it possible to onboard tooling for payments, DeFi, and dApps. Security is also a dev priority, especially for the project’s financing rounds. External checks from Coinsult and SpyWolf have reviewed the $HYPER token contract and flagged no backdoors or mint functions, a non-negotiable baseline to ensure token scarcity and fair trading. That doesn’t guarantee crypto success, of course. But good security does reduce avoidable smart-contract risk at the token layer. If Taiwan’s review lifts Bitcoin mindshare and on-chain activity, networks that make $BTC usable sit in the slipstream. That’s the lane $HYPER wants to own with its cheap payments, DeFi compatibility, and quick confirmations. See Bitcoin Hyper’s ecosystem plans. $HYPER Token’s Presale Is in Full Swing with $27M+ Raised Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the utility crypto for the Hyper network. Now in presale, $HYPER has crossed $27M, with plans to set aside 75% of its funds to support project development, marketing, and a long-term treasury. The token is priced at $0.013265 right now, though its fundamentals leave room for upside once liquidity and listings arrive in Q4 2025/Q1 2026. According to our $HYPER token forecast , the token has a potential high of $0.02595 in 2025 and $0.08625 in 2026 if listing and live mainnet milestones land as planned. From the current presale price, those levels imply about +96% and +550% respectively — not the moonshot hype you’d see on Crypto Twitter, but grounded in real value and fundamentals. Put simply, if utility ships and Bitcoin stays bid, this type of multiple isn’t fantasy. The market context is certainly on Hyper’s side. Taiwan’s review timeline runs through 2025, overlapping with Bitcoin Hyper’s roadmap windows. A favorable government report won’t flip a switch on day one, yet it improves the macro narrative for $BTC-aligned infrastructure exactly when $HYPER aims to turn on throughput. If a sliver of sovereign-level demand materializes, the liquidity tide can lift the $BTC-centric stack, extending to bridges, wallets, and L2s that make $BTC actually usable. That’s where a fast SVM execution layer tied to Bitcoin’s settlement could capture real volumes instead of pure speculation. Join Bitcoin Hyper and get 43% APY.

    "title": "Best Crypto to Buy as Franklin Templeton Extends Benji to $6T Canton Network",
    "body": "What to Know: Canton’s $6T processed assets and $280B daily repo volumes show tokenization has graduated from pilots to real transaction flow. Franklin Templeton extending Benji to Canton tightens the loop between regulated funds, collateral networks, and on-chain settlement. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) targets Bitcoin’s biggest gap – throughput – while Best Wallet Token ($BEST) leans into UX; Stellar ($XLM) anchors cross-border payments with deep listings. For presale exposure, $HYPER offers higher beta to Layer-2 demand; $BEST ties to wallet utility; $XLM provides listed liquidity. Franklin Templeton just plugged its Benji tokenization stack into the Canton Network, the institution-first blockchain linking collateral, settlement, and regulated markets. The move expands Benji’s reach from public networks into Canton’s private, permissioned rails where banks and trading firms already exchange tokenized assets. It’s a small line in a press release, but a big nudge toward mainstream on-chain finance. This matters, because Canton has scaled beyond pilot theater. Applications on the network are handling more than $6T in tokenized assets and north of $280B in daily U.S. Treasury repo transactions, a scale that signals real throughput rather than slideware. If tokenization is the sticky bridge between TradFi and crypto, Canton is where that bridge is getting traffic – and Benji now sits on it. For investors, this is a credibility signal. Regulated fund shares moving on a network that already processes institutional collateral give tokenized money funds and RWA collateral a clearer route into trading workflows. 💡 That’s a tailwind for projects positioned around Bitcoin scalability, self-custody user experience, and cross-border payments – three narratives with actual users and obvious product-market fit. Through that lens, three names stand out today as the best crypto to buy now. Read on as we delve into Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST), both in presale, plus Stellar ($XLM) on the listed side. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin Layer-2 With Throughput Ambitions When regulated funds go on-chain, low-latency settlement and high-capacity rails stop being optional. Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) pitch is simple: bring Solana-style speed to Bitcoin via a Layer-2 that batches, executes, and settles back to the Layer-1. The presale broke the $27M milestone today, suggesting there’s real appetite for a throughput-first Bitcoin Layer-2 rather than just another meme coin with orange branding. $HYPER is currently priced at $0.013265 with 43% staking APY. ➡️ Check out our step-by-step guide to buying $HYPER. In simple words, Hyper relies on tools like the Solana Virtual Machine and a canonical bridge to make the Bitcoin ecosystem more scalable, cheaper, and more performant, which would qualify it for mainstream adoption. If the Benji-to-Canton momentum translates into higher institutional tolerance for on-chain collateral, Layer-2s enabling $BTC-adjacent activity benefit first. The near-term math checks out. 💰 Our price prediction for $HYPER suggests a potential 2026 high near $0.08625 as core roadmap items – initial dApps, listings, and a DAO – ship. From today’s $0.013265 presale price, that’s roughly ~6.5x to the 2026 high if execution stays on track. These stats alone recommend $HYPER as one of the best crypto to buy today. This isn’t a free lunch; delivery risk is real and competition across Bitcoin Layer-2s is heating up. But the asymmetry suits presale math, and the story aligns with the market’s push toward on-chain collateral and instant settlement. 🚀 Don’t delay – buy your $HYPER today. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Utility-First Wallet Token With Presale Traction Canton’s growth underscores a simple truth: the next wave of users will need better UX for multi-chain portfolios, bridging, and payments. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) centers that need. It’s the native asset for the self-custody Best Wallet app ecosystem that folds in a DEX, cross-chain swaps, and a card product. The presale has reached the 17M raised, with the token currently priced at $0.025935. That’s not froth; that’s users voting for utility and distribution. The Best Wallet ecosystem offers non-custodial services and plans to ‘capture 40% of the crypto wallet market share by the end of 2026’. The roadmap details the exact strategy at work, which involves milestones like 60+ chain support, a fiat offramp, and the Best Card, to name a few. 💰 Our price prediction for $BEST sees a potential end-2025 range topping around $0.035215 and a 2026 potential high near $0.05106175 if the roadmap lands – wallet growth, card rollout, and deeper integrations. From the current presale price, that’s ~36%–90% upside across the two years, with compounding utility rather than pure narrative carrying the lift. Yes, execution and listings timing matter. Still, with tokenized funds and RWAs normalizing, a wallet that abstracts network sprawl while offering real-world spend hooks is exactly what many newcomers will need. ➡️ Our guide to buying $BEST will help you navigate the purchase process. But hurry – the presale ends in two weeks. 🚀 Buy $BEST today and stake it for 77% APY while you still can. 3. Stellar ($XLM) – Payments Rail With Exchange Liquidity Today Stellar ($XLM) remains one of the most proven options for compliant cross-border transfers and fiat on-/off-ramps, now supported by Soroban smart contracts to widen its developer surface. Recent figures show $XLM at $0.2921 with a market cap above $9.3B, and the asset is broadly listed, including on Binance and Coinbase – meaning price discovery and liquidity are not theoretical. In a world where tokenized fund shares and repo collateral settle on permissioned chains, there’s still a huge role for public infrastructure that lets fintechs, remittance players, and stablecoin issuers move value across borders. ⚙️ Stellar’s blend of speed, low fees, and established exchange coverage keeps it relevant as the tokenization stack grows above it. Holders also get a clean story: payments first, programmability now, and plenty of listings to trade the cycle. With $XLM above $0.29 at the time of writing and an all-time ROI north of 9,677%, this one seems to be a banger. 🚀 Buy $XLM on Binance and other leading platforms today. Recap: Franklin Templeton’s Canton integration is the headline, but the subtext is bigger: regulated liquidity is moving on-chain at industrial scale. That is the connective tissue behind $HYPER’s Layer-2 throughput pitch, $BEST’s UX-led approach to self-custody, and $XLM’s liquid payments rail. If the question is the best crypto to buy into this tokenized-finance backdrop, these three sit squarely in the narrative with distinct roles and risk profiles.

    "title": "Popular Crypto Trader Reveals Why Bitcoin Price Is Still Crashing",
    "body": "Bitcoin is down by 2.1% in the past 24 hours, and its latest decline has come at a moment when many traders expected the opposite. The US government shutdown is already in the process of winding down after weeks of uncertainty, yet the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum have continued to drift lower and are under pressure. The cryptocurrency market’s inability to rebound notably has led to active debate among traders on X. One of the most vocal views came from a popular trader known as The White Whale, whose remarks express a growing sense of frustration across the crypto community. The Shutdown Isn’t Really Over The White Whale argument is that the crypto market’s price action is yet to rebound because the government shutdown is not truly over. The analyst insinuates that the apparent resolution to the shutdown is far less reassuring than it looks. Related Reading: Adam Beck’s Bitcoin Realization: What Kind Of Money Is BTC? In his view, the government only approved short-term funding so that federal workers get paid through the holiday period, but this leaves the underlying issue unresolved. The temporary nature of the fix means the same uncertainty could come back in just a few weeks, which he believes is preventing markets from reacting positively. The discussion attracted instant responses, including a contrasting view from another commentator, Nara Sumas. Sumas dismissed the idea that the shutdown is the main factor behind price action, noting that markets barely reacted when the shutdown began. The point is that the macro crypto environment is already heavy with weak sentiment, and there is bad news about the markets every day. Therefore, the crypto market’s decline has more to do with those structural conditions than with government drama. Furthermore, the brief uptick earlier in the week was due to exuberance and not anything based on fundamentals. Despite the pushback, The White Whale doubled down on his stance. He maintained that markets do react to shutdowns, but not immediately. Therefore, the delayed downturn is a reaction after it became apparent to investors that the situation wasn’t going to be resolved quickly. What’s Next For The Crypto Market? The path ahead for the crypto market is tied to whether confidence can return after weeks of choppy price action and sentiment. The exchange between traders on X, like the one highlighted above, shows that many are weighing the impact of the temporary government funding deal against the deeper macro issues that have shaped this downturn.

Even though the shutdown is winding down, the uncertainty around what happens next is notable, especially for investors who rely on clear policy direction before taking on additional risk. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,900, down by 2% in the past 24 hours. At the same time, XRP is witnessing a resurgence in interest, as investors are now awaiting the possible launch of a US-based Spot XRP ETF this week.

    "title": "Kyrgyzstan’s Gold-Backed Stablecoin Could Be Shining New Light on Best Wallet Token",
    "body": "What to Know: USDKG changes the usual stablecoin model by backing a dollar peg with real gold from Kyrgyzstan’s reserves. If gold and commodity stablecoins grow, users will want wallets that handle many stablecoins without turning their portfolio into a spreadsheet headache. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) gives real perks, like lower fees, early presale access, and smooth cross-chain swaps. Stablecoin liquidity drives the market, and wallet-layer tokens can collect lasting value from routing, discovery, and spending features. Think of them as the toll booths of the crypto highways. Kyrgyzstan surprised the stablecoin world with $USDKG, a gold-backed dollar coin that comes with a $50M first mint. It’s a different style in a market where most issuers rely on T-bills and repo. This launch is not just a flashy headline. It shows Kyrgyzstan wants more freedom in cross-border trade in a world full of sanctions and red tape. It also pushes the idea that dollar-pegged coins do not always need US financial plumbing behind them. $USDKG is pegged 1:1 to the dollar . Simple. But the backing is the twist. Gold replaces the usual short-term US assets. If USDKG becomes useful for settlement in Central Asia and nearby regions, we could see other countries and commodity exporters try non-Treasury collateral, too. It won’t shake the US.bond market tomorrow, but it does widen the design space for stablecoins. Think of it as switching from a single spice kitchen to a full spice rack. This shift brings wallets into the picture. People don’t change stablecoins alone – they change the tools they use. A wallet that handles swaps, cuts fees, and helps you find new assets becomes the winner. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is built for this moment. It offers a retail-friendly, non-custodial setup where the token has real utility inside the app. If gold-backed and commodity-linked stablecoins pick up speed, users will want wallets that make juggling multiple coins painless. That’s where $BEST fits. The token supports an ecosystem made for cross-chain swaps, presale access, and smoother on-off-ramp flows. Why Best Wallet Token ($BEST) Stands Out in the New Stablecoin Era When collateral changes, user habits change too. Gold backing means nothing if you can’t hold USDKG next to USDT, USDC, and your favorite RWA tokens without stress. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) focuses exactly on removing that stress. The Best Wallet app is non-custodial and multi-chain. It uses Fireblocks MPC security, so you stay in control while avoiding the classic seed phrase panic moment (we’ve all had that nightmare). Inside the app, a DEX aggregator pulls liquidity across some 300 chains and 30 bridges. You rebalance your assets with one tap instead of spending a week crying over gas fees, failed approvals, and mystery errors. $BEST shapes the economics of the wallet. Hold it, and you pay fewer fees. Swaps can get better terms when the network is busy. You also get early access to new tokens through the Upcoming Tokens portal. In a future where gold coins, sovereign coins, and tokenized Treasuries sit side by side, this curation layer becomes useful. You find new assets while staying inside one interface that already holds your $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, and standard stablecoins. Add portfolio tools, multiple wallet support, and anti-fraud features, and you end up with an app built for fast moves between new stablecoin rails and the wider crypto market. If USDKG and similar coins create new trade routes, the wallets that lower switching costs will capture users. It’s a smart time to check out the $BEST presale. The $BEST Presale and Why Timing Helps Wallet Tokens Macro forces help this story. Stablecoins already hold huge piles of T-bills and dominate on-chain liquidity. If some capital shifts toward gold-backed or commodity-linked models, that could expand stablecoin use cases rather than shrink them. In that world, wallet-layer tokens can capture a steady flow of fees and loyalty. The $BEST presale just passed the $17M mark, and you can buy $BEST for just $0.025935. The setup is simple: give the token real perks inside the app and reward people who use it. That includes reduced fees, early allocations, and higher engagement through staking. As cross-chain swaps and launchpad tools grow, the token becomes something you feel in daily use, not just a number on a dashboard. Holders get cheaper transactions, exclusive early access to trusted new projects before they launch publically, and a voice in which chains and features appear next. Demand is not imagined. It grows from an app that already solves basic user problems. At the current presale price, future listings and feature rollouts matter mainly through fee savings and access. That is a healthier angle in a market where narratives move quickly and every little transaction cost adds up. If you think stablecoins will keep diversifying and retail users will keep chasing easier tools, Best Wallet Token is one of the best crypto presales to invest in.

    "body": "According to market watchers, US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs posted a $520 million inflow on Tuesday, a sharp change after a mild $1.15 million inflow the day before and a recent week that saw $1.22 billion in withdrawals. Related Reading: XRP Has Held Its Ground As Most Altcoins Fall, Market Observers Say That swing in flows is being watched closely because inflows into ETFs have in the past helped drive big price climbs. Right now Bitcoin trades around $104,000, and some analysts say a jump toward $160,000–$170,000 is possible if buying pressure keeps building. Diminishing Golden Curves Hint At Lower Peaks Based on reports from CryptoCon, a model called diminishing golden curves maps price bands using logarithmic regression. The model tracks how far Bitcoin moves above a “Golden Curve” growth path and labels those moves with deviation levels. The next target for #Bitcoin is between $160,000 and $170,000 🚀 pic.twitter.com/QAd3RdDS8q — Bitcoin Teddy (@Bitcoin_Teddy) November 12, 2025 Past cycle tops landed at +5 in November 2013, +4 in December 2017, and +3 in November 2021. CryptoCon’s projection now places the next top near the +2 band, which translates to a range between $160,000 and $170,000, with a possible swing toward $186,000. If that plays out, Bitcoin would climb about 70% from current levels near $104,000. Halving Rhythm Still In Play Reports show the chart also uses halving-based sine waves. Since the last halving occurred in April 2024, the model expects a market peak in late 2025, a timing that matches the rough 12–18 month pattern seen after previous halvings. That rhythm has been a simple guide for many traders. It is not a guarantee, but it helps explain why analysts are paying attention to late 2025 as a possible climax point. Stablecoin And Exchange Reserves Add Weight On-chain signals add more detail. The stablecoin supply ratio has fallen to levels that historically lined up with market lows, suggesting there is dry powder waiting on the sidelines. Data from Binance shows stablecoin reserves rising while Bitcoin reserves on the exchange fall — a mix often read as accumulation by long-term holders. CryptoQuant analyst Moreno says liquidity is increasing and volatility is low, which can make the risk-reward seem attractive to buyers. Related Reading: Dogecoin Alert! Price Could Explode Over 2,800%, Analyst Says Timing And Risks Remain Important Market conditions could change quickly, Especially with new economic data and the end of the US government shutdown. That kind of macro event can add volatility and shift flows. Models like the Diminishing Golden Curves are useful tools, yet they depend on history repeating in ways that might not hold if a major shock appears.

    "body": "The XRP market just hit a historic milestone as the first U.S. spot XRP ETF, Canary Capital’s XRPC, officially debuts on Nasdaq, sending bullish shockwaves for the XRP price and other assets in the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Ready To Explode To $12,000 By January, Says Tom Lee The launch gives traditional investors direct exposure to XRP through regulated brokerage accounts, and analysts say this could be the spark that propels prices sharply higher in the coming weeks. XRP's price moving sideways on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview First Spot XRP ETF on Nasdaq Unlocks New Demand Nasdaq has certified the Canary Capital XRP ETF for trading under the ticker XRPC, making it the first fully spot-based XRP ETF in the U.S. The fund holds XRP directly and tracks the XRP-USD CCIXber Reference Rate Index, offering a simple, regulated way for institutions and retail investors to gain exposure without managing wallets or private keys. The ETF’s approval comes after the fund completed its Form 8-A filing with the SEC, clearing key regulatory hurdles. Other heavyweights, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, CoinShares, and 21Shares, also have XRP ETF applications in the pipeline, signaling a second wave of products that could further deepen liquidity and demand. On-chain data already shows shifting behavior ahead of the launch. Exchange inflows are down, suggesting holders are accumulating rather than selling, even as XRP trades around the $2.39–$2.50 zone and consolidates above support near $2.20–$2.40. Analysts See ‘Face-Melting’ XRP Price Rally as Technicals Coil Popular crypto analyst Egrag Crypto believes XRP is entering the final stages of a major consolidation that could lead to an explosive move within 4–6 weeks. Drawing on historical rallies in 2017 and 2021, he notes that XRP is once again forming a large symmetrical triangle, typically a “compression before expansion” structure. Using Fibonacci projections, Egrag highlights potential long-term targets between $10 and $37, while acknowledging that short-term market sentiment remains cautious. He argues that impatience and emotional selling often precede the biggest upside moves, and that today’s sideways action is more “preparation” than weakness. BlackRock Narrative and Macro Tailwinds Add Fuel Institutional narratives are also lining up behind XRP. At Swell 2025, BlackRock’s Maxwell Stein described the XRP Ledger as a scalable rail for trillions of dollars in tokenized assets and cross-border payments, reinforcing XRP’s status as a utility-driven asset rather than a purely speculative token. Related Reading: Bitcoin Death Cross Is Coming: Don’t Be Fooled By The Name With the Fed’s December rate decision approaching and risk appetite poised to shift, XRP now sits at the intersection of a powerful trio. Fresh ETF inflows, tightening technical patterns, and growing institutional validation. If these forces align, the XRPC launch may be remembered as the moment XRP’s next major rally truly began.

    "title": "Bitcoin Leverage Cooldown Signals Market Reset: OI Drops 21% As Excess Risk Is Flushed Out",
    "body": "Bitcoin continues to consolidate below the $105,000 mark, maintaining stability above the key $100,000 support level despite ongoing market uncertainty. Bulls appear to be losing momentum, yet sellers are showing signs of exhaustion as the price resists further decline. According to top analyst Darkfost, the market has entered a clear deleveraging phase following the major liquidation event on October 10 — a structural reset that is removing excessive leverage from the system. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Adds $105M To His ETH Position – $1.33B Bought Since Nov 4 Data shows that open interest — the total value of active futures contracts — has fallen by 21% over the past 90 days, marking one of the steepest declines of the cycle. This drop reflects traders reducing risk exposure and liquidations steadily clearing overleveraged positions. Darkfost notes that leverage usage is gradually cooling down, with the current drawdown echoing previous cleansing phases seen in September 2024 and April 2025. Historically, such periods of forced unwinding have preceded new market strength as liquidity stabilizes and speculative excess fades. Deleveraging Signals a Potential Turning Point for Bitcoin Darkfost explains that the current deleveraging phase bears striking similarities to previous corrective periods that ultimately paved the way for major recoveries. During the September 2024 and April 2025 corrections, open interest fell by approximately 24% and 29%, respectively — deep enough to flush out excessive speculation and restore balance across the market. With the current 21% decline in open interest over the last three months, Bitcoin is now approaching those same historical levels of leverage reduction. According to Darkfost, these phases are not necessarily bearish; instead, they serve as healthy resets during bullish market cycles. By forcing overleveraged traders to exit and cooling down speculative behavior, the market is able to rebuild on a stronger, more stable foundation. In past cycles, such unwinding events were often followed by trend reversals once selling pressure eased and new demand emerged. The reduction in leverage also tends to attract long-term investors and institutions seeking lower-risk entry points. If Bitcoin continues to hold its ground above $100K through this period of structural cleanup, it could signal that the worst of the correction is over, setting the stage for a potential new impulse phase once confidence returns. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inflows To Binance Surge: Daily Average Hits 7,500 BTC BTC Tests Support As Consolidation Continues Above $100K The weekly Bitcoin chart shows that BTC remains in a tight consolidation range between $100,000 and $105,000, testing key structural support. The price has repeatedly defended the 100-day moving average (blue line), indicating that despite sustained selling pressure, buyers continue to step in around this psychological zone. The overall trend remains bullish on higher timeframes, with the 200-week moving average (red line) trending upward and well below current price action — a signal that Bitcoin’s long-term market structure remains intact. However, momentum indicators reflect weakness, as BTC struggles to reclaim the $110,000 resistance level that capped previous rebound attempts. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH-MVRV Rebounds From Local Low – Potential Recovery Toward $115K–$120K Trading volume has decreased since the October liquidation event, aligning with Darkfost’s observation that the market is undergoing a deleveraging phase. This lower volume environment suggests investor hesitation but also indicates that forced selling may be nearing exhaustion. A decisive weekly close above $106,000 could confirm renewed bullish momentum, while a breakdown below $100,000 might trigger deeper corrections toward $92,000 — the next major support zone.

    "body": "Solana (SOL) is once again under intense market scrutiny as a combination of fading memecoin activity, declining user engagement, and continuous token unlocks by Alameda Research puts pressure on one of crypto’s strongest 2025 performers. Related Reading: Ethereum Ready To Explode To $12,000 By January, Says Tom Lee While institutional inflows via ETFs remain robust, Solana’s ability to defend key technical levels, particularly the $140–$150 demand zone, will determine whether the asset stabilizes or slides into a deeper correction. Memecoin Cooldown Sends User Activity to One-Year Low Solana’s explosive rise in late 2024 and early 2025 was largely fueled by rapid memecoin launches and hyperactive retail speculation. But that frenzy has sharply cooled. According to Glassnode and The Block, the number of daily active addresses has dropped to 3.3 million, down from over 9 million at the start of the year, marking a 12-month low. Most of the decline comes from the disappearance of bots and short-term users who flooded the chain during its speculative peak. This slowdown has immediate consequences. Lower address activity has translated into softer fee revenue and thinner liquidity, making SOL more sensitive to market shocks. Analysts warn that until new high-utility use cases, such as payments, gaming, or real-world asset apps, attract stickier users, Solana’s engagement metrics may continue to oscillate with speculative cycles. Despite this decline, Solana’s ecosystem remains fundamentally strong. Its DeFi TVL stands at nearly $10 billion, supported by Jupiter, Jito, and Kamino, while developers continue to build stablecoin primitives, high-throughput consumer applications, and institutional-grade infrastructure, such as Firedancer. SOL's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD chart from Tradingview Alameda Unlocks Clash With Record Solana ETF Inflows Another major pressure point is the ongoing monthly SOL unlocks from the FTX/Alameda bankruptcy estate. On November 11, Alameda unstaked 193,000 SOL ($30 million), part of a vesting schedule that runs through 2028. These tokens often find their way to exchanges, creating short-term selling pressure. However, institutional demand is delivering the opposite effect. Solana has now recorded 10–11 consecutive days of ETF inflows, totaling $336 million for the week. Bitwise and Grayscale Solana ETFs collectively hold $351 million, and even traditional institutions like Rothschild Investment and PNC Financial Services have disclosed new positions. SoFi Bank’s move to enable direct SOL purchases from U.S. checking accounts has further legitimized Solana within the regulated finance sector. This tug-of-war, systematic selling vs. accelerating inflows, defines Solana’s current volatility. Technical Setup: $140 Is the Line in the Sand SOL is trading around $152–$156, having broken below key support at $156 amid rising volume. Indicators remain bearish: OBV continues trending downward, signaling persistent seller dominance. Market structure shows lower highs and lower lows since early November. Liquidity heatmaps reveal strong magnetic zones at $144 and $140, making a retest highly likely. Analysts view $140 as the crucial support area. If it fails, liquidity extends toward $120, opening the door for a deeper correction.

    "body": "On Thursday, the Bitcoin price fell toward the $98,000 mark, with November shaping up to mirror October’s performance as the market’s leading cryptocurrency continues to hit lower lows over the past month, confirming a prevalent downtrend in the market. Bitcoin Price Uncertainty Grows Post-Government Shutdown This downturn is indicative of growing market uncertainty, particularly following President Donald Trump’s signing of a bill that ended the longest government shutdown in US history on Wednesday. Related Reading: Solana at a Breaking Point: Fading Memecoin Hype and Alameda Unlocks Test the $140 Support Zone More concerning, market analyst Ali Martinez has suggested that the Bitcoin price may be forming a head-and-shoulders pattern. According to his analysis, this could set the stage for a significant drop to as low as $83,000. This would represent an additional 15% decline if the pattern holds true. Adding to the worries for bullish investors, Bitcoin has recently fallen below its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), an historical key technical support for the cryptocurrency’s price in bullish cycles. The expert now indicates that a break below this key level during bear markets often leads to significant declines, potentially leading the Bitcoin price under its realized price, currently pegged at $56,200. This would imply that BTC could see a further 42% drop from current trading prices. Crypto Winter Looms Despite the expectation of bullish catalysts such as increased liquidity and potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, along with positive macroeconomic data, the outlook for the Bitcoin price suggests the possibility of a new bear market. Related Reading: $1.33B Ethereum Whale Just Moved Another $120M USDT to Binance – Details Ali Martinez’s analysis implies that bearish sentiment is gaining momentum, raising concerns about an impending “crypto winter” unfolding for investors once again this year. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $98,150, marking a loss of nearly 13% over the past thirty days and erasing most of the gains it had accumulated throughout the year. In this time frame, it has only posted a 9% gain. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Earns Academic Praise: University Study Calls It ‘Gold In Your Hands’",
    "body": "According to reports, a bipartisan draft bill in the US Senate has reignited arguments about whether XRP is a commodity or a security. Related Reading: XRP Has Held Its Ground As Most Altcoins Fall, Market Observers Say The Bipartisan Market Structure Draft would divide oversight: the Commodity Futures Trading Commission would police digital commodities like XRP and Bitcoin, while the Securities and Exchange Commission would keep authority over traditional securities. Proponents say the move could remove years of legal uncertainty for many tokens. Durham Study Frames XRP As Commodity Based on reports, academic work from Durham University has entered the debate. Ludovico Rella published a paper in the Journal Of Cultural Economy five years ago that examined how money works as both a tool and a social system. Rella used Ripple and XRP as main examples and described XRP as a “radical form of commodity money.” He also used the term “digital metallism” to show how XRP can be seen as a self-standing asset that holds value without relying on company liabilities or shares. What stands out most is his vivid description of XRP as “like gold in your hands” — a digital asset designed to be “the most liquid of assets on the XRP Ledger.” XRP’s Dual Role In Payments Rella argued that XRP plays two clear roles. It behaves like a digital asset with commodity-like traits and it also serves as part of Ripple’s payment network, acting as a bridge asset for moving money across borders. The study traces Ripple’s path from a trust-based mutual credit system to a blockchain-powered payments network focused on speed and liquidity. That historical arc helps explain why some users treat XRP as an independent store of value while others use it as a tool for cross-border transfers. Lawmakers Push For Clarity Reports have disclosed that senators behind the draft want to make legal lines cleaner so firms and markets know which rules apply. Many in the XRP community reacted quickly, pointing to the 2023 court ruling that found XRP was not a security as evidence that the token belongs under CFTC oversight. Commentators in the space argue the combination of that court decision and new legislation could finally put the question to rest. Related Reading: Dogecoin Alert! Price Could Explode Over 2,800%, Analyst Says Market Moves Add Weight To The Debate Data cited by community members has been used to underline the argument. According to reports, XRP now processes over $5 trillion a year, and Ripple executives have spoken about CBDC pilots and network growth that could place XRP at the center of large payment flows. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has set a target of capturing 14% of SWIFT’s $150 trillion volume, a share that would represent about $40 trillion by 2030 if reached. Price action has followed the chatter: XRP traded at $2.50, up from $2.40 and showing a 4% gain at the time of the latest report. Daily trade volume rose by 52%, with nearly $5.8 billion in XRP changing hands. Featured image from Gemini, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "An analyst has sounded the alarm on what could become one of the most explosive rally in XRP’s history. As the cryptocurrency prepares for its long-awaited Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) debut, the balance of XRP on major exchanges continues to decline. Analysts are warning that an impending supply crisis could spark a significant surge in the XRP price, which is currently more than 34% below its all-time high levels. XRP Supply Shortage To Trigger Parabolic Surge Amidst ongoing market volatility and whale capitulation, crypto market expert Arthur remains positive about XRP, drawing attention to a series of on-chain developments that could mark the beginning of a parabolic upward move. In his post on X social media, the analyst emphasized that an XRP could soon see a supply crisis, which may ignite its next price explosion. Related Reading: Pundit Reveals Final Nail In The Coffin For XRP, What This Means According to recent chart data from CryptoQuant, XRP reserves on Binance have fallen to about 2.79 million tokens, marking a sustained decline that began in early 2025. The chart also shows that while XRP’s price has remained relatively stable between $2 and $3, the available supply on almost all major cryptocurrency exchanges has continued to decline drastically. Arthur has revealed that this signals a growing imbalance between supply and demand, which could set the foundation for a bullish move. Arthur has also referenced a prediction made by JPMorgan analysts, who estimated that between $4 to $8 billion could flow into the upcoming XRP Spot ETFs once they launch in the market. This projection indicates confidence in XRP’s future institutional demand and interest as a legitimate digital asset class. The analyst has suggested that increased ETF demand from institutions, combined with limited liquidity, could create a “perfect storm” for a price breakout of XRP. Additionally, the analyst has revealed that the XRP ETF could also see a surge in retail demand, contributing to its projected price appreciation. Currently, reports indicate that approval of XRP Spot ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still pending. However, prominent analysts like Nate Geraci remain confident that these investment products will be launched soon. Binance XRP Reserve Data Shows Steady Losses Delving deeper into XRP’s supply on exchanges, CryptoQuant’s data shows that the cryptocurrency’s reserve on Binance is sitting at approximately 2.785 billion tokens as of November 12, 2025. Notably, this marks a decrease of over 10 million tokens from the previous day, when 2.795 billion XRP was recorded. Since the beginning of November, Binance’s XRP balance has been declining, hovering just above the 2.7 billion token threshold. Related Reading: $300 Million Worth Of XRP On The Move – Where Are They Headed? Earlier in October, reserves dipped to 2.74 billion tokens, one of the lowest levels recorded in almost a year. While balances briefly rebounded in mid-October, the latest data shows a renewed downward trajectory, suggesting that selling pressure may have eased and accumulation could be taking place off exchanges.

    "body": "In a latest update, BeLaunch posed the high-stakes question: Could SUI really reach $20 in the next bull cycle? After getting hit hard during the October 10 flash crash, SUI is starting to show strength again, and the charts are now painting a very interesting picture that could signal the beginning of a major turnaround. Potential Scenarios For SUI BeLaunch recently outlined two possible scenarios for SUI’s next move, each with distinct probabilities and implications. According to the analysis, the token is currently at a critical juncture, where its next few moves could determine the broader market‘s direction. Related Reading: SUI Eyes Key Retest As Price Breaks Out Of Downtrend – Rally To $3 Ahead? In the primary scenario, which carries an 8/10 probability, SUI is testing a crucial breakout above the red dashed resistance line. Wave (2) appears to have completed its cycle, setting the stage for Wave (3) — typically one of the most impulsive moves in the Elliott Wave structure. A confirmed breakout at this level could propel SUI toward new highs. The alternative scenario, rated at a 3/10 probability, suggests that the current price structure could remain corrective. In this case, SUI may form an alternative X wave near the $5.37 region before extending into another corrective phase (Alt Y). Although less likely, BeLaunch noted that traders should still monitor this possibility closely. Technical and On-Chain Alignment Suggests Market Bottom Nearing According to BeLaunch, on-chain fundamentals for SUI are showing early signs of recovery, despite broader market attention remaining elsewhere. The data reveals that Total Value Locked (TVL) has been holding firm around $1.4 billion, though the analyst notes that a move above the $2 billion threshold would mark a more decisive shift in momentum. At the same time, Daily Active Users (DAU) have been climbing gradually, now sitting near 900,000. Related Reading: Analyst Says SUI Price Could Be Heading To $9: 4 Reasons Why BeLaunch noted that despite this encouraging on-chain behavior, SUI’s price remains lagging, a common indicator of a classic accumulation phase. During such periods, investors often underestimate the asset’s underlying strength while long-term players quietly position themselves ahead of a potential breakout. Historically, SUI has shown a tendency to rally within two to four weeks after both TVL and DAU metrics begin trending upward. If this pattern repeats, it could signal that SUI is currently in a quiet accumulation window before a stronger move to the upside. This alignment between historical behavior and present data gives a subtle yet compelling bullish undertone. Overall, BeLaunch emphasized that the technical and on-chain setup appears robust. Fundamentals are stabilizing, momentum indicators are shifting, and WaveTrend signals are flashing a bottom below 40. If the current trend persists, SUI could soon emerge from consolidation and enter a new bullish phase. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Who’s Selling Bitcoin? Fidelity Research Boss Breaks It Down",
    "body": "Visible buying from spot bitcoin ETPs and corporates has not translated into decisive upside, leaving traders to ask a blunt question: who is supplying the market? For Chris Kuiper, CFA, vice president of research at Fidelity Digital Assets, the answer is clear. “ ‘Who is selling?’ is the number one question I’ve been getting regarding bitcoin’s continued price pressure against a backdrop of visible buying,” he wrote on X on November 12. “I’m not unique in suggesting it’s the long-term holders (or HODLers).” Kuiper points to a simple but powerful on-chain gauge: the percentage of outstanding bitcoin that has not moved for at least one year. Glassnode’s “Percent of Supply Last Active 1+ Years Ago” rises in bear markets as coins age in place and investors sit on unrealized losses, then typically falls sharply when bull markets let those same investors exit into strength. Related Reading: Bitcoin Death Cross Is Coming: Don’t Be Fooled By The Name “As you can see in the chart below, this line goes up during bear markets … and then usually a dramatic decline as these longer-term holders sell into the strength of a bull market,” Kuiper explained. What stands out to him today is that “with this cycle” the drawdown is “a relatively gentle slope down.” When bitcoin hit new highs earlier this year, the long-term-holder line “didn’t plunge,” he said. Instead, the market has been experiencing “a consistent slow bleed as the market has slowly moved sideways and up.” That slow bleed aligns with what Kuiper says he hears from the client side. “Bitcoin’s performance has recently lagged gold’s, even the S&P, and people are getting tired,” he wrote. Many investors, in his view, had been positioned for a textbook four-year cycle blow-off and were “waiting to sell into the historically strong seasonality of October and now November.” When October’s typical strength did not materialize and year-end approached, “long-term holders are looking to make year-end tax and positional changes, calling it a day with the gains they already have.” Related Reading: Bitcoin “Arguably Undervalued,” Says Analytics Firm: Here’s Why The Glassnode chart shows how different this looks from past cycles. In the 2017–2018 run-up and subsequent reversal, the share of coins last active more than a year ago rolled over violently as price spiked and then collapsed. In the current cycle, the curve that represents long-term-holder supply has been trending lower since 2023, but without the vertical collapse normally associated with euphoric distribution. On-chain analyst Julio Moreno of CryptoQuant added another layer by reframing the same dynamic as “1-year inactive supply drawdown” in percentage points of total supply. “Here’s another way to visualize this,” he replied to Kuiper, “by looking at the 1-year inactive supply drawdown in terms of % of total Bitcoin supply.” Moreno quantified the last three major cycles. In 2017–2018, 1-year inactive supply declined by about 20 percentage points of total supply. In the 2021 cycle, the drawdown was around 10 percentage points. In the 2024–2025 period so far, the decline is again roughly 10 percentage points. The CryptoQuant chart, which uses an inverted scale, renders that as a purple wave that rises as more long-dormant coins are spent or reallocated. This means that long-term holders have already released a volume of supply comparable to the 2021 cycle, even if it is still well below the 2017–2018 peak. What differs is the tempo. Rather than a short burst of profit-taking at the top, the market has absorbed roughly a 10-percentage-point reduction in inactive supply over a longer, choppier price path. Kuiper welcomed the alternative visualization, replying simply: “Great chart!” He also made clear what he will be monitoring from here. “I will be watching this slope along with some other metrics to gauge seller exhaustion,” he said. For now, he argues that “the positive fundamental developments and lackluster price action continue to diverge.” At press time, BTC traded at $102,609.

    "title": "Bitcoin Moves Beyond Retail — Institutional Ownership Now Defines The Market",
    "body": "Bitcoin is no longer the speculative playground it once was. What began as a retail-driven movement powered by early adopters and crypto enthusiasts has evolved into a market increasingly shaped by institutional capital, from BTC ETFs absorbing billions in inflows to corporations and hedge funds adding BTC to their balance sheets. Why Institutional Accumulation Has Changed Bitcoin Volatility The narrative around Bitcoin has undergone a fundamental transaction. According to the Arch Network post on X, the institutional participant in Bitcoin is no longer emerging; it’s already established. Spot Bitcoin ETF now holds over 1 million BTC, which is roughly 5% of the total supply. Daily inflows through mid-2025 have averaged between $300 and $500 million, with a cumulative asset close to $60 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Recovers Past $105K as Shutdown Relief and Whale Buying Fuel Bullish Reversal Furthermore, the reach of this integration is global, with more than half of the world’s top asset managers now having indirect exposure to BTC through these accessible ETF structures. However, while this level of adoption is bullish, a significant challenge is that most of this BTC remains idle in cold storage. This model secures exposure but fundamentally does not generate return. Presently, for the institutions managing trillions in assets, the model is losing relevance. A productive BTC stack that combines robust security with consistent yield generation is becoming the natural next step for capital markets. An ambassador at NEARProtocol and Somnia_Network, Trader Onur, has highlighted that Bitcoin ETF recorded $524 million daily inflows on Tuesday, marking the biggest since the crash. The derivatives market is flashing similar signals that smart money just stacked $8.5 million in BTC longs. This shows retailers are still nervous, but institutions are quietly positioning. If the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) print is favorable, it could set the tone for the year-end momentum. How Flows Can Confirm Or Contradict Market Mood The selling momentum in Bitcoin spot ETF flows has stalled for now. A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, has pointed out that the BTC price has held the $100,000 region for now, as a lot of outflows and bad sentiment have taken place. However, the BTC price is also failing to push higher on the back of it. Related Reading: Bitcoin At A Battleground — This Price Range Will Decide the Next Cycle Phase As Daan noted, ETF flow data is a lagging indicator and useful mostly in hindsight. Nonetheless, when large outflows occur and the price refuses to drop further, it could be considered as short-term bullish absorption. Additionally, when heavy inflows fail to lift the price higher, it can signal local tops. These patterns have played out multiple times in this cycle, and they often occur at the key pivot zones where market direction shifts. Daan believes that it’s still valuable to watch how the price behaves around major ETF in- and outflow days. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Sentiment Most Fearful Since March: Is A Bottom Near?",
    "body": "As Bitcoin continues to show a bearish trajectory, the cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index has fallen to its lowest extreme fear level since March. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Suggests Investors Are Extremely Fearful The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment that’s present among traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Chainlink’s Next Major Move Comes After This Range, Analyst Says The index uses the data of the following five factors to determine the investor mentality: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social sentiment, and Google Trends. It then represents the sentiment using a scale running from 0 to 100. All values above 53 correspond to a net sentiment of greed, while those below 47 imply fear in the market. The indicator being between these two cutoffs naturally suggests a neutral mentality among the investors. Besides these three main zones, there are also two “extreme” sentiments: extreme fear and extreme greed. The former takes place below 25 and the latter above 75. Currently, the Fear & Greed Index is in one of these zones. As is visible above, the Fear & Greed Index has a value of 15 at the moment, firmly inside the extreme fear territory. Sentiment among investors was already poor on Wednesday, but this latest value is even worse. The deterioration of sentiment is a result of Bitcoin retracing its recent recovery. While traders may be highly bearish toward the market right now, BTC and other assets don’t necessarily have to live up to expectations. In fact, if history is anything to go by, cryptocurrencies have often shown moves that directly go contrary to the crowd’s opinion. Many major tops and bottoms in the sector have formed alongside a sentiment of extreme greed and extreme fear, respectively. Given this, it’s possible that the latest foray into extreme fear could also lead to a bottom for Bitcoin and others. When that might happen, however, is anyone’s guess. The latest extreme fear sentiment is the strongest since early March, but the low back then didn’t coincide with BTC’s real bottom. That said, Bitcoin did find a temporary turnaround just a few days after, which lasted until the end of the month. In April, the market crashed again, and the Fear & Greed Index declined to a low of 18. This time, the extreme fear sentiment was enough to reignite real bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Arguably Undervalued,” Says Analytics Firm: Here’s Why It now remains to be seen whether the current low in the indicator will be enough for the market to reach a bottom, or if sentiment will worsen still. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $103,100, down 2% over the last 24 hours. Featured image from Dall-E, Alternative.me, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "XRP price started a fresh decline from $2.550. The price is now showing bearish signs and might extend losses if it dips below $2.250. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.450 zone. The price is now trading below $2.40 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $2.235 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below $2.250. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price attempted more gains above $2.50 but failed to continue higher, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price started a fresh decline below $2.450 and $2.420. There was a move below the $2.320 pivot level. A low was formed at $2.2754, and the price is now consolidating losses with a bearish angle below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2.525 swing high to the $2.2754 low. The price is now trading below $2.40 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.2350 level. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $2.235 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $2.40 level, above which the price could rise and test $2.450 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2.525 swing high to the $2.2754 low. A clear move above the $2.450 resistance might send the price toward the $2.520 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.580 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.650. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.40 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.280 level. The next major support is near the $2.250 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.250 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.20. The next major support sits near the $2.120 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.050. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

    "body": "Canary’s spot XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has surpassed most of the experts’ predictions, and it is currently on track to see a record-breaking debut after registering strong institutional demand on its first day. Related Reading: Winklevoss Twins Back Zcash (ZEC) Treasury Company With $58M Investment First Spot XRP ETF Begins Trading On Thursday, the first single-token XRP spot ETF began trading on Nasdaq, smashing the initial performance expectations of multiple experts after clearing the last regulatory hurdles this week. Following the launch of Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF (XRPC), the investment management firm asserted its conviction that “XRP Ledger represents a leading framework for global payments — purpose-built for interoperability and real-world settlement.” Notably, Canary Capital recently completed its 8-A filing for its XRPC ETF with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and received the stock exchange’s green light on Wednesday afternoon. The Thursday launch comes amid the end of the US Government shutdown, which officially lasted 43 days and was forecasted to delay the long-awaited Altcoin ETFs until its conclusion. For context, the SEC was expected to approve multiple crypto-based investment products between early October and November, after the regulatory agency postponed the decision deadline in Q3 and released new generic listing standards for the products. However, the second wave of crypto-based investment products arrived despite the government setback, with the first set of ETFs launching over two weeks ago. On October 28, Canary Capital’s spot Litecoin and Hedera ETFs and Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) began trading after filing 8-A forms with the SEC. As crypto journalist Eleanor Terret explained, the launch was possible because an open government wasn’t required to continue the process, and the 8-A filings are “just as important” as the S-1 forms, since they register ETF shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Canary’s XRPC To Challenge BSOL’s Debut Ahead of the launch, multiple experts predicted that Canary’s spot XRP ETF could see strong demand and reach between $15 million and $35 million in volume on its first day. Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, Eric Balchunas, initially suggested that the investment product could hit $17 million in volume. Following the first half-hour, the XRP ETF saw $26 million in volume, the analyst noted, breaking past his original expectations. As a result, Balchunas suggested that the XRPC had a “good shot” at surpassing BSOL’s first-day volume and becoming the biggest ETF launch of 2025. As reported by NewsBTC, Bitwise’s SOL Staking ETF recorded an impressive volume of $10 million in the first 30 minutes of trading, which surged to $33 million by the half-day mark. The investment product closed its first day with around $57 million in volume, beating all other launches of this year.

In the afternoon, analyst James Seyffart noted that Canary’s XRP ETF had recorded around $46 million in volume by the half-day mark, with a few more hours of trading ahead. The analyst initially suggested that XRPC could see around $34 million in volume on day one. “This is almost guaranteed to be near the top of the list for 2025 launches and still has a shot at beating $BSOL for the top spot,” Seyffart concluded. As of this writing, XRP trades at $2.30, a 3.3% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",
