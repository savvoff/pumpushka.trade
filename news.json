    "title": "$93K And Climbing: Analysts Say Bitcoin’s Push To $100K Has Begun",
    "body": "Bitcoin jumped back above key levels on Wednesday, with prices climbing past $93,000 after dipping to $84,400 earlier this month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trail Ends: $29M Seized After European Authorities Shut Down Cryptomixer The move followed a sharp sell-off that removed about $8,000 from the price late over the weekend, and traders pushed the coin to a 24-hour peak of $93,910 on Coingecko. Bitcoin Climbs Above Key Levels According to MN Fund founder Michaël van de Poppe, regaining ground above $93,000 is important for momentum. He said that if the price holds and breaks higher, a run toward $100,000 becomes more likely. Other analysts echoed the call: Nick Ruck of LVRG Research pointed to macro factors and fresh ETF flows as drivers that could help Bitcoin test six figures in the coming months. This is what you’d want to see. $BTC coming back up again, after a weird move down on the 1st of this month. Now, again, breaking the $92K area is crucial. If that breaks, then I’m sure we’ll start to see a new all-time high and a test at $100K. A great day on the markets. pic.twitter.com/uy6WPabnQ8 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 2, 2025 ETF Activity And Market Moves Reports have disclosed that ETF-related trading helped lift the market. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded over $1.8 billion in volume within two hours after Vanguard reversed a previous stance, and total spot Bitcoin ETF volume topped $5.1 billion on the day. Market stats showed the broader crypto capitalization rose close to 7% to $3.13 trillion, with BTC dominance climbing to nearly 60%. Bitcoin itself jumped by about 8% after the US market opened, giving larger markets a clear lift. Support Zone Holds Focus Analysts had been watching the $86,000 to $88,000 band as a critical area of support. Based on reports from active market watchers, that range had been tested dozens of times in recent months and holding above it signaled reduced selling pressure. One analyst argued that a break below would likely lead some big players to change tack, moving from buying to selling behavior. Liquidations And Net Inflows Changed The Day Other market observers reported heavy turnover in derivatives and spot markets: over $360 billion in short positions were liquidated, while more than $160 billion was reportedly added back into crypto markets within a 24-hour span. Those figures, if accurate, helped explain the speed of the rebound and the large single-day gains. Related Reading: XRP Is About To Hit A Major Turning Point This Week, Analyst Says What Comes Next For Prices Short-term traders will watch how Bitcoin behaves around $92,000 and whether it can hold above the $86,000–$88,000 floor. Some commentators warned that sudden ETF-driven demand can cause sharp spikes that may not last. Others pointed to possible policy shifts, such as renewed talk of US interest-rate cuts, as reasons why money might flow into major crypto assets in the months ahead. For now, prices sit a little above $92,700 at the time of writing. The market is clearly volatile. Investors and traders will likely need to balance the bullish signs against the risk that a fresh round of selling could wipe gains quickly. Featured image from Gemini, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Best Crypto to Buy as Kevin Hassett Takes Fed Chair and Loosens Policy Fueling $BTC",
    "body": "What to Know: A more dovish, crypto-friendly Fed chair like Kevin Hassett could extend a multi‑year liquidity cycle, favoring Bitcoin and high‑beta altcoins. Position sizing, diversification, and risk management remain critical, even when macro conditions and narratives seem heavily tilted in crypto’s favor. Bitcoin Hyper’s SVM-powered Layer 2 aims to unlock low-latency smart contracts and DeFi around $BTC while preserving Bitcoin settlement security. PEPENODE and Dogwifhat provide meme and community-driven upside exposure if easier policy reignites speculative flows into Solana and broader alt markets. Speculation that Kevin Hassett could take over the Fed with a more dovish, pro-risk stance is exactly the kind of macro shift crypto loves. Trump has made repeated references to Hassett , so it wouldn’t come as a surprise. A chair who’s comfortable with deeper rate cuts and friendlier optics toward digital assets doesn’t just move markets for a quarter; it reshapes liquidity conditions for years. Cheaper money and clearer political cover for Bitcoin would likely mean a stronger bid for $BTC first, then a spillover into high-beta altcoins and infrastructure plays. If that happens, you want exposure to assets that benefit structurally from a multi‑year adoption wave. That’s where Bitcoin-focused scaling, speculative meme liquidity, and Solana ecosystem bets start to matter, making them the best crypto to buy . You’re not just guessing charts; you’re aligning with where capital, developers, and users could cluster if 2026–2028 turns into another extended risk cycle. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , and Dogwifhat ($WIF) , although all different, are potentially geared to thrive if a Hassett-led Fed extends easy policy and pushes fresh capital back into crypto. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Bitcoin Layer 2 Bringing Bitcoin Security With SVM Speed If looser Fed policy sends Bitcoin back into price discovery, the next big bottleneck won’t be demand for $BTC, it’ll be what you can do with it. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) positions itself as a Bitcoin Layer 2 with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, aiming to turn dormant $BTC into fully programmable capital. Instead of trying to bolt slow EVM logic onto Bitcoin, $HYPER uses a modular design: Bitcoin L1 for settlement and a real-time SVM-powered L2 for execution. That architecture targets sub-second finality and low fees while anchoring state periodically to Bitcoin, giving builders Solana-style speed with Bitcoin-grade trust assumptions. The project leans on a single trusted sequencer, with periodic L1 state anchoring, and supports SPL-compatible tokens customized for its Layer 2. That opens the door to Solana-like DeFi, swaps, lending, and staking protocols but with wrapped $BTC as a first-class asset, plus Rust SDKs and APIs for gaming dApps and NFT platforms. From a capital-rotation lens, the numbers are already notable. The $HYPER presale has raised over $28.8M with tokens currently at $0.013365, showing a clear appetite from investors looking ahead of any macro pivot. Our experts see future potential as well, with an end-of-2026 price prediction hitting $0.08625. That’d see you with a potential ROI of over 545% if you invested at today’s price. If you get in early, you can also take advantage of dynamic staking rewards, currently sitting at 40%. Being a $HYPER holder, you also get rewards tied to community and governance participation. If you believe a Hassett-led Fed kickstarts a new liquidity cycle centered on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Hyper is a direct bet on scaling that demand. Join the $HYPER presale today. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): Mine-to-Earn Without the Overheads Every easy-money cycle has a meme phase, and if the Fed turns dovish again, you can expect speculative capital to chase narratives that blend culture, game mechanics, and upside. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE ) leans into that with a mine‑to‑earn meme coin pitch, trying to gamify yield and engagement rather than just relying on vibes. Instead of just traditional staking, PEPENODE uses a Virtual Mining System and tiered node rewards to simulate mining economics in a meme wrapper. You effectively run virtual nodes through a gamified dashboard, competing for higher reward tiers and social status. This isn’t only fun, but it can help keep community participation high during volatile markets. Learn how to buy PEPENODE. The $PEPENODE presale has already gained traction, having raised over $2.2M with tokens currently priced at $0.0011778. This puts it firmly in low-cap, high-optional-value territory if meme risk-on returns. And with staking rewards as high as 576% there’s even more incentive to opt-in. That blend of narrative and gameified mechanics gives it a different profile from pure hype coins that rely solely on social media. As a bonus, you can even earn rewards in other popular coins like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN. If dovish policy stokes another wave of speculative flows, $PEPENODE is a way to express that trade in a structured, mine‑to‑earn format rather than a raw punt. Don’t miss the mine and get your $PEPENODE today. 3. Dogwifhat ($WIF): Solana Meme Beta for a Liquidity Wave Any discussion of meme beta in this cycle has to include Dogwifhat ($WIF) , the Solana-based meme coin that’s become a proxy for retail risk appetite. Built on Solana, $WIF benefits from low fees and high throughput, helping speculative traders rotate in and out quickly without the friction you see on slower chains. Recent market action underlines that reflexivity. $WIF rallied over 20% in a single seven‑day stretch, reclaiming momentum among Solana meme coins. It currently sits around rank #109 by market cap, with strong trading activity and recurring bursts of retail attention. Beyond price, $WIF has a sticky community that treats it as a cultural asset, not just a ticker. In a macro regime where the Fed signals friendlier policy, that kind of community‑driven liquidity can compound quickly as traders hunt for leverage to a Solana-led alt season. If you expect a Hasset Fed to extend the runway for high‑beta risk, Dogwifhat ($WIF) is a straightforward way to capture Solana meme exposure without betting on unproven microcaps. It sits at the intersection of chain narrative, cheap blockspace, and viral culture. Buy $WIF on top exchanges like Binance. Recap: If Kevin Hassett ushers in a looser Fed, Bitcoin Hyper , PEPENODE , and Dogwifhat each offer distinct ways to ride that liquidity wave. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

    "title": "Best Crypto Presales as Coinbase and Bithumb Expand Altcoin Range",
    "body": "What to Know: Coinbase and Bithumb are expanding altcoin listings into a recovering stablecoin market. This signals returning risk appetite, bolstering the case for curated presale exposure. Bitcoin Hyper brings SVM execution and extremely low-latency processing to a Bitcoin Layer 2, targeting wrapped $BTC payments, DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Maxi Doge and Pumpd offer higher‑beta meme exposure, the former around leverage‑trader culture, the latter around automated burns and AI market tooling. Altcoin risk appetite is quietly returning. Coinbase’s latest roadmap additions and Bithumb’s fresh KRW pairs show that big, regulated venues are finally widening the funnel again, just as spot volumes and stablecoin float start to recover from 2024’s drawdown. When top-tier exchanges expand listings to improve liquidity, it’s usually not about chasing memes; it’s about preparing inventory for the next rotation. Historically, periods like this have front‑run broad alt seasons as sidelined capital migrates from $BTC and stablecoins into higher‑beta narratives. You’re also seeing a structural shift under the surface. Stablecoin market caps are ticking higher , basis trades are back on, and derivatives funding is no longer screaming fear. That combination tends to favor early‑stage bets: investors look for presales that marry strong narratives with credible tech and clear token utility. Against that backdrop, three of the best crypto presales stand out across very different corners of the market: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) as a high‑throughput Bitcoin Layer 2, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) as a hyper‑speculative trading culture play, and Pumpd ($PUMPD) as an experiment in algorithmic meme tokenomics and AI tooling. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): The High-Performance Layer 2 for the Bitcoin Economy Bitcoin established the foundation of digital finance as the ultimate store of value. But to power the next generation of Web3, the network needs speed and utility without sacrificing security. Introducing Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a revolutionary Layer 2 scaling solution engineered to take Bitcoin further. Bitcoin Hyper differentiates itself by integrating the high-performance Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) directly atop Bitcoin’s security anchor. This unique architecture leverages the SVM’s parallel processing capabilities to deliver sub-second finality and negligible gas fees, making high-frequency trading and complex DeFi finally viable on Bitcoin. Furthermore, onboarding assets is secure and seamless via its robust canonical bridge. This trust-minimized gateway ensures that native $BTC can be safely ported onto the Bitcoin Hyper network without relying on centralized intermediaries. Want a bit more project info? We’ve got you covered in our ‘ What is Bitcoin Hyper ’ guide. The native $HYPER token fuels this rapidly expanding ecosystem, serving as the essential currency for network transaction fees and decentralized governance. Bitcoin Hyper isn’t just faster money; it is the sophisticated infrastructure needed for a decentralized future built on the bedrock of Bitcoin. $HYPER’s already flying high, having raised over $28.8M in its presale. It currently offers you 40% staking rewards, and there have been some hefty whale purchases, one of $500K , showing that smart money sees it as a viable play. Buy your $HYPER today for $0.013365. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Meme Token for Leverage Degens Maxi Doge ($MAXI) leans unapologetically into the leverage culture that still defines much of crypto trading. Branded as a 240‑lb canine juggernaut, it’s less about utility primitives and more about capturing the 1000x mentality through community competition, and the ‘never skip leg-day, never skip a pump’ attitude. The core pitch is ‘Leverage King Culture’: a meme asset that personifies the high‑risk, high‑reward ethos of perpetual traders while avoiding actual 1000x leverage on platforms that blow up accounts. Holder‑only trading competitions, performance leaderboards, and reward campaigns in the future will turn speculative behavior itself into content and community glue. Already sold on the vibe? Check out our ‘ How to Buy Maxi Doge ’ guide to see how to get in on the action. On the numbers side, the Maxi Doge presale has raised over $4.2M so far, with tokens currently at $0.000271. That’s a meaningful war chest for marketing, liquidity provisioning, and partnerships through its Maxi Fund treasury, which is earmarked to support listings and ecosystem collaborations as conditions improve. Staking comes with a dynamic APY model currently offering 72% rewards, which can flex based on treasury performance and market conditions. If you believe meme liquidity roars back whenever alt seasons kick off, Maxi Doge offers a focused bet on that behavior. Buy Maxi Doge in its presale now. 3. Pumpd ($PUMPD): Daily-Pump Meme Coin With AI Trading Tools Pumpd ($PUMPD) pushes meme tokenomics into more programmatic territory. It’s a meme‑driven project whose smart contract encodes daily price increase mechanics, an automated burn schedule tied to market triggers, and AI‑powered analytics tools designed to help holders trade more intelligently across the broader market. The token includes a ‘daily pump’ parameter baked into the contract, effectively engineering a persistent upward bias in the quoted presale price while supply gets reduced via automatic burns. Those burns are triggered by specific market conditions, removing tokens from circulation without relying on manual team actions or discretionary treasury moves. On top of that, Pumpd is building AI systems that scan markets, whale wallets, and social sentiment for trading signals, with the goal of turning raw volatility into structured alerts and dashboards for the community. It’s still firmly a meme coin, but one that tries to justify attention with data‑driven tools rather than vibes alone. The project remains in an active presale phase, with guaranteed daily price steps and a growing set of launchpad and AI integrations. As an emerging meme play with a more advanced technical stack, Pumpd fits investors who want speculative upside plus a narrative around automation and on‑chain intelligence rather than pure branding. Get your $PUMPD for $0.000412. Recap: With big exchanges expanding altcoin listings into a recovering liquidity backdrop, the best crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper , Maxi Doge , and Pumpd offer very different ways to position for the next cycle. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

    "title": "Are Dogecoin Whales Leaving The Meme Coin? Large Transactions Crash To 2-Month Lows",
    "body": "Dogecoin’s recent price action has taken an unexpected turn as on-chain data shows whale transactions collapsing to levels not seen in two months. This lack of activity from whale addresses has seen the meme coin falling to an important support area, and it raises the question about whether big players are stepping back from the meme coin. Dogecoin Whale Activity Falls To Its Lowest Level In 60 Days Data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment reveals that large transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain recently fell to as low as just 4 in a single day, marking a two-month low in whale participation. Santiment classifies whale transaction count as transactions with a value of $1 million or greater. This drop is notable, as it is a drastic change from the high levels of participation of whale traders in October and early November, which reached as high as 212 whale transactions on October 11. Related Reading: Here’s What To Expect If The XRP Price Holds $2 This drop is an extension of a steady Dogecoin cooldown that has persisted through the past few weeks. Large-holder activity can serve as a proxy for institutional or high-volume investors. Therefore, the current decline suggests that big players are either waiting for better entry conditions or scaling back exposure. At the time of writing, Santiment data shows that there were 11 Dogecoin whale transactions in the past 24 hours. Although this is a rebound from the alarming four-transaction low, the current level is far below what is considered a healthy range for a cryptocurrency that relies heavily on sentiment bursts of activity. The reduction in transfers is especially notable at a time when Dogecoin’s price action in the past 24 hours is attempting to maintain an important level above $0.15. Dogecoin Whale Transaction Count. Source: Santiment DOGE Holds Support, But Technical Momentum Weakens Price action in the past few weeks has been mostly bearish price action, and technical analysis shows that the meme coin is now in its longest accumulation phase since its inception. Related Reading: Ripple Marks Another Milestone In Bid To Dominate Global Payments With XRP Dogecoin Price Accumulation. Source: @galaxyBTC On X Notably, Dogecoin is going through a spark of strength over the past 24 hours as it bounced from $0.134 and climbed about 11%, but the recovery appears to be generated by retail traders rather than a meaningful return of whale activity. That estimation aligns with the weak inflows into Spot Dogecoin ETFs and the overall quietness from major holders. It is difficult for the price to build a strong upward trend without whales participating on the buy side. It’s not just the presence of whales that matters, but the nature of their activity. Earlier in the year, on October 11, whale transactions surged to 212, but most of those were sell orders. The result was immediate and painful, as the Dogecoin price dropped from $0.25 to $0.18 in a single day. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Wall Street FOMO Over Vanguard’s Bitcoin ETF Pivot: $HYPER Rides the Wave",
    "body": "What to Know: Vanguard’s embrace of spot Bitcoin ETFs adds another giant gatekeeper to the BTC on-ramp, channeling retirement and retail capital into the asset. As Bitcoin becomes an ETF-friendly macro asset, traders seeking more upside are rotating toward higher-risk ecosystem plays and infrastructure tokens. Bitcoin Hyper targets Bitcoin’s limitations on speed, fees, and programmability by integrating SVM on a modular Layer 2 anchored to $BTC settlement. The Bitcoin Layer 2 race is intensifying as projects compete to capture DeFi, gaming, and payments flows that the base Bitcoin network cannot natively support. For years, Vanguard stood out as the big asset manager that wanted nothing to do with spot Bitcoin ETFs. That stance quietly shifted , and the pivot matters. When a $9+ trillion retirement giant opens the door to $BTC exposure, it adds another massive gatekeeper to the on-ramp for mainstream capital. It saw $BTC rally on Tuesday, jumping back up to the $92K mark from a recent dip below the $86K region. You now have BlackRock, Fidelity, and Vanguard funneling retirement portfolios, 401(k)s, and brokerage accounts into spot Bitcoin. That flow doesn’t just push up $BTC’s market cap; it changes how traditional investors think about crypto risk. Bitcoin starts to look like ‘digital gold core holding,’ not a speculative side bet. The knock-on effect is obvious for traders: if Bitcoin becomes the safe, ETF-wrapped asset, the search for higher-octane upside moves further out on the risk curve. That’s where ecosystem plays, infrastructure tokens, and early-stage presales come in. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself exactly in that lane, pitching itself as a Bitcoin-native Layer 2 with Solana-grade performance. As capital crowds into spot BTC via TradFi rails, the question for more aggressive crypto traders isn’t ‘Should I own Bitcoin?’ anymore. It’s ‘Where can I get leveraged exposure to the Bitcoin network’s growth without using actual leverage?’ For some, that answer increasingly looks like ecosystem bets such as Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) and other high-throughput Bitcoin Layer 2s. Why Wall Street’s Bitcoin Obsession Pushes Attention To Layer 2 Wall Street’s ETF embrace solves one thing: easy Bitcoin exposure inside familiar accounts. It doesn’t solve Bitcoin’s technical pain points. The base layer still processes roughly 7 transactions per second , with confirmation times measured in minutes and fees that spike into double digits when mempools clog. That limitation is a feature for store-of-value purists, but a brick wall for anyone wanting DeFi, gaming, or consumer apps atop Bitcoin. So you’re seeing a rush of infrastructure projects racing to bolt smart contracts and high throughput onto $BTC without compromising its settlement assurances. Competing visions include Ordinals-centric tooling, sidechains like Rootstock, and experimental rollup frameworks. In that crowded field, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is pitching itself as a unique contender, differentiating through Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) compatibility. It has an explicit focus on traders and DeFi power users looking to amplify Bitcoin’s upside rather than just hold ETF shares. You can buy $HYPER for $0.013365 while it’s still in its presale, and take advantage of 40% staking rewards. Bitcoin Hyper’s Bet: Solana Performance, Bitcoin Settlement Zooming in, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) markets itself as ‘the first ever Bitcoin Layer 2 with SVM integration,’ aiming to deliver performance that can exceed Solana’s own execution speeds. Anchored by a canonical bridge that links Bitcoin’s security to high-speed execution, Bitcoin Hyper’s modular architecture combines the best of both worlds. The system relies on Bitcoin L1 for settlement while offloading processing to a real-time SVM Layer 2, where a single sequencer commits state roots on-chain. This bridge allows you to escape L1 congestion and access an ecosystem of instant, low-cost wrapped $BTC payments, NFTs, and DeFi. With support for Rust SDKs and Solana-style APIs, Bitcoin Hyper brings high-performance gaming and complex smart contracts to Bitcoin. If you want more info, check out our ‘ What is Bitcoin Hyper ’ guide. The market seems to be paying attention as the Bitcoin Hyper presale has raised over $28.8M so far. And smart money is moving. High-net-worth wallets have been making purchases as large as $500K . Our experts see a potential end-of-2026 high of $0.08625 , which, if you bought at today’s price, would see you with a potential ROI of over 545%. If you believe Vanguard and its peers will keep funneling conservative capital into spot Bitcoin, Layer 2s like $HYPER offer a different angle: upside tied not just to $BTC’s price, but to whether Bitcoin can finally host high-throughput applications at scale. Join the $HYPER presale. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

    "title": "Next 1000x Crypto for Bitcoin Believers? Bitcoin Hyper Presale Eyes Layer 2 Breakout",
    "body": "What to Know: Even as Bitcoin holds around $93K, Bitcoin’s base layer remains secure but slow, with high fees and no native smart contract environment, limiting real on-chain activity for everyday users. As demand for scalable on-chain applications grows, the lack of a high-speed execution layer around Bitcoin creates a structural gap for DeFi, gaming, and payments. Bitcoin Hyper introduces the first Bitcoin Layer 2 with SVM integration, targeting faster-than-Solana performance while leveraging Bitcoin as the settlement backbone. By delivering extremely low-latency execution, fast smart contracts, and Rust-based tooling, Bitcoin Hyper aims to make wrapped $BTC usable across DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. If you’re convinced Bitcoin is marching toward six figures, the bigger question is where the next asymmetric upside comes from. Right now, the world’s leading crypto is holding near $93K. History suggests the highest multiples don’t usually come from the base asset itself, but from the infrastructure built on top of it; think ERC-20 DeFi blue chips riding Ethereum’s 2020 breakout. Bitcoin’s problem is that it never had its own native DeFi and application stack to the same extent. Slow confirmation times, high fees during peak cycles, and the absence of native smart contracts have kept most real on-chain activity on other networks, even as Bitcoin dominates as a store of value and brand. That’s the gap Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is going after: a high-speed Bitcoin Layer 2 that brings Solana-style throughput directly to $BTC’s settlement layer. Instead of asking you to rotate out of Bitcoin into a ‘fast L1,’ Bitcoin Hyper is betting the next 1000x upside comes from plugging DeFi, gaming, and payments into Bitcoin’s existing liquidity. With a presale already into eight figures and early whales circling, Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as a bet not against Bitcoin, but on Bitcoin finally getting the performance layer it has been missing. For $BTC holders who want more than passive ‘number go up,’ that’s a compelling narrative to examine seriously. Bitcoin Hyper Turns BTC Into a High-Speed Application Layer Bitcoin Hyper is built for one simple outcome: letting you use Bitcoin like a modern, high-throughput network without abandoning Bitcoin’s security and brand. It introduces a dedicated Layer 2 that runs smart contracts using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) tooling, tuned to deliver faster performance than Solana itself for real-world transactions. For users, this translates into sub-second confirmation experiences and low fees on wrapped $BTC transfers, swaps, and dApps, rather than waiting on congested Bitcoin blocks. DeFi traders can move into pools, lending markets, and staking strategies at speed, while still ultimately settling back to Bitcoin as the base layer they trust via a Canonical Bridge . If you’re considering getting exposure, here’s a guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper. Developers get a Rust-based SDK and API to ship NFT platforms, gaming dApps, and high-frequency applications without fighting Bitcoin’s base-layer limitations. Bitcoin Hyper explicitly targets Solana-level speed while anchoring to Bitcoin, aiming to keep latency low enough for gaming and real-time apps. The presale has already pulled in $28.8M, a clear signal of early conviction behind the project’s thesis You can explore the Bitcoin Hyper presale now. Can $HYPER Be a 1000x for Bitcoin Maxis? If Bitcoin Hyper captures even a small portion of the broader Bitcoin DeFi and Layer 2 narrative market, our prediction suggests that $HYPER could reach $0.08625, delivering roughly 545% returns from the current presale price of $0.013365. That kind of upside depends on real usage, but the thesis is clear: bring Solana-like performance to where the Bitcoin liquidity already sits. You can read a Bitcoin Hyper price prediction breakdown for more scenario modeling. Momentum is already building around that idea. Whale buys include $500K , $379K , and $274K , all feeding into the $HYPER momentum. If Bitcoin does grind toward six figures over the next cycle, the infrastructure that lets $BTC behave like a modern programmable asset stands to benefit most. What is Bitcoin Hyper? The execution layer for crypto’s flagship: fast, cheap, and plugged directly into the world’s best-known crypto brand. The core opportunity here is simple: Bitcoin retains its role as pristine collateral and base money, while Bitcoin Hyper turns that collateral into something you can actually deploy across DeFi, gaming, and payments at high speed. If the market agrees that the next 1000x comes from building on Bitcoin rather than competing with it, $HYPER sits directly in that slipstream. Join the $HYPER presale now.

    "title": "This Subwave Says Bitcoin Price Is Headed For A 50% Crash To $42,000",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Tony Severino has revealed a historical bearish pattern that could send the Bitcoin price to as low as $42,000. This bearish outlook for BTC comes amid a rebound for the flagship crypto, with a recent surge above the psychological $90,000 level. Bitcoin Price Risks 50% Drop To $42,000 Based On This Pattern In an X post, Severino stated that the Bitcoin price likes to retrace to subwave 3/4 of wave 3/4 of its impulse. Based on this, the analyst indicated that BTC could crash to as low as $42,000 on wave C of this move to the downside. His accompanying chart showed that this decline could happen sometime at the start of next year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Can Hit These ‘Realistic’ Bullish Targets Before The Bear Market Begins This bearish Bitcoin price prediction comes amid BTC’s rebound above $90,000 following the end of quantitative tightening (QT) by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The flagship crypto has also rebounded amid optimism of another rate cut at this month’s FOMC meeting. CME FedWatch data shows there is almost a 90% chance that the Fed will lower rates again this month. However, despite these macro positives for the Bitcoin price, analysts such as Tony Severino have suggested that BTC is in a bear market and is likely to trend lower in the coming months. In an X post, he highlighted the BTC monthly chart, suggesting it showed a subtle volume breakout that confirmed a “not-so-subtle” trendline breakdown. Meanwhile, market technician JT described statements that the QT ending is bullish for the Bitcoin price as being a “fallacy.” He alluded to the possibility that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) may hike rates this month as one of the stressors to liquidity beyond QT. Peter Brandt Predicts Drop To Mid $40ks In an X post, veteran trader and analyst Peter Brandt predicted that the Bitcoin price could drop to mid $40,000. He stated that the upper boundary of the lower green zone starts below $70,000 and that the lower support boundary is in the mid $40,000. Notably, Brandt had previously predicted that BTC could drop to around $50,000 before it then rallies to around $200,000 in the next bull market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks Below 50-MA For The First Time This Cycle, Why A Crash To $38,000 Could Be Coming The veteran analyst noted that there have been five major bull market cycles for the Bitcoin price since its inception. He further stated that in all previous cycles, the violation of the dominant parabolic advance has been followed by a 75% plus correction with no exception. As such, he expects BTC to undergo another significant correction in this cycle, potentially dropping below $50,000. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $93,000, up almost 7% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "Is The Dogecoin Bottom In? This Price Level Could Be The Tell",
    "body": "Dogecoin is staging a sharp rebound from a key technical level that one analyst has flagged as the potential low of its current correction. Is The Dogecoin Bottom In? On X, crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) highlighted the $0.138 region as the decisive line. Posting a weekly DOGE chart, he wrote: “$0.138 still holding strong on Dogecoin. If DOGE can hold this level (Macro .382 + 200W SMA) and BTC + USDT hold their respective support and resistance levels then $0.138 will be the lows for this corrective period. Still got work to do. Main focus is still BTC and USDT D.” His chart shows Dogecoin trading on the 1-week timeframe, with the price recently wicking down into a dense support cluster around $0.138 and rebounding. That area coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement of the prior advance, explicitly marked “0.382 (0.13827),” and the rising 200-week simple moving average that has now climbed into the same zone. Furthermore, this area coincides with an upward trendline that has guided DOGE’s price action since mid-2023; a decisive break below it would be technically fatal. Related Reading: Here’s The Bullish Trend Developing To Trigger A 174% Move For The Dogecoin Price The bounce has been visible on lower timeframes as well. DOGE traded as low as $0.13443 yesterday before surging to $0.152 today, gaining more than 13% at the intraday high. Kevin has been emphasizing this level for weeks. On November 22 he told followers: “$0.138 is massive support on Dogecoin folks. You really do not want to see that lost on 3D-1W closes. Obviously BTC’s performance will be the determiner to that outcome so focus there first along with USDT D.” In his framework, the integrity of the DOGE support cluster is inseparable from Bitcoin’s higher-timeframe structure and stablecoin flows. The macro background is shifting in his favor. Yesterday Bitcoin rebounded from $86,184 to $92,307, extended to $93,958 today and is currently around $92,816. Commenting on BTC, Kevin noted: “A close above $91K on the 3D-1W candle supports the idea that the counter trend rally is beginning in my BTC corrective phase reversal zone. One day doesn’t make a trend let’s see what we can do.” Related Reading: Market Downturn Hits Dogecoin Hard: Is a Larger Correction on the Horizon? That statement builds on his November 25 outlook, where he argued that the corrective phase he has been tracking since August–September on BTC and the “Total 2” altcoin index is nearing completion. “There will be a bottom formed and a counter trend rally in the coming weeks on BTC and Altcoins,” he wrote, adding that “the corrective phase is almost over” but still needs “a little more time to form a proper bottom.” Kevin’s DOGE chart maps the alternatives clearly. Above, horizontal resistance near the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement sits around $0.19, while lower support is marked at the 0.236 retracement near $0.093 alongside longer-term trendlines. Whether $0.138 becomes the definitive bottom of Dogecoin’s correction depends on two conditions Kevin keeps repeating: DOGE must continue to hold the macro 0.382 plus 200-week SMA and the uptrend line on 3-day to weekly closes, and Bitcoin must confirm its own counter-trend rally with sustained higher-timeframe strength. For now, the market has made its tell clear. The answer to whether the Dogecoin bottom is in starts—and potentially ends—at $0.138. At press time, Dogecoin traded at $0.14976.

    "title": "Bitmine Buys Another 18,345 Ethereum ($54.94M) In Fresh Accumulation Push – Details",
    "body": "Ethereum has reclaimed the $3,000 level after a strong market reaction to improving macro conditions, offering investors a much-needed shift in momentum. The move comes just days after the Federal Reserve officially ended Quantitative Tightening (QT), a policy shift that immediately boosted liquidity expectations across all risk assets. With markets now pricing in an imminent interest rate cut, confidence has begun to return, and ETH is one of the first major assets to respond. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidation Dominance Hits Multi-Year High: The Real Cause Behind BTC’s Breakdown This rebound reflects more than just macro relief. According to data from Arkham, shared by Lookonchain, Bitmine continues to accumulate Ethereum at current prices, reinforcing bullish sentiment at a moment when many traders remain cautious. Bitmine’s persistent buying throughout the correction has become one of the most influential signals for on-chain analysts, suggesting that large players see long-term value even as the market wrestles with volatility. Reclaiming $3,000 places Ethereum back above a key psychological level, and the combination of supportive macro policy and whale accumulation provides a stronger foundation than the market had just weeks ago. Bitmine and Linked Wallets Expand Ethereum Holdings According to data from Arkham reported by Lookonchain, Bitmine has purchased another 18,345 ETH, worth approximately $54.94 million, just a few hours ago. This marks yet another large buy in a growing series of aggressive accumulation moves that Bitmine has made throughout the correction. Their continued willingness to buy at current levels signals strong confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value, even as the market navigates heightened volatility. Shortly after this report, Lookonchain highlighted activity from a newly created wallet, 0x52B7, which withdrew 30,278 ETH—valued at $91.16 million—from Kraken. The size and timing of the withdrawal have led analysts to speculate that this wallet may be linked to Bitmine or part of a broader accumulation strategy. Large withdrawals from exchanges typically indicate that the owner intends to hold the assets off-exchange, often for long-term storage or staking, rather than preparing to sell. If the wallet is indeed connected to Bitmine, this would bring their latest combined accumulation to nearly 50,000 ETH in a single day. Such behavior suggests strategic positioning ahead of potential macro-driven upside or internal confidence in Ethereum’s recovery. This kind of synchronized whale activity often precedes significant price shifts, reinforcing the idea that large players are preparing for a stronger market phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Cut In Half As $6.4B In Positions Vanish: Market Reset Accelerates ETH Reclaims $3,000 But Still Faces Key Resistance Ethereum’s 3-day chart shows a notable improvement after reclaiming the $3,000 level, but the broader trend still carries signs of fragility. The recent bounce followed a deep corrective move that sent ETH from the $4,500 region down to the $2,700–$2,800 support zone, where buyers finally stepped in with conviction. The strong lower wicks around this area confirm that demand remains active, but Ethereum has yet to fully recover its bullish structure. Price now trades just below the 50 SMA, which sits near the $3,100–$3,150 zone—an important short-term resistance level. A clean break above this moving average would signal renewed momentum and increase the chances of retesting the $3,400–$3,600 range. Meanwhile, the 100 SMA and 200 SMA remain slightly above price, reflecting the broader downtrend that has dominated since September. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Largest Hidden-Buying Spike of the Cycle Despite Losing $90K Level Volume has picked up slightly during the recovery, but it remains muted compared to the selling spikes seen during the drawdown. This indicates cautious buying rather than aggressive accumulation at these levels. To confirm a trend reversal, ETH must close above the 50 SMA and then challenge the cluster of resistance around $3,200–$3,300. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Analysts Turn Bullish on SUI as Token Extends Gains Amid Renewed Institutional Interest",
    "body": "Sui (SUI) is drawing renewed market attention after staging one of its strongest breakouts in months, rising sharply at a time when most large-cap altcoins remain range-bound. Related Reading: Bitcoin And The 2026 Fed Shift: Expert Says Markets Aren’t Ready The latest 31% surge was triggered by a series of developments that converged within days, most notably Coinbase’s approval to offer SUI trading to New York residents, a move that places the token inside one of the most heavily regulated crypto markets in the U.S. The rally also arrived immediately after one of the largest token unlocks of the month, an event that would normally dampen prices but instead saw buyers step in with force. SUI's price trends to the upside following a steep decline as seen on the daily chart. Source: SUIUSD on Tradingview New York Listing Boosts Liquidity and Institutional Demand SUI surged between 25% and 32% over the past 24 hours after Coinbase confirmed that New York residents can now buy and trade the token across its web and mobile platforms. The approval extends SUI’s reach into one of the most tightly regulated U.S. markets, strengthening its profile as a compliant layer-1 network and increasing accessibility for institutional investors. The listing comes at a notable time. On December 1, SUI unlocked approximately $82–86 million worth of tokens, increasing circulating supply by more than 0.5%. Large unlocks typically pressure prices, but SUI moved higher instead, signaling strong demand absorption. Trading volume has more than doubled, hitting roughly $1.5 billion, levels analysts say indicate genuine accumulation rather than short-lived speculation. The launch of USDsui, a fiat-backed stablecoin designed for payments and DeFi use across the Sui ecosystem, also contributed to renewed interest. Combined with Coinbase’s expansion, these developments have strengthened confidence in Sui’s broader market positioning. SUI Technical Indicators Point to Momentum Shift Price action shows that SUI recently rebounded from November’s lows near $1.12, climbing above the $1.60 support zone. Indicators such as RSI and MACD now suggest easing selling pressure and a potential shift in short-term momentum. Analysts note that breaking above the mid-Bollinger Band near $1.90 would confirm a broader trend reversal. SUI has also moved above the Keltner mid-band for the first time in weeks, with volume delta readings showing strong spot-market buying. The next major resistance sits between $1.80 and $1.95, followed by a wider zone extending to $2.30. A decisive close above $1.92 is viewed as critical for invalidating November’s downtrend. Rally Depends on Volume Holding Market watchers say the current rally hinges on sustained demand. If daily volume remains above $1.5 billion and price holds the $1.60–$1.67 support zone, institutional participation could continue to push the token higher toward the $1.90 level. Related Reading: $93K And Climbing: Analysts Say Bitcoin’s Push To $100K Has Begun However, weakening volume or a drop below $1.48 may signal that SUI has formed a local top. For now, sentiment remains constructive as the token benefits from increased U.S. accessibility, improving technical signals, and expanding ecosystem activity.

    "title": "US Fed Has Ended Quantitative Tightening, But Why Is The Bitcoin Price Still Below $100,000?",
    "body": "The Federal Reserve has officially brought its multi-year quantitative tightening program to a close, freezing its balance sheet at about $6.57 trillion after draining more than $2.3 trillion from the system since 2022. The Federal Reserve’s decision to formally end quantitative tightening has created a sense of anticipation across the crypto market. Liquidity inflows have shaped every major crypto cycle, and removing the multi-year drain on liquidity is expected to set the stage for healthier crypto market conditions and see the Bitcoin price push above $100,000 in the coming days. Policy Shift Meets A Market Still Searching For Direction The Fed has frozen its balance sheet at roughly $6.57 trillion after three years of balance-sheet reduction. Treasury runoff has stopped on December 1, though mortgage-backed securities will continue declining slowly. Related Reading: Finance Expert Says Bitcoin Price Growth Is In ‘Google 2017’ Phase, What This Means Ending QT means that the Fed is stepping away from the rapid balance-sheet reduction that tightened financial conditions throughout 2023 and 2024. The move comes after bank reserves fell to levels that threatened short-term funding stability, and the Fed made the move to halt any further liquidity drain. Crypto investors are expecting the end of QT to relieve some of the selling pressure that has contributed to the crypto industry in recent months. This is due to historical comparisons of how the industry played out in previous ends to QT. In 2019, when the Fed last ended QT, digital assets bottomed within weeks and then entered a strong recovery phase. That period represented a decisive low for altcoins and preceded Bitcoin’s rise from roughly $3,800 to $29,000 over the next year and a half. Interestingly, the entire crypto market’s short-term behavior is starting to show signs of bullishness. Particularly, the entire market is up by 7.2% in the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin leading the charge. However, cryptocurrencies are facing a different macro environment today, and the outlook is whether Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can go on another extended bullish rally in the coming months. Why Is Bitcoin’s Reaction Delayed? Ending QT is a meaningful turning point, but it does not automatically flood the system with fresh liquidity. Benjamin Cowen, founder of IntoTheCryptoverse, offers one of the clearest explanations for what to expect. Related Reading: Financial Strategist Debunks Prediction That Bitcoin Price Will Reach $220,000 In 45 Days He noted that in 2019, the Fed announced QT would end on August 1, but the balance sheet continued falling through mid-August because previously scheduled Treasury maturities had not yet settled. It wasn’t until early 2020 that Bitcoin started to experience explosive gains. According to Cowen, the same dynamic applies now. Therefore, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet could continue edging lower for a few more weeks, meaning the first meaningful uptick in liquidity may not show up until early 2026. This delay suggests that traders hoping for an immediate boost or a quick return of Bitcoin above $100,000 are simply ahead of the cycle. The tightening phase has ended, but the actual recovery in liquidity has yet to begin. Featured image from Pngtree, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade Goes Live Today: Experts Predict Potential Supply Crunch Ahead",
    "body": "The highly anticipated Fusaka Upgrade for Ethereum is on the verge of going live on Wednesday, heralding significant enhancements to the network’s overall functionality. Analysts contend that this pivotal development could usher in a considerable supply crunch for ETH, potentially boosting its price during a challenging period for the broader cryptocurrency market. Layer 2 Solutions To Boost ETH Burn According to analysts at Bull Theory, the Fusaka Upgrade integrates components from previous upgrades—Osaka, Fulu, and PeerDAS—but its most impactful feature is its resolution of one of Ethereum’s biggest challenges. Layers 2 (L2) solutions have long utilized Ethereum’s security while contributing minimal fees back to the network. Despite L2 solutions like Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync generating millions in fees from users, the fees recorded on Ethereum tended to diminish to nearly zero when they posted their data. Consequently, this meant that significant L2 activity did not result in substantial ETH being burned, even though approximately 85% of Ethereum transactions now occur on these Layer 2 solutions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slump Claims New Victims: Leveraged ETFs Tied To Strategy Suffer Major Losses The Fusaka Upgrade fundamentally changes this dynamic. A key enhancement is EIP-7918, which mandates that Layer 2 transactions pay real fees to Ethereum. This adjustment ensures that every L2 transaction will contribute directly to the burning of ETH—something that was not previously guaranteed. The analysts assert that this feature represents one of the most significant value shifts since the introduction of EIP-1559. Post-Fusaka Projections The upgrade is further expected to broaden the scope of ETH burn from being predominantly derived from Layer 1 (L1) transactions to encompassing all L2 activity. Historically, most ETH burn has originated from mainnet transactions; thus, the network saw slight inflation in 2024–2025 as Layer 2s made transactions cheaper, leading to a decrease in ETH burn while staking continued to issue new ETH. Post-Fusaka, every L2 blob will incur a minimum cost, which will be burned. As Layer 2 adoption increases, the rate at which ETH is burned will also rise, contributing to increased scarcity of ETH. This enhancement positions Ethereum to shift back towards deflation for the first time in several years. Currently, ETH issues around 620,000 new tokens annually for stakers while burning approximately 350,000 tokens. This results in a net slight inflation. However, projections following the Fusaka Upgrade, even with conservative estimates, suggest that the additional burn from L2 activity could range from 200,000 to 400,000 ETH per year. Combined with existing burn rates, this could bring the total to over 600,000 ETH, leading to a net neutral or slightly deflationary state for ETH. More bullish models predict that if L2 adoption flourishes and demand for blobs rises, burn rates could soar to between 900,000 and 1.2 million ETH annually, resulting in a supply decrease of 200,000 to 300,000 ETH each year. Monetary Transformation For Ethereum? Another notable aspect of the Fusaka upgrade is PeerDAS, which enhances Layer 2 growth by reducing bandwidth requirements by 85%. This efficiency allows L2 solutions to publish more blobs at lower costs, resulting in increased fees and, consequently, more ETH burned. Related Reading: Analyst Says This Needs To Happen For The XRP Price To Rally Again The upgrade also increases the block gas limit from 36 million to 60 million, allowing more transactions to fit within each block. This increase means that more transactions can occur, leading to higher fees collected and a corresponding rise in burning. Furthermore, lower fees for transactions—such as swaps, bridges, on-chain gaming, and social applications—will likely drive more usage, resulting in increased transactions and higher ETH burn. Ultimately, the analysts believe that the Fusaka Upgrade represents a significant monetary transformation for Ethereum, indicating that the network is not only scaling but also beginning to monetize that scaling effectively.

    "title": "Tron Hits $80.2B Stablecoin Milestone After Tether Mints 1B USDT On The Network",
    "body": "the heldTron has emerged as one of the strongest performers during the latest market downturn, showing a level of resilience rarely seen among major altcoins. While most large-cap cryptocurrencies have suffered drawdowns of 40% or more since August, Tron has limited its losses to just 24%, outperforming nearly the entire altcoin sector. This relative strength highlights the network’s unique positioning and the steady demand it continues to attract despite broader market weakness. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidation Dominance Hits Multi-Year High: The Real Cause Behind BTC’s Breakdown A major factor behind this resilience is Tron’s growing dominance in the stablecoin ecosystem. According to data from Tronscan, shared by Lookonchain, Tether minted another 1 billion USDT on Tron, signaling continued confidence in the network’s ability to handle large-scale stablecoin issuance. This new mint has pushed Tron’s stablecoin market cap above $80.2 billion, solidifying its role as the leading chain for USDT circulation. As capital rotates defensively into stablecoins, Tron tends to benefit disproportionately. Its ability to maintain relative stability while the rest of the market capitulates reinforces the idea that Tron’s utility-driven demand remains intact—and may continue to offer support even if volatility persists. Tron Strengthens Its Position as the Second-Largest Stablecoin Network Tron has become a central pillar of the global stablecoin ecosystem, securing its position as the second-largest blockchain for stablecoin activity. Its appeal comes from fast settlement times, extremely low transaction fees, and deep liquidity—features that make it the preferred network for high-volume USDT transfers, especially across exchanges, OTC desks, and remittance corridors. This infrastructure has allowed Tron to attract massive stablecoin flows, with its total stablecoin market cap now exceeding $80.2 billion, largely driven by Tether’s continual issuance on the network. However, despite Tron’s remarkable growth, Ethereum still dominates the stablecoin landscape, maintaining a market cap of roughly $166 billion, which is nearly double that of Tron. Ethereum’s dominance is supported by its broader DeFi ecosystem, institutional presence, and the higher-value activity that takes place through smart contracts, lending protocols, and on-chain financial applications. Stablecoins on Ethereum often serve as liquidity for sophisticated trading and yield strategies, whereas on Tron, they are primarily used for settlement, payments, and exchange flows. The two ecosystems complement different market needs. Ethereum anchors the institutional and DeFi-driven segment of stablecoin usage, while Tron leads in high-throughput, cost-efficient transactions. As stablecoin demand grows globally, both networks continue to reinforce their positions. One through scalability and speed, the other through DeFi depth and capital concentration. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Cut In Half As $6.4B In Positions Vanish: Market Reset Accelerates TRX Holds Strong Weekly Structure Despite Volatility Tron’s weekly chart shows a notable level of resilience compared to broader market conditions. While many altcoins have experienced far deeper drawdowns, TRX has held above the $0.27–$0.28 support zone. Maintaining a strong higher-timeframe structure. The recent correction pulled the price down from the $0.36 region, but TRX continues to trade comfortably above the 50-week SMA. Which now sits around $0.28 and acts as immediate dynamic support. This strength is significant. Throughout 2025, TRX has respected its rising moving averages. The 50-week SMA in particular has provided consistent support during each market pullback. The 100-week and 200-week SMAs, positioned well below the current price, show a broad, healthy long-term uptrend that remains intact. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Distribution Continues: Whale Sends Another 5,000 ETH To Binance For Tron to regain bullish momentum, it must reclaim the $0.30–$0.32 region. Which served as support during the previous uptrend and now acts as resistance. A strong weekly close above this zone could open the door for a retest of the $0.34–$0.36 highs. Until then, TRX remains one of the market’s more stable performers, showing controlled downside and structural strength. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Chainlink (LINK) is once again in the spotlight across the cryptosphere after the launch of the first U.S. Chainlink-focused ETF sparked a sharp price rebound and renewed institutional interest. LINK surged more than 20% in 24 hours, trading around $14.4 as volumes and market participation accelerated. Related Reading: Can the Fusaka Upgrade Renew Ethereum’s Momentum After Recent Price Hit? Chainlink ETF Launch Sparks Strong Market Reaction Grayscale launched the GLNK ETF on December 2, converting its previous private Chainlink trust into a publicly traded product on NYSE Arca. The ETF opened with zero fees and recorded more than 1.17 million shares traded on its first day, far above historical averages. Trading volume reached roughly $13.8 million, while early inflows were reported near $43 million, reflecting strong initial demand. The ETF gives institutions regulated exposure to LINK without requiring direct token custody. With access through major platforms such as Fidelity and Robinhood, Chainlink is receiving increased visibility among traditional investors. Grayscale currently holds about 1.3 million LINK tokens through the product. Derivatives data also shows rising interest, with LINK futures open interest climbing more than 20% and funding rates turning positive as traders add long positions. LINK's price gains some momentum on the daily chart. Source: LINKUSD on Tradingview Technical Signals Point Toward Breakout Potential Beyond ETF-driven momentum, the LINK chart is drawing attention from technical analysts. Several analysts have emphasized a rare four-year descending wedge pattern, typically associated with long-term compression before a breakout. LINK recently bounced from the $12.50 support level, forming higher lows and regaining key Fibonacci levels. Momentum indicators are turning positive as well. The daily RSI has recovered to around 53, while MACD signals improving strength. LINK is now approaching the $14.96 Supertrend level and remains below the 50-day and 200-day EMAs, both key levels the market is watching for confirmation of a trend shift. If the token holds above $13, analysts expect a possible move toward the $18–$20 resistance range. A break above these zones could open the path toward the higher targets mentioned by long-term analysts. Year-End Targets Strengthen as Market Sentiment Improves Crypto analyst Ali Martinez notes that LINK is currently sitting on an important long-term support trendline, which could act as a foundation for a move toward $26 and potentially $47 if momentum continues. Rising institutional inflows, accelerating derivatives activity, and a new spot ETF creating a steady channel for capital have strengthened market expectations.

    "title": "XRP Open Interest Reset Could Put Bulls Back In Control As Price Targets $3",
    "body": "The last two months have seen a major reset in the XRP open interest, coinciding with the widespread sell-offs that have rocked the market. Looking at past performances, historical data suggests that this open interest reset could be a major break for the altcoin. As prices begin to see some recovery, the reset could present the perfect opportunity for bulls to reclaim complete control of the XRP price and drive it toward higher levels. How Far Has The XRP Open Interest Crashed? To know the scale of this reset, it is important to look at the XRP open interest numbers over the last few months. Data from Coinglass shows that back in July, the XRP open interest hit a new all-time high of $10.9 billion as market participation surged to levels not seen before. Related Reading: When Will Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Go Into A Bear Market? Coincidentally, this rise to new all-time highs coincided with the XRP open interest coming out of another period of reset, eventually leading the XRP price to reach new seven-year peaks. However, it wasn’t long until the bears came knocking once again, and the open interest tumbled as the price fell. For perspective, the open interest is the total of all XRP futures or option contracts. Effectively, this is a reflection of participation and the number of bets that traders are making on the cryptocurrency. Thus, the higher the open interest, the higher the amount of money invested in XRP derivatives, and vice versa. Presently, the open interest is sitting at a low $3.75 billion, representing an over 65% crash from its $10.94 billion peak. But this crash could be the reset that the altcoin needs for another recovery, especially as liquidity begins to flow back into the market on account of the US Federal Reserve putting an end to quantitative tightening. Can The Price Surge To New All-Time Highs? Earlier in the year, when the XRP open interest had crashed from its January all-time highs, the reset ended up resulting in higher prices. Although the XRP price didn’t break its 2018 record, it came close in July. However, going by this trend, the altcoin could have a while longer to go before there is a surge. Related Reading: You Won’t Believe How Much Bitcoin Companies Now Hold, What % Of Supply Do They Control? Following the crash in January, the XRP open interest had remained low for the next five months, with the price showing muted performance alongside it. With only two months since its last peak, the XRP open interest could trend low for a while longer before breaking out. However, if the trend holds, then the resulting rally would push the price above $3 once again. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Flashes 3-Drive Reversal As Bulls Eye Explosive Break Above $2.50",
    "body": "XRP is testing a key inflection zone above $2.00 as two independent frameworks from crypto analysts Dom (@traderview2) and Osemka (@Osemka8) converge on a potential reversal – with clearly defined levels at roughly $2.00, $2.22 and $2.50 marking the battlefield. XRP Price Consolidation Nears Its End On the higher-timeframe 2-day chart, Osemka frames the structure as a classic flat correction built on top of the 2021 high. “Here’s the range and levels to help you navigate it. We’re basing on top of 2021 high,” he writes, adding that “we’ve also never broken down after going sideways for this long, so I remain with my view of this being an accumulation range and a flat correction.” Related Reading: XRP Whale Wallets Collapse 20%, But Biggest Holders Hoard More Than Ever His chart shows XRP oscillating in a horizontal band whose floor aligns with the 2021 high, labeled as a “Reaccumulation” area. Price has repeatedly tagged this support and bounced, while midrange resistance in the low-to-mid $2 zone has capped multiple rallies. Above, a higher horizontal line marks the January spike, which Osemka treats as the cycle top. Internally, he maps an A–B–C corrective sequence. The B leg forms a dotted ascending channel, labeled as a 3-legged “abc” wave. “That dotted ascending range in the middle (3 legged abc wave in B) has me optimistic as that is a corrective move that is synonymous for a flat correction,” he explains. “Meaning the top was in January and this indeed is only a sideways correction.” The current C leg is contained within a downward “Corrective channel” pointing back toward the lower band. For Osemka, even a deeper test of support would not necessarily be bearish for the larger structure: “If we end up taking the lower end of the range with C leg it’ll remain to be seen. But if so, it’d be a great buying opportunity.” He also calls XRP “a perfect example on why I view BTC also as a flat correction with the top in January,” arguing that “while Bitcoin is messy, XRP is very clean.” Why Its Now Or Never For XRP Dom zooms in on the last six weeks of that broader range and focuses on the microstructure that could trigger a move back toward the upper band. “If you inverse the chart over the last 6 weeks, you’ll see a perfect 3 drive pattern, a very accurate reversal setup in crypto,” he writes. On the non-inverted chart, this corresponds to three downside pushes that fail to extend lower, followed by what he calls a higher low: “We can see a HL has finally formed which can hint at the first sign of a trend change developing.” His 8-hour chart highlights the monthly rolling VWAP as the key pivot. “Bulls needs to regain the monthly rVWAP around $2.22 and that would be the shift for a rally back towards ~$2.50,” Dom says. That ~$2.50 area aligns with higher VWAP clusters and the upper portion of Osemka’s range. Related Reading: XRP Price About $1,000 Is A Necessity, Analyst Claims Order-book and skew data back his view that conditions are ripe for a break if buyers step in. “Orderbooks are clear, if there was a time, it’s now for this trend to shift,” he notes, pointing to relatively clean liquidity overhead and a recovering skew after a washed-out short side. The downside is equally explicit: “If this setup fails, acceptance under $2 is next and the end of year is ugly.” That would mean a decisive loss of the long-defended support band built on the 2021 high and a deeper completion of the C leg in Osemka’s flat-correction structure. For now, XRP remains compressed between the $2.00 support, the $2.22 monthly rVWAP trigger and the ~$2.50 upside magnet, with the six-week 3-drive pattern and flat-correction range jointly defining one of the clearest technical inflection points on the XRP chart this year. At press time, XRP traded at $2.1798. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Stands At The Edge Of Explosion – Cup & Handle + IH&S Signal A Breakout Storm",
    "body": "Bitcoin is approaching a critical tipping point as two powerful bullish patterns, the Cup & Handle and the Inverse Head and Shoulders, align to signal a potential breakout storm. With momentum building and key resistance levels now within reach, the market is bracing for what could be a major explosive move. BTC Climbs Above 93,160 As Cup & Handle Targets 104,000 Charting BTC on the 4-hour timeframe, analyst Kamile Uray revealed that the price is currently moving above the $93,160 level. Uray is closely monitoring the price, as a successful close above this level would confirm the breakout of a recently formed cup and handle pattern. According to this classic pattern, a confirmed breakout targets the $104,000 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rallies Into Resistance With Traders Watching for Breakout Confirmation If BTC reaches the $104,000 target without forming a wicking reversal, it would also decisively break the falling blue trendline. Breaking both this trendline and the pattern target would provide strong evidence for the continuation of the overall uptrend. The analyst highlighted that the next major resistances are located at the $98,200 and $107,500 levels. A break above $107,500 and the falling blue trend on the daily chart will serve as the ultimate sign that the long-term uptrend is fully resumed. Uray suggests that retests after the breakout of the pink box ( the handle resistance area) can be evaluated as potential trade entries. The mandatory stop-loss for these trades should be placed at a daily close below the pink box, maintaining strict risk management. Conversely, should the price fail to hold the pink box, the immediate support zone to watch is the $83,822 – $82,477 region below. A bearish scenario is confirmed by a daily close below $82,477, signaling a continuation of the downtrend. In this case, the market would likely seek the next support zone at $74,496 – $71,237, which represents the previous top broken in November 2024. If this zone holds, a major uptrend reversal could be expected again. IH&S Pattern Confirms Reversal Momentum According to a recent update by Crypto VIP Signal, Bitcoin’s recent price action has confirmed a significant bullish reversal. The asset has successfully surpassed the $87,500 mark and has also broken through the key level of $90,000. This upward movement confirms that the Inverse Head and Shoulders (IH&S) pattern has acted as expected, triggering a strong trend reversal signal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders See First Uptick Since April Lows: Bullish Sign? The analyst noted that the current market structure appears strong because the price increase is being supported by healthy trading volume. With the reversal confirmed, Crypto VIP Signal noted that the next technical benchmark for the market is $95,000, and it will be interesting to see how the price behaves when it tests this resistance point.

    "title": "Risk Runs Hot: Massive Crypto Liquidation Wave Slams Traders Overnight",
    "body": "A sharp rise in crypto liquidations is sending a louder message of how some traders are using more leverage in recent months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trail Ends: $29M Seized After European Authorities Shut Down Cryptomixer Average daily wipeouts have jumped from roughly $28 million in long bets and $15 million in shorts during the last cycle to about $68 million long and $45 million short in the current cycle, according to a new Glassnode and Fasanara report. That shift has made single sell-offs much more violent. Early Black Friday Shock Reports have disclosed that Oct. 10 was the clearest sign of the change. On that day, more than $640 million per hour in long positions were liquidated as Bitcoin plunged from $121,000 to $102,000. Open interest fell about 22% in less than 12 hours, sliding from close to $50 billion to $39 billion. Traders felt the move fast. Positions were closed out on a scale Glassnode called one of the sharpest deleveraging events in Bitcoin’s history. Futures Activity Hits Records Futures markets have swelled. Open interest climbed to a record $68 billion and daily futures turnover topped $69 billion in mid-October. Perpetual contracts now account for more than 90% of that activity, which concentrates risk in instruments that reset continuously. Average daily futures wipeouts rising to $68 million long and $45 million short shows the costs when big swings occur. Spot Trading Doubles Based on reports, spot trading has also become more active. Bitcoin’s spot volume has climbed into an $8 billion to $22 billion daily range, roughly double what was seen in the prior cycle. During the Oct. 10 crash, hourly spot volume spiked to $7.3 billion, with many traders stepping in to buy the dip rather than run for the exits. That flow has helped shift where price discovery happens. Capital Flows And Market Share Monthly inflows into Bitcoin have varied from $40 billion to $190 billion, pushing realized market capitalization to a record $1.1 trillion. Roughly $730 billion has flowed into the network since the November 2022 low — more than all previous cycles combined. As a result, Bitcoin’s share of overall crypto market cap rose from 38% in late 2022 to 58% today, based on the report’s figures. Related Reading: $93K And Climbing: Analysts Say Bitcoin’s Push To $100K Has Begun Bitcoin As Settlement Rail Meanwhile, there’s another striking stat: over the past 90 days the Bitcoin network processed nearly $7 trillion in transfers. That throughput exceeded what major card networks handled in the same window. This has been cited as a reason some participants view Bitcoin not just as a store of value, but as an increasingly important settlement rail. Bitcoin Price Action At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $93,165, up 6.5% and nearly 7% in the daily and weekly timeframes. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "Solana started a fresh increase above the $135 zone. SOL price is now consolidating above $142 and might aim for more gains above the $145 zone. SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $135 and $140 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $140 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $143 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could extend gains if it clears the $145 resistance zone. Solana Price Gains Momentum Solana price started a decent increase after it settled above the $128 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL climbed above the $135 level to enter a short-term positive zone. The price even smashed the $140 resistance. The bulls were able to push the price above $142. The price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent upward move from the $123 swing low to the $146 high. Solana is now trading above $140 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $143 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near $145. The next major resistance is near the $148 level. The main resistance could be $150. A successful close above the $150 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $162. Any more gains might send the price toward the $180 level. Another Pullback In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $145 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $143 zone and the trend line. The first major support is near the $135 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent upward move from the $123 swing low to the $146 high. A break below the $135 level might send the price toward the $128 support zone. If there is a close below the $128 support, the price could decline toward the $120 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $143 and $135. Major Resistance Levels – $145 and $150.",

    "title": "US Sen. Lummis Hints At US Bitcoin Buy With ‘Franklin’ Meme",
    "body": "US Senator Cynthia Lummis has reignited speculation that the United States could move to materially increase its Bitcoin holdings, after posting a Bitcoin-themed image on X with the caption: “₿ig things coming for Franklin!” Lummis Revives Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Hype The image is drawn as a children’s book cover titled “FRANKLIN BUYS BITCOIN AND FINDS FINANCIAL FREEDOM.” At the center sits Franklin, a cartoon turtle in a backwards red cap and bandana, seated at a wooden desk. In front of him is a laptop emblazoned with the orange Bitcoin logo, clearly signaling that he is using Bitcoin-related software or services—most obviously, buying or managing BTC. Franklin’s eyes project bright “laser beams” at the screen, echoing the well-known “laser eyes” meme in Bitcoin culture. Related Reading: Bitcoin Blasts To $92,000, Liquidating $182 Million In Shorts On the desk lie physical coins stamped with the Bitcoin symbol, and a glass jar filled with more of these Bitcoin coins. The jar seems to function as a visual metaphor for saving and stacking sats over time. The subtitle “and finds financial freedom” explicitly connects Bitcoin accumulation with the idea of long-term economic sovereignty. Bitcoin-focused accounts immediately interpreted the post as a policy signal rather than a simple meme. Bitcoin Magazine summarized the moment as: “JUST IN: US Senator Cynthia Lummis hints at buying Bitcoin”. Bitcoin Archive went further, claiming: “JUST IN: US Senator Cynthia Lummis hints at a potential US Bitcoin buy. Senator Lummis has recently submitted legislation to have the US government buy 1 million Bitcoin.” Related Reading: Bitcoin And The 2026 Fed Shift: Expert Says Markets Aren’t Ready That reading is consistent with Lummis’ own public rhetoric. On November 5 she wrote via X: “I truly believe the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is the only solution to offset our national debt. I applaud @POTUS and his administration for embracing the SBR, and I look forward to getting it done.” Her legislation has pushed for a formal US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and explicitly contemplated the government holding up to 1 million BTC over time. The meme also lands after President Trump’s executive order from March this year establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve framework. While it has become very quiet around the topic, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently attended the opening of the Bitcoin bar PubKey in Washington. For many in the market, those developments, combined with Lummis’ latest post, suggest that concrete steps toward expanding US Bitcoin reserves may be progressing quietly in the background. So far, however, there has been no official confirmation of state-level Bitcoin purchases. For now, Franklin remains a symbolic turtle with laser eyes at a Bitcoin laptop—but in a market hyper-attuned to political signals, Lummis’ image is being read as the clearest hint yet that the United States could one day be the largest sovereign Bitcoin buyer. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $93,381. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",
