    "title": "Bitcoin Short Squeeze Flushes Out Late Longers as Funding Turns Negative: Classic Capitulation Signal",
    "body": "Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim the $90,000 level as selling pressure continues to dominate across the crypto market. The sharp decline from the all-time high has fueled growing speculation that the current cycle may have already peaked, with many analysts now calling for the beginning of a bear market. Sentiment has shifted rapidly, and fear is spreading as traders question whether the bullish structure has been permanently broken. Related Reading: Bitmine Scoops Up Another 28,625 Ethereum ($82.1M) as Market Bleeds – Details However, not everyone agrees with the bearish outlook. A segment of market participants still expects a rebound, arguing that the correction is part of a broader continuation pattern rather than the end of the cycle. These optimistic observers believe that higher prices could still unfold once selling exhaustion sets in. According to top analyst Darkfost, the recent price action reflects a notable behavioral shift in traders. He explains that investors who attempted to long the market throughout the correction have finally been squeezed out. Funding rates, which had remained elevated during the decline, have now cooled and even turned negative — a strong signal that sentiment has flipped. Darkfost notes that traders waited for Bitcoin to correct more than 30% before shifting aggressively into short positions, highlighting a delayed reaction that often appears near market inflection points. Funding Rates Flip Negative as Short Dominance Takes Over Darkfost explains that the latest shift in funding rates is more meaningful than it appears on the surface. He notes that traders often assume the neutral funding level is 0%, but that is not the case. Most exchanges — including Binance — embed an interest component of roughly 0.01% into the funding calculation. This means that when funding drops below 0.01%, it already reflects short-side dominance. Therefore, when funding turns negative, it signals an even stronger tilt toward aggressive short positioning. According to Darkfost, this marks a clear behavioral change among derivatives traders, suggesting that the market has transitioned from forced long unwinds to conviction-based short exposure. Historically, these shifts tend to occur only once a correction is already deep into its progression. Darkfost highlights that such funding transitions often reflect trader capitulation — where participants who fought the downtrend finally flip and attempt to follow momentum, but only after most of the move has already unfolded. This phenomenon has appeared in previous cycle retracements and has frequently coincided with late-stage bottoms. He adds that Bitcoin may now be entering a disbelief phase, where price begins climbing while shorts continue to pile in. If this dynamic persists, it could act as fuel for an upside reversal, especially if spot demand wakes up and liquidations pressure the short side instead.

The downtrend remains clearly defined, as BTC continues to trade below the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages, signaling persistent bearish momentum. The slope of these moving averages has turned downward, reinforcing the shift in trend structure. Despite the bounce, the recovery lacks strong volume support, which suggests that buyers have not yet returned with conviction. Related Reading: STH Panic Emerges as Bitcoin Crashes To $81K: Realized P/L Turns Negative For The First Time This Cycle The chart shows that previous support levels around $95,000 and $100,000 have now become resistance areas, making them key levels to watch for any attempted recovery. A failure to reclaim these zones could trigger renewed selling pressure and a retest of the recent lows. However, the wick below $80,000 indicates aggressive buying at the lows, which could signal that a short-term bottom is forming if buyers continue to defend higher lows in the coming days. Market sentiment remains fragile, yet the stabilization above $85,000 hints at a potential consolidation phase rather than immediate continuation of the decline. A sustained move above the 100-day moving average would be the first meaningful signal of regained bullish momentum. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "DOGE Turns Bullish: Fresh ETF Listing and Rising On-Chain Activity Triggers Dogecoin Breakout",
    "body": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is back in the spotlight after a week of explosive developments that have shifted market sentiment firmly into bullish territory. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s November Crash To Continue If This Level Isn’t Reclaimed, Analyst Warns The launch of Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF, along with rising on-chain activity and renewed retail enthusiasm, has combined to push DOGE into a breakout zone that analysts say could define its next major trend. As the broader crypto market remains volatile, Dogecoin is proving once again that its unique blend of cultural appeal and market structure can create outsized momentum. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Grayscale’s GDOG ETF Ignites Fresh Institutional Demand The biggest catalyst of the week is the debut of Grayscale’s GDOG, the first U.S. spot Dogecoin ETF, an unprecedented milestone for any memecoin. Listed on NYSE Arca with a temporary 0% fee for the first $1 billion in assets, GDOG offers regulated exposure to DOGE without the need for wallets or direct custody. Early inflows have already surpassed expectations, signaling significant institutional interest ahead of fierce competition from Bitwise, which is launching its own Dogecoin ETF, BWOW, later in the week. The ETF arrival comes as Dogecoin maintains its position among the top 10 cryptos, boasting billions in daily trading volume and a market capitalization rivaling that of established traditional companies. Analysts note that ETF access could unlock new capital from retirement accounts, advisory firms, and institutions that have been previously restricted from buying the asset directly, potentially reshaping DOGE’s liquidity profile. Dogecoin Price Momentum Builds as On-Chain Activity Surges DOGE’s price climbed over 2% to trade around $0.15, breaking short-term resistance as volumes exceeded $1.5 billion. On-chain data shows more than 1.5 million daily transactions, reflecting heightened network usage driven by low fees and rapid confirmation speeds. Technical indicators also reinforce the bullish turn, as the RSI has rebounded from oversold territory, while support at the $0.13 zone remains intact. Market watchers say a move toward $0.18 is possible if ETF inflows remain strong. The long-monitored $0.17–$0.16 support cluster remains the key downside zone that bulls must defend to maintain control. Memecoin Era Strengthens as DOGE Enters Regulated Finance Dogecoin’s ETF debut is more than a market event. It’s a cultural benchmark that cements the evolution of memecoins from online jokes to regulated financial instruments. With Grayscale securing first-mover advantage and Bitwise close behind, Wall Street has formally opened the door to a new class of assets powered by community identity rather than traditional fundamentals.

    "title": "Fear Surges, But Real XRP Holders Aren’t Shaken—Analyst",
    "body": "According to Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist, fear has crept back into the XRP market as the token trades under pressure. Prices slipped below the $2 mark and recently hit about $1.83 before a small rebound. Volatility has been sharp, and many traders are being pushed into quick exits. Related Reading: Bitcoin Creator Somehow Becomes ‘Poor’ By Losing $41 Billion Without Saying A Word Volatility Tests Investors Based on reports, XRP’s slide accelerated after a broad market crash in early October tied to tariff tensions between the US and China. That turmoil forced billions of dollars of liquidations across exchanges. Different platforms briefly showed very different lows — Kraken recorded $1.40 while Binance charts on TradingView showed a flash low at $0.76. Fear is back, and it always hits those who don’t understand what it means to hold XRP. Most won’t survive the engineered volatility ahead. The system shakes out the weak long before real valuation even begins. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 23, 2025 Those swings left behind gaps in liquidity, including a zone around $1.98 to $1.99 that traders are watching closely. Price action has been messy but not one-directional. XRP was trading around $2.22, up about 1.8% in the last 24 hours, and in another snapshot it was reported changing hands close to $2.24 amid a rebound. Over the most recent 72 hours, the token posted a rally of more than 18%, showing how fast sentiment can flip. According to Aljarrah, fear has returned, and “it always hits those who don’t understand what it means to hold XRP.” The analyst pointed out that a good number of people will fall before they could even make it and “survive the engineered volatility ahead.” The system, he said, “shakes out the weak” long before actual market valuation takes its course. History And Psychology At Work Analysts and market observers point to XRP’s stop-and-go history as part of the problem. In 2017, the coin lingered for months before surging roughly 70,000% and then dropping by as much as 95% at certain stretches. In 2024, it traded quietly for much of the year before jumping over 600% near year end. That pattern makes holding the token psychologically hard for many. People sell too soon, often right before big moves. Support levels are being watched closely. Reports list key buffers at $1.95, $1.75, and $1.60. On the upside, some analysts are projecting a rebound to $4 by 2026, with longer-range targets of $13 and $27. Those are forecasts, not promises, and they assume steady market conditions and continued interest. While $XRP jumped 17% in the last 72 hours, whales used the move to lock in profits, selling more than 180 million tokens. pic.twitter.com/t9aKQqTwQN — Ali (@ali_charts) November 25, 2025 Whales Take Profit Amid Rally And ETF Flows Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez said larger holders have been taking profits during the rebound. Whales holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP reportedly sold over 180 million tokens, trimming their balances to about 4.74 billion XRP. That kind of selling can add pressure even while the price is trying to recover. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sudden Volatility Jump Signals Options Could Be Calling The Shots—Analyst Institutional flows appear to be a counterweight. Based on reports, the Franklin Templeton and Grayscale XRP ETFs launched in the US yesterday and drew combined positive flows of $130 million on their first day. Net inflows into US XRP ETFs on Monday were placed at $164 million, a figure that helped absorb some of the selling and supported a more than 7% gain over 24 hours in some trading windows.

    "title": "Here’s Why Bitcoin Still Dominates As The Premier Store Of Value In Digital Assets",
    "body": "In the dynamic and often volatile landscape of digital assets, Bitcoin’s position as the premier store of value in the digital asset space remains firmly intact, even as the broader crypto ecosystem evolves. Its unmatched network strength, fixed supply, and resilient global infrastructure continue to make it the benchmark against all digital assets. Unmatched Network Security Keeps Bitcoin In The Lead Bitcoin remains the largest and most secure store of value in the crypto ecosystem, with a market capitalization surpassing $1.7 trillion and increasingly unmatched institutional adoption. However, analyst Ted has noted on X that the BTC base layer was never built for decentralized finance (DeFi). Related Reading: Historic Downturn: Bitcoin Nears Worst Weekly Performance In Over A Year Most of BTC’s capital sits idle and is unable to support the complex financial applications. This is where the BTCFi emerges, and it’s rising because it activates this dormant capital without forcing users or liquidity away from BTC’s security. Ted highlighted that Arch Network is a utility layer that enables the development of expressive rush in smart contracts directly to BTC for high performance. It offers real-time state management, true interoperability, and fast parallel execution, while remaining fully aligned with the BTC UTXO model. This ensures that all settlements and final state changes remain anchored directly to BTC for maximum security. The applications on ArchVM generate Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs for each batch of transactions, and BTC nodes verify those proofs on-chain; a design that enables fast trading, money lending, credit markets, and real-world asset (RWA) applications with the L1-level trust. Furthermore, Ted describes the Arch Network as aiming to become a core piece of the infrastructure pillar for the emerging BTCFi ecosystem. Bitcoin Stabilizes As Market Volatility Cools Off The cryptocurrency market is now showing signs of stabilization, positioning Bitcoin for a potential resurgence. According to CryptosRus, last Friday, BTC appeared to have firmly bottomed just above the $82,000 level, a crucial development that analysts are pointing to as a potential renewed market strength. While the selling pressure is fading, these key developments could trigger a near-term bounce for BTC.

The market might still experience a second weaker wave of selling pressure, which would mark the exhaustion of any remaining sellers, and shift the market towards the bulls. Fed rate cuts are surging, as the December cut probability is climbing back to 70%, fueling optimism for liquidity support. Furthermore, liquidity injection is possible, and market analysts are highlighting that the actions from the Fed could expand reserves, which have historically proven to be bullish for the crypto market. With selling pressure easing and policy tailwinds building, BTC’s climb may continue signaling a potential recovery. Featured image from Pngtree, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "Bitcoin price started a recovery wave above $88,000. BTC is now consolidating and might soon aim for a move above the $90,000 zone. Bitcoin started a recovery wave and climbed toward $89,000. The price is trading above $87,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $88,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it settles above the $90,000 zone. Bitcoin Price Eyes Upside Break Bitcoin price managed to stay above the $83,500 level. BTC formed a base and recently started a recovery wave above the $85,500 resistance zone. There was a move above the $86,000 resistance zone. The bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $92,872 swing high to the $80,595 low. However, the bears are currently preventing an upside break above the $90,000 zone. Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $88,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin is now trading above $87,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. If the bulls attempt another recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $88,200 level. The first key resistance is near the $89,000 level. The next resistance could be $90,000 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $92,872 swing high to the $80,595 low. A close above the $90,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $91,750 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $92,500 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $93,500 and $94,000. Another Drop In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $90,000 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $86,700 level. The first major support is near the $86,200 level. The next support is now near the $85,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $83,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $82,000, below which BTC might accelerate lower in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $86,200, followed by $85,000. Major Resistance Levels – $89,000 and $90,000.",

Ethereum started a recovery wave above $2,850 and $2,880. The price is trading above $2,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,950 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above the $3,000 zone. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price managed to stay above $2,750 and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to climb above the $2,800 and $2,850 levels. The bulls were able to push the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,058 swing high to the $2,620 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,950 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,840 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . It is also above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,058 swing high to the $2,620 low. If there is another recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $2,980 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,000 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,060 level. A clear move above the $3,060 resistance might send the price toward the $3,150 resistance. An upside break above the $3,150 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,220 resistance zone or even $3,250 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,000 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,920 level. The first major support sits near the $2,880 zone. A clear move below the $2,880 support might push the price toward the $2,800 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,740 region in the near term.

    "title": "Crypto Has Entered Late-Cycle Territory, Says Global Liquidity Veteran",
    "body": "Global liquidity specialist Michael Howell used an appearance on the Bankless podcast to deliver a clear, if uncomfortable, message for risk assets: the post-GFC “everything bubble” is ending as the global refinancing machine rolls over, and crypto is late in that cycle rather than at the start of a fresh one. Howell’s starting point is his own definition of liquidity, which diverges sharply from textbook aggregates like M2. “This is the flow of money through global financial markets,” he said. It is not bank deposits in the real economy, but “money that is in the financial markets… it looks at the repo markets, it considers shadow banking,” and “pretty much begins where conventional M2 definitions end.” On his Global Liquidity Index, weekly global liquidity was under $100 trillion in 2010 and now sits “just under $200 trillion” – a doubling in a decade and a half. Howell Flags Liquidity Peak What matters most to him, however, is not the level but the momentum of that liquidity. Howell has identified a remarkably stable 65-month global liquidity cycle that he interprets as a debt-refinancing rhythm. Capital markets, he argues, are no longer primarily about funding new investment: “Something like 70 to 80% of transactions… are debt refinancing transactions. They’re not about raising new capital.” Related Reading: Crypto Crash Is A Forced Crypto Seller Unwind, Glassnode Co-Founders In that world, “debt needs liquidity for rollovers but actually liquidity needs debt,” because roughly three-quarters of global lending is now collateral-backed. The result, as he puts it bluntly, is that “ironically it’s old debt that finances new liquidity.” To capture the systemic tension, Howell tracks a debt-to-liquidity ratio for advanced economies: the total public and private debt stock divided by the pool of refinancing liquidity. The ratio averages about two times and tends to mean-revert. When it drops well below that level, liquidity is abundant and “you get asset bubbles.” When it rises significantly above, “you start to see a stretched debt-liquidity ratio and you get financing tensions or refinancing tensions and you can see those basically morph into financial crisis.” Right now, he says, “we’re transitioning, unfortunately, out of a period that I’ve labeled the everything bubble,” a phase where liquidity was abundant relative to debt after repeated rounds of QE and emergency support. The COVID era deepened that imbalance by encouraging borrowers to “term out” debt at near-zero rates. “A lot of the debt that then existed was refinanced back into the late 2020s at low interest rates,” he noted. That created a visible “debt maturity wall” later this decade: heavy refinancing needs now coming due into a much tighter funding environment. Shorter-term, Howell is focused on the interaction between Federal Reserve liquidity operations, the rebuilding of the US Treasury General Account and growing stress in repo markets. SOFR, which “you’d actually expect to trade below Fed funds” because it is collateralized, has repeatedly traded above its normal range. “We’ve started to see these repo spreads blow out,” he warned, adding that “it’s not really the extent of these spikes… it’s really the frequency that’s the most important factor.” If trade fails and leveraged positions begin to unwind, “it’s going to turn quite ugly and that could be the start of the end of the cycle.” Related Reading: Crypto Markets Underestimate A Trump-Style Flood Of Rate Cuts: Expert Inside his four liquidity regimes – rebound, calm, speculation and turbulence – Howell places the US firmly in “speculation,” with Europe and parts of Asia in “late calm.” Historically, early and mid-upswings favor equities and credit, peaks favor commodities and real assets, downswings favor cash and then long-duration government bonds. LIVE NOW – The Real Crypto Cycle: What Happens When Global Liquidity Peaks Global liquidity veteran Michael Howell (@crossbordercap) joins to map out the “master variable” driving asset price: A 65-month global liquidity and debt refinancing cycle that underpins booms, busts,… pic.twitter.com/Ryl3fqHoYR — Bankless (@Bankless) November 24, 2025 The Impact On The Crypto Market Crypto, in his work, straddles categories. “Crypto generally behaves a little bit like a tech stock and a little bit like a commodity,” he said. For Bitcoin specifically, “about 40–45% of the drivers… are global liquidity factors,” with most of the rest split between gold-like behavior and pure risk appetite. On the popular notion of a hardwired four-year Bitcoin halving cycle, Howell is unconvinced. “I don’t really see any evidence of that four-year cycle,” he said, arguing that the 65-month global liquidity/debt-refinancing cycle is the more robust driver. With that cycle projected to peak around now, crypto looks “late stage in the crypto cycle. So it could be over but it might not be.” The structural backdrop, in his view, is unambiguous: “The trend towards monetary inflation… is slated to continue for another two or three decades at least.” Against that, he argues, investors “have to have” monetary-inflation hedges: “It’s not Bitcoin or gold. [It’s] Bitcoin and gold.” Tactically, though, he is cautious. “We’ve not turned bearish risk-off yet, but we are not bullish short-term,” he said – and suggested that upcoming weakness in risk assets might be “a good time to pick up some more” of those long-term hedges. At press time, the total crypto market cap was at $2.96 trillion. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "XRP is inching closer to a major turning point as fresh upward momentum collides with a developing, expanding diagonal structure. The recent impulse off support is starting to hint at a potential macro shift, raising expectations for a breakout-driven continuation if buyers can maintain control. Building Toward A Truncated Low: Market Structure Turns Complicated Hov recently highlighted a key shift in XRP’s structure, revisiting the outlook from the previous analysis where a potential push lower was expected to complete a truncated low. Since that discussion, XRP has dipped further, printing a new low on the line chart compared to the wick from the liquidity sweep. However, the movement into that low hasn’t been straightforward, carrying a structure that appears more complex than initially projected. Related Reading: XRP Price Continues Lower as Sellers Tighten Grip on Intraday Structure At first glance, the drop appeared to be a simple three-wave corrective pattern. But on closer inspection, Hov noted that a valid expanding diagonal count is also emerging. Despite the unusual structure, the price action off the most recent low is showing signs of strength. XRP is now developing a clearer impulsive move upward, which could be the early stages of the momentum needed to set up the high-probability C/3 wave trade that has been anticipated. This early impulse doesn’t yet confirm a full trend reversal, but it does reflect a notable shift in market aggressiveness. For now, Hov maintains a bullish leaning toward this support zone holding. As long as buyers continue defending this area, the probability of the reversal scenario increases. XRP Breaks Key Retracement Level As RSI Signals Growing Strength According to the latest update from TARA, XRP has successfully tapped the 0.5 retracement level while showing impressive strength on the RSI. That reaction alone hints at growing momentum beneath the surface. A break above this zone would shift the focus toward the next major target at $2.30, aligning with the crucial 0.382 level. Reclaiming that area would serve as a strong signal that XRP may finally be carving out a true bottom. Related Reading: XRP Price Pulls Back Slightly — Market Still Poised for Fresh Advance Despite this promising setup, confirmation of a new trend is still missing. Momentum is building, and price action is becoming increasingly impulsive, exactly the type of behavior typically seen at the early stage of a macro Wave 3. Another key factor lies outside XRP’s chart entirely. BTC has just reached its resistance zone around $88,300 and has not yet gained the strength needed to break through. This moment of hesitation is important because Bitcoin’s next decision will heavily influence XRP’s short-term direction. The market is extremely close to confirming its next major leg, and all eyes remain on how these critical levels react in the coming sessions.

    "title": "Capriole Founder Not Bearish On Bitcoin Despite Headwinds—Here’s Why",
    "body": "The founder of Capriole Investments says he “cannot be bearish” on Bitcoin, pointing to key indicators that remain inside green territories. Bitcoin Heater & NVT Are Both Inside Bullish Zones In a new post on X, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has shared a couple of indicators related to Bitcoin that could paint a picture different than what the crowd is thinking right now. Related Reading: XRP Jumps 7%, But Watch Out For Speculative Froth The first indicator is Capriole’s “Heater,” gauging the situation related to the derivatives market. The metric tracks the data associated with the entire sector, including perpetual swaps, futures, and options markets. When this indicator has a high value, it’s a sign that investors are using high leverage and have an extreme level of bullish positioning across the various derivatives markets. Now, here is the chart for the metric shared by Edwards that shows the trend in its value over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Heater has witnessed a plunge recently as the Bitcoin price has crashed, indicating a cooldown in sentiment on the different derivatives markets. The metric is now inside the green zone, which has historically facilitated at least local bottom formations for the cryptocurrency. The same signal also emerged alongside the bear market bottom back in November 2022. The other indicator that’s bullish on Bitcoin right now is the Dynamic Range NVT. The Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Ratio is a popular BTC metric that’s used for measuring whether the asset’s value (that is, the market cap) is fair compared to the network’s ability to transact coins (the transaction volume). When this metric has a high value, it means that the market cap is high relative to the transaction volume. Such a trend could be a sign that a correction may be due for the coin. On the other hand, a low value on the metric can suggest the cryptocurrency’s value may not be inflated relative to its volume, and thus, could potentially have room to grow. Capriole’s Dynamic Range NVT defines lower and upper bands for the metric, beyond which the asset may be considered underbought and overbought, respectively. As the metric’s name suggests, these bands are dynamic, meaning that they change with time and reflect the recent Bitcoin environment. From the above chart, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin NVT Ratio has declined below its lower band recently, implying the coin may be undervalued. The last time this signal appeared was during the bearish period earlier in the year. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $40,000? Signal Behind Past 60% Crashes Is Back “We have some big headwinds to resolve (like institutional selling), but I cannot be bearish with Heater in the deep green zone today + fundamental value across the board,” said Edwards. The analyst suspects BTC might climb higher for at least the coming week. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $87,000, down over 7% in the last seven days.

    "body": "Spot XRP Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) started the week surpassing most crypto-based investment products after the record debut performance of Grayscale and Franklin Templeton’s funds. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s November Crash To Continue If This Level Isn’t Reclaimed, Analyst Warns GXRP, XRPZ See Record Debut This week, the second batch of spot XRP ETFs went live, debuting with a record-breaking performance. Notably, Grayscale and Franklin Templeton launched their XRP-based investment products, recording over $60 million in net inflows each during their first day. On Monday, Franklin Templeton debuted the new XRPZ ETF on NYSE Arca, highlighting that “its established utility in facilitating cross-currency settlement has made XRP a central component of the growing digital payments ecosystem.” Moreover, Grayscale followed the same path as with its other existing crypto-based private trusts, converting its XRP fund into the publicly traded GXRP ETF. In a significant achievement, both funds broke Canary Capital’s XRPC record as the biggest ETF debut of 2025. As reported by NewsBTC, Canary Capital launched the first single-token XRP spot ETF on November 13, smashing the initial expectations of multiple experts. After clearing the last regulatory hurdles, XRPC debuted on Nasdaq with a total volume of $58 million. Ahead of its launch, senior ETF analysts predicted that the fund could surpass Bitwise’s BSOL, which previously held this achievement. After the first 30 minutes, XRPC surprised market observers with $26 million in volume, suggesting strong initial demand. Meanwhile, BSOL recorded an impressive volume of $10 million in the first 30 minutes of trading, surging to $33 million by the half-day mark. The investment product closed its debut with $57 million in volume, beating all 900 other launches of the year. According to SoSoValue data, Franklin’s XRPZ and Grayscale’s GXRP saw an impressive $62.6 million and $67.4 million on their launch day, surpassing Canary’s XRPC record and becoming the best debuts of any ETFs in 2025 so far. XRP ETFs Steal The Spotlight Besides the remarkable launch of Grayscale and Franklin Templeton’s investment funds, the XRP ETF category’s performance surpassed that of other leading ETFs on Monday, including those based on the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Canary Capital’s XRPC and Bitwise’s XRP ETF brought in $16.4 million and $16.4 million, respectively, amounting to a total of $164 million in net inflows for the whole category on November 24. This performance was followed by ETH ETFs, which recorded $96.6 million in inflows, led by BlackRock’s ETHA. Solana-based funds came third with $58 million in positive net flows, extending their 20-day streak with a total of $568 million in inflows, according to Farside Invest data. Related Reading: Financial Strategist Debunks Prediction That Bitcoin Price Will Reach $220,000 In 45 Days Notably, spot XRP ETFs have seen cumulative net inflows of $586.8 million, registering an eight-day positive streak and surpassing the total inflows of SOL ETFs. On the contrary, Bitcoin ETFs registered the worst performance among the leading cryptocurrency funds. The investment products continued their choppy November performance, starting the week with $151 million in outflows, led by BlackRock’s IBIT. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $2.18, a 1.6% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Monad (MON) Price Skyrockets 80%, Emerges As Best Performer Among Top 100 Cryptos",
    "body": "The Layer 1 blockchain Monad (MON) successfully went live on Monday, igniting a significant surge in its native token. Within 24 hours of its launch, MON emerged as the best-performing asset among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. MON Token Hits $0.045 All-Time High Last week, Monad’s token sale kicked off on Coinbase’s new token presale platform, gaining robust momentum by raising approximately $50 million. However, just 12 hours into the sale, that initial enthusiasm began to wane. The fundraising effort only accumulated $95 million of the ambitious $187 million target for Circle’s USDC stablecoin. Yet, once the Monad blockchain launched, investor interest reignited, leading to an impressive over 80% rise in the MON token’s value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Less Than 50% Chance Of Hitting $100,000 By December 31, Says AI Model According to CoinGecko data, this price surge elevated the token to a diluted valuation of about $4 billion. By consolidating its gains, MON has managed to stay above the $0.040 mark, reaching a market capitalization nearing $440 million. Notably, the token also hit an all-time high (ATH) of $0.045 earlier on Tuesday, showcasing the heightened demand for MON in the past day. This rally comes despite a broader challenging environment for the cryptocurrency market, where Bitcoin (BTC) has retraced more than 30% from its ATH of $126,000 set back in October, and Ethereum (ETH) has struggled above the critical $3,000 level. The mainnet launch was accompanied by the listing of the MON token on several cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini (GEMI). Monad Trading Performance Surpasses Hyperliquid According to data from DeFillama, excitement around the MON token goes beyond its price. The Monad blockchain has already processed over three million transactions from around 140,000 addresses, with developers deploying more than 18,000 smart contracts. Investors who participated in the token sale had the opportunity to sell their holdings immediately after the launch. However, Coinbase has issued a warning to discourage early selling, stating that those who choose to sell their tokens within the first 30 days may face reduced allocations in future token sales. This aims to prioritize genuine enthusiasts of the project over traders looking for quick profits. Related Reading: Solana Rebounds Strong as Massive ETF Inflows Reinforce $128 Support Zone Furthermore, trading volume for MON on the Solana (SOL) blockchain exceeded $87 million in just 24 hours, surpassing the trading volume on Monad itself. This performance outstripped that of Hyperliquid (HYPE) by 149% and positioned MON ahead of platforms such as KuCoin, Gate, Kraken, and Bitget, making Solana the fifth-largest venue by total trading volume across exchanges.

    "body": "Bitcoin suffered a sudden and deep drop in November, losing nearly a quarter of its value and wiping out over $1 trillion across the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sudden Volatility Jump Signals Options Could Be Calling The Shots—Analyst Whales Trim Positions Before Crash According to on-chain data from CryptoQuant, large holders played a central role. Wallets holding between 1,000–10,000 BTC pared back their stakes in the weeks leading up to the fall. Those big sellers took profits after the October rally, and in many cases selling was steady rather than panicked. When large players step back like that, market depth can vanish quickly. A quick overview of Bitcoin’s price decline shows prices slid from record highs above $126,000 in October to roughly $81,000 at the lowest point, before a partial bounce to $87k was recorded. Traders and funds were caught off guard by the speed of the move. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $87,086, up 1.5% in the last 24 hours. Retail Selling Added To Pressure Based on reports, small wallets also leaned toward safety. Holders under 10 BTC and groups up to 1,000 BTC reduced positions, removing another layer of potential buyers. Has Bitcoin Found Its Bottom? Cohorts Tell the Whole Story “BTC may have formed a local bottom, supported by a strong rebound and accumulation from: 100–1k BTC holders. >10k BTC holders. However, the crucial 1k–10k BTC cohort is still distributing, preventing a full… pic.twitter.com/dGU4CBD1Bw — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 25, 2025 Buying interest from casual investors was weaker than expected. Mid-sized holders — those with 10–100 and 100–1,000 BTC — did buy during the correction, and their activity helped slow the slide. Still, their buying power was not enough to match the large outflows. Futures Liquidations Intensified The Drop Reports show that futures market dynamics turned a correction into a crash. Over a 13-day stretch, long positions were forcefully closed out. That cascade removed bids and created a chain reaction of selling that pushed Bitcoin from around $105K down to $81K. Liquidations were heavy, and the selling pressure was compounded as each forced sale fed into the next. A Tentative Rebound Shows Life After the lows were hit, Bitcoin climbed back to about $87,500. This rebound has been taken by some as a sign that a local bottom might be forming. According to CryptoQuant, however, the recovery cannot be considered secure while the 1,000–10,000 BTC group keeps reducing holdings. The market’s health was being tested by who chose to sell and who chose to buy. Bottom Status Hinges On Whale Activity Market watchers say a true reversal needs selling from large wallets to stop. If those whales pause, mid-sized buyers might build a firmer floor and confidence could return. If selling continues, lower levels may be explored once again. The coming sessions will be watched closely by traders who want to see whether large holders change course or keep cashing out. Related Reading: Bitcoin Creator Somehow Becomes ‘Poor’ By Losing $41 Billion Without Saying A Word For now, the situation is simple and tense at the same time: prices have recovered slightly, but the structural weakness that allowed a 25% fall was exposed. Bitcoin could face further losses after its recent crash, if CryptoQuant’s data is anything to go by. Large holders have been taking profits, while retail investors have also been selling, leaving fewer buyers to support the market. Analysts say the next move will depend on whether these big holders continue selling or if mid-sized buyers step in to stabilize prices. Featured image from Vecteezy, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Best Crypto Presales to Buy as Metaplanet Ignores Losses, Takes $130M Loan for Bitcoin Dip",
    "body": "What to Know: Best Wallet Presale marries Fireblocks MPC-CMP security with a mobile-first UX, Upcoming Tokens portal, and fee discounts for $BEST holders. With over $17.5 million raised and dynamic staking rewards, Best Wallet positions itself as a serious contender in the multi-chain wallet race. Maxi Doge blends meme culture with structured trading competitions, a dynamic APY model, and a funded treasury to support long-term community growth. Remittix targets real-world remittances, combining CertiK-audited smart contracts, CEX listings, and broad fiat coverage to streamline cross-border payments. Bitcoin just printed one of its sharpest retracements of the year, shedding around 30% since notching fresh highs in early October. Instead of de‑risking, Tokyo-listed Metaplanet is doubling down, taking a $130M loan to buy even more $BTC and effectively leveraging its existing holdings. That kind of aggressive treasury strategy is bullish for Bitcoin’s long-term narrative but brutal for balance sheets tied too tightly to spot prices. A number of digital asset treasuries are now sitting on sizeable drawdowns and seeing the impact in equity volatility and governance pressure across the sector. For many investors, the message is simple: holding only $BTC on the corporate or personal balance sheet is a concentration risk. In corrections like this, capital often rotates toward high-conviction presales that can outrun Bitcoin on a percentage basis if the next leg higher plays out as expected. That’s where this current cycle looks interesting. Some of the best crypto presales in the market are not just meme-driven liquidity grabs; they’re building actual infrastructure in wallets, trading communities, and cross-border payments. Below are three presales and early-stage tokens that are catching this rotation, led by Best Wallet Presale ($BEST) , which is a direct play on the wallet layer of Web3. 1. Best Wallet Presale ($BEST) — The Next Gen Crypto Wallet If Metaplanet is the poster child for balance-sheet Bitcoin, Best Wallet Presale ($BEST) is a bet on the rails that everyday users actually touch. The project wants to capture 40% of the crypto wallet market by the end of 2026 by becoming the easiest, safest, most feature‑dense wallet on mobile. Instead of choosing between custodial convenience and clunky non-custodial UX, Best Wallet integrates Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP infrastructure for institutional-grade key management into a consumer-friendly, mobile-first app. Users can build custom multi-wallet portfolios across multiple chains, with a Rubic-powered DEX aggregator for best execution. Where it really differentiates itself in a risk-on presale cycle is discovery. The Upcoming Tokens portal curates early-stage launches and streamlines the presale participation flow, allowing you to access vetted early token opportunities directly from your wallet. That matters when investors are hunting the ‘next one’ without wanting to chase every Telegram link and sketchy landing page. You can dive deeper into the token’s fundamentals in this recent analysis. On the token side, $BEST holders get reduced transaction fees across the ecosystem and access to higher-yield options via a built-in staking aggregator. There’s an 8% allocation (800M tokens) reserved for staking rewards, with a dynamic APY based on a user’s share of the pool, and immediate staking is already live for presale buyers. Learn how to buy $BEST to start staking today. That mix is clearly resonating. The presale has already raised $17.5M with tokens at $0.026005, positioning Best Wallet among the cycle’s largest wallet-focused raises. For a longer-term view on where the token could trade post-launch, see this Best Wallet price prediction . If you’re comparing wallet plays in this drawdown, it’s worth digging deeper into how Best Wallet’s Fireblocks MPC-CMP stack and presale access machine could reprice the category. Learn more about Best Wallet Token. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) — High-Octane Meme Trading Community If Bitcoin leverage is moving off-chain into corporate treasuries, meme culture is still where retail tests its risk tolerance. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) leans directly into that with a ‘never skip leg-day, never skip a pump’ brand that wraps 1000x energy into a community-first meme ecosystem. Rather than just vibing on memes, Maxi Doge emphasizes trader identity. The project bills itself as a 240‑lb canine juggernaut representing the leveraged degen mindset, then backs it with holder-only trading competitions, leaderboards, and rewards designed to gamify high-conviction trading behavior without needing actual 1000x perpetuals. The tokenomics are tuned for engagement and runway. A Maxi Fund treasury supports liquidity and partnership deals, while a dynamic APY staking mode (currently sitting at 73%) rewards longer-term conviction in the community. That gives $MAXI more structural depth than the average meme coin that dominated earlier cycles. Money is noticeable here, too. The presale has raised $4.2M with tokens priced at $0.00027, a level that still leaves psychological room for the ‘many zeros’ meme crowd while funding real ecosystem development. To learn more, check out our guide on how to buy $MAXI. If you think culture remains the leading indicator for liquidity, Maxi Doge is an obvious candidate on the meme side of this rotation. For traders who want meme exposure that is explicitly built around trading competitions and treasury-backed expansion, Maxi Doge offers a differentiated angle versus yet another dog with no roadmap. Check out the Maxi Doge presale. 3. Remittix (RTX) — DeFi Rails for Global Crypto Remittances While Metaplanet borrows against BTC to stack more, another big use case for crypto remains unsolved at scale: making cross-border money transfers cheaper and faster without forcing users to care about gas fees or bridges. Remittix ($RTX) is an Ethereum-based DeFi project built specifically for crypto‑to‑fiat remittances. The protocol focuses on crypto-to-bank transfers with real-time FX conversion, allowing users to send from supported cryptocurrencies and have receivers receive fiat in their local bank accounts. Its mobile wallet reportedly supports 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies across more than 30 countries, positioning Remittix as a specialist remittance rail rather than a general-purpose DeFi wallet. Security and listings are already part of the story. CertiK has audited Remittix smart contracts , and the token has confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank, which can help with post-presale liquidity. The team has also lined up a $250K giveaway campaign around its Q3 2025 wallet beta launch, using incentives to bootstrap user adoption. In terms of capital raised, Remittix is one of 2025’s standout presales, reportedly pulling in over $24.5M and ranking as a top pre-launch token by volume. For investors looking beyond price action into real-world payment rails, Remittix offers a complementary thesis to wallet and meme plays: turning volatile crypto into local fiat with minimal friction. Learn more on the official Remittix site. Recap : As Metaplanet levers up on Bitcoin after a 30% drawdown, capital is rotating into high-conviction presales with clear narratives. Best Wallet Token , Maxi Doge , and Remittix each target different parts of the stack, with Best Wallet’s Fireblocks-powered, presale-focused app standing out as the most infrastructure-driven bet.

    "title": "Best Crypto to Buy After Bitcoin Whale Bets $2 Billion on Market Rebound",
    "body": "What to Know: Bitcoin Hyper uses a modular Bitcoin L1 + SVM L2 design to deliver high-speed, low-fee smart contracts secured by Bitcoin settlement. Presale-stage projects like Bitcoin Hyper and PEPENODE offer high-beta upside if whale-led Bitcoin accumulation evolves into a full risk-on altcoin cycle. PEPENODE’s mine-to-earn concept and tiered virtual node rewards add a game layer to the memecoin thesis ahead of the next meme rotation. Shiba Inu’s Shibarium, ecosystem tokens, and ETF inclusion show how meme-origin assets can evolve into institutional-facing Web3 platforms. Bitcoin whales just injected more than $2B into fresh BTC exposure, a bold move at a time when retail traders are still de-risking after months of chop, liquidations, and sideways boredom. For deep-pocketed players, this combination of capitulation and discounted pricing is exactly when the risk-reward flips back toward accumulation. We’re witnessing a notable divergence: smaller wallets are continuing to step back from spot and derivatives markets, while large addresses are quietly scaling in, and ETF flows are showing early signs of stabilizing. Historically, that rotation has preceded some of Bitcoin’s sharpest recovery phases, driven by a tightening of supply and a resumption of liquidity-hunting momentum once it returns. If that script repeats, it won’t just be BTC moving higher. When Bitcoin finds a base and pivots, it tends to pull high-conviction altcoins, early-stage infrastructure projects, and high-beta meme ecosystems up with it. The window before sentiment officially flips is usually when asymmetric bets hit hardest. Against that backdrop, three very different plays are emerging as early beneficiaries of a potential rebound, a mix that fits neatly into the current search for the best crypto to buy now : Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) with its high-speed Bitcoin Layer-2 narrative, PEPENODE as a mine-to-earn meme-infrastructure hybrid gaining traction, and Shiba Inu, which continues evolving into a more mature ecosystem with growing institutional recognition. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) — First Bitcoin Layer 2 With SVM Speed Bitcoin Hyper is pitching itself as the first true Bitcoin Layer 2, engineered to tackle three of Bitcoin’s biggest structural limitations in one shot: slow confirmations, high L1 fees during congestion, and the lack of native smart contracts. The solution is a modular architecture that keeps Bitcoin L1 for settlement while shifting execution to a high-speed SVM-powered Layer 2. Rather than forcing Bitcoin to behave like an all-purpose chain, $HYPER bolts Solana-grade performance onto Bitcoin’s security base. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine , developers can deploy fast, parallelized smart contracts that rival, and in some cases surpass, Solana on raw execution throughput, while still anchoring finality to Bitcoin. SPL-compatible tokens port natively to the L2, lowering the friction for projects migrating from the Solana ecosystem. For users, this opens the door to instant, low-fee payments in wrapped BTC, plus a full DeFi stack, swaps, lending markets, and staking protocols that Bitcoin has never supported natively. NFT platforms, gaming projects, and high-throughput dApps can be built using a Rust-based SDK designed for teams already familiar with Solana tooling but who want Bitcoin’s monetary premium and credibility. On the market side, demand has been unmistakable. The Bitcoin Hyper presale has crossed $28.5M raised, with tokens priced around $0.013335, putting it firmly on the radar of early infrastructure investors, especially those now searching for how to buy $HYPER before the next stage unlocks. Two high-net-worth wallets accumulated roughly $396K in recent weeks, including a single $53K buy , the kind of early whale activity that typically signals conviction, not speculation. Staking activates from TGE with high-APY rewards (41% currently), instant access for presale participants, and a short 7-day vesting window. And for anyone still asking what Bitcoin Hyper is , the reward model is designed to scale with both capital staked and ecosystem participation, nudging holders toward long-term alignment rather than short-term flipping. You can join the $HYPER presale here. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) — A Mine-to-Earn Memecoin Built on Node Economics For investors who want meme exposure without relying purely on virality, PEPENODE takes a different route. It blends meme culture with mine-to-earn mechanics, giving holders an actual system to participate in rather than a passive buy-and-pray model. Users operate virtual nodes, level them up, and earn tiered rewards based on engagement, creating a structure that feels closer to early Bitcoin mining culture, just gamified for the modern meme cycle. The setup is simple but effective: a dashboard tracks your virtual mining activity, while a tiered node system determines how much of the emissions or rewards you capture. Higher-tier nodes earn more, meaning early entry and consistent participation can potentially unlock larger upside. It’s a memecoin, but with a built-in engine that rewards activity instead of pure hype. On the fundraising front, the presale has already pulled in over $2.2M, with tokens priced at $0.0011638, modest compared with major infrastructure plays but strong for a narrative-driven meme project still in distribution. Our $PEPENODE price prediction suggests it could reach $0.0077 by the end of 2026 if the mine-to-earn narrative gains traction. And with whales positioning for a broader market rebound, even small capital inflows into meme-adjacent experiments can trigger big percentage moves. There’s no formal staking program yet, which makes PEPENODE a pure speculation and gamified-yield play rather than a yield-maximization platform. But that’s also the appeal: if mine-to-earn catches fire with retail during the next meme rotation, token prices don’t need to move far to generate outsized returns. Explore the PEPENODE presale here. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB) — A Meme Brand Turning Into a Full Web3 Stack Shiba Inu (SHIB) may have launched as a pure meme, but it has steadily transformed into a broad Web3 ecosystem spanning DeFi, payments, and infrastructure. The backbone of that evolution is Shibarium, the project’s EVM-compatible Layer 2 designed for low-cost, high-throughput transactions. By offloading activity from the Ethereum mainnet, Shibarium gives the Shiba ecosystem room to scale while preserving its connection to the wider EVM universe. The ecosystem now stretches well beyond SHIB. Tokens like BONE, LEASH, and TREAT support governance, liquidity incentives, and additional utility layers, while ShibaSwap provides the DeFi foundation for swapping, liquidity pools, and yield tools. A pipeline of privacy-enhanced smart contracts and broader Web3 modules adds to the long-term ambition: converting one of crypto’s largest communities into a functioning, self-sustaining platform. Institutional validation has also started to crystallize. On October 22, 2025, Shiba Inu appeared in T. Rowe Price’s proposed US SEC–filed Active Crypto ETF, marking one of the clearest signals yet that major asset managers view SHIB as more than a meme; they see it as a liquid, brand-strong asset suitable for traditional investment products. For investors, that combination, a sticky global community, a working Layer 2, a growing dApp stack, and early ETF exposure, positions SHIB as a more conservative meme-side allocation compared with presale-stage tokens. It may not move like a microcap, but it can serve as a solid satellite position if a broader altcoin rotation follows the whales’ $2B Bitcoin bet. Learn more on the official Shiba Inu site. Recap: Bitcoin whales are leaning into a rebound with more than $2B in fresh exposure, and that kind of conviction has historically spilled into high-upside altcoins. In this setup, Bitcoin Hyper , PEPENODE , and Shiba Inu each tap a different angle of the opportunity, Bitcoin Hyper as the pure infrastructure play bringing Solana-level speed to Bitcoin, PEPENODE as a high-beta mine-to-earn meme experiment, and SHIB as the established ecosystem now earning institutional attention. For those positioning early, the $HYPER and PEPENODE presales offer the most asymmetric setups while SHIB serves as the steadier ecosystem anchor.

    "title": "Kevin Hasset Takes Pole Position for Future Fed Chair, Best Wallet to Benefit?",
    "body": "What to Know: A Hassett-led Fed under a Trump administration could mean earlier rate cuts and a more tolerant crypto stance, boosting risk-asset demand globally. Wallets sit at the front line of any new adoption wave, but many incumbents remain either highly centralized or overly complex for retail users. Best Wallet targets these gaps with MPC-secured, mobile-first UX plus tokenized perks, aiming for 40% global crypto wallet market share by end-2026. If US policy genuinely softens, infrastructure tokens tied to wallets, on-ramps and aggregators may see renewed interest alongside large-cap Layer-1 assets. Kevin Hassett stepping into pole position as President Donald Trump’s preferred candidate for the next Fed Chair is more than a personnel story; it’s a regime shift signal. That’s because Kevin Hassett isn’t a neutral party. He’s strongly pro-crypto, a stakeholder in Coinbase, and has gone on record as wanting to cut rates now. Analysts are excited, and markets are already gaming out a tilt toward earlier rate cuts, looser dollar liquidity, and a friendlier stance toward digital assets and financial innovation. For crypto, that combination typically acts as rocket fuel. Lower real yields reduce the opportunity cost of holding volatile assets like Bitcoin and Ether, while a less hostile regulatory tone lowers headline risk for exchanges, stablecoins and token issuers. If you’re already positioned in crypto, you’re effectively front‑running a potential pivot in US monetary and regulatory policy. But cheaper liquidity alone doesn’t onboard the next 100M users. What actually determines whether new capital sticks is infrastructure: wallets, ramps and applications that feel safe, intuitive and rewarding for everyday users, not just DeFi natives. That’s where the next competitive cycle is likely to play out if a Hassett-led Fed normalizes the macro backdrop. In that context, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is positioned as a bet on the wallet layer rather than just another speculative token. The Best Wallet app aims to pair institutional‑grade security with mobile‑first UX and presale access, pitching itself as a gateway product for the next wave of mainstream adoption if regulatory clouds clear. As the macro narrative evolves, you’re likely to see more attention on which wallet ecosystems can actually capture and retain this inflow. That shift from trading coins to owning rails puts projects like Best Wallet in a very different category than short‑cycle meme coins or one‑off DeFi farms. How A Hassett Fed Could Reshape Crypto Wallet Demand If Hassett does take the chair, markets would likely price in a faster path to policy easing and a softer line on digital assets. That combination historically correlates with higher trading volumes, exchange sign‑ups, and first‑time wallet downloads as retail traders re‑enter the market looking for beta. Most of those newcomers won’t start on hardcore DeFi. They’ll land in retail‑friendly wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet or Coinbase Wallet, which act as default gateways. Yet these incumbents either lean heavily centralized, with KYC and recovery tied to a single provider, or remain clunky for mobile‑first users who expect a Web2‑grade experience. This is the opening innovative wallet ecosystems like Best Wallet are chasing. The Best Wallet Token presale enters this crowded field trying to solve for security, UX and upside participation in one stack, rather than forcing you to choose. Why Best Wallet Token Is Leaning into the Next Cycle Where many wallets simply custody assets and route swaps, Best Wallet Token is trying to build an integrated environment for what a more permissive US policy regime might unleash. The project’s core claim is ambitious: capture up to 40% of global crypto wallet market share by the end of 2026 by offering the easiest, safest and most feature‑rich mobile experience. On the security side, Best Wallet plans to be the first fully integrated Fireblocks MPC‑CMP wallet in the retail segment, bringing institutional‑grade multi‑party computation to everyday users. In practice, that means key material is split across multiple parties and devices, removing the single private‑key failure point that has plagued traditional non‑custodial wallets for a decade. Beyond security, the wallet leans into discovery and execution. A built‑in Upcoming Tokens portal is designed to simplify presale participation by curating and vetting early‑stage opportunities, while a Best DEX aggregator – powered by Rubic – routes trades across 200+ DEXs and 20 cross‑chain bridges. That’s aimed squarely at the cross‑chain fragmentation you probably feel every time you move between ecosystems. The $BEST token underpins this ecosystem with real utility: reduced fees inside the Best Wallet stack, boosted yields via a staking aggregator, governance rights, and preferential access to curated presales. The presale has already raised $17.5M, with tokens currently priced at $0.026005 and staking at 75%, suggesting growing demand for exposure to the wallet layer of the stack. To join in, discover how to buy $BEST. On‑chain data shows significant whale transactions (as verified on-chain), including one of $70.2K. This hints at the fact that some smart money is positioning early around the thesis that wallets, not just Layer-1s and Layer-2s, could be prime beneficiaries of a friendlier US policy environment. If you share that view, this cycle may be less about chasing every new token and more about choosing the right rails. That cycle could benefit $BEST incredibly – our $BEST price prediction sees the token potentially reaching $0.05106175 by the end of 2026. Research, then decide whether $BEST fits your risk profile. But hurry – the Best Wallet Token presale closes in less than two days. 🚀 Join the $BEST presale while you still can.

    "title": "Next Crypto to Explode? 2 Days Left of Best Wallet Token’s $17.5M Presale",
    "body": "What to Know: Today’s crypto wallets often force a choice between custodial risk or clunky non-custodial UX, with limited benefits beyond basic storage and transfers. Best Wallet offers access to 330 DEXs across 30 bridges in a non-custodial ecosystem and plans several future features, including the Best Card. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) raised over $17.5M in presale and only has two days left on the clock before $BEST hits exchanges. $BEST could deliver a 95% ROI by 2026 if you invest today, possibly more if investors rally behind Best Wallet. Crypto wallets are quietly becoming one of the most important battlegrounds in Web3. As on-chain activity spreads across dozens of networks and use cases, users aren’t just asking for a place to park coins anymore – they want secure, mobile-first hubs that unlock trading, yield, and payments in a single experience. At the same time, the current wallet landscape is stuck in a trade-off. Centralized wallets introduce counterparty and KYC risk, while many non-custodial options feel clunky on mobile, offer little beyond send/receive, and make presales or cross-chain swaps painful for everyday users. That gap is where Best Wallet is positioning itself. The project is pitching $BEST as the utility token behind a next-gen, all-in-one wallet that blends institutional-grade security with real user perks. Instead of just storing assets, Best Wallet is designed to help you discover new presales, move across 330 DEXs and 30 bridges via an integrated DEX aggregator, and earn yield through staking and fee discounts inside its ecosystem. With the presale entering its final stretch and only two days left of early pricing, attention is turning to whether this could be one of the next crypto to explode . Best Wallet Targets the All-In-One Crypto Super App Best Wallet aims to become the easiest and safest way for any crypto user to manage their portfolio, not just hold a handful of tokens. The mobile-first wallet wraps non-custodial, no-KYC access around a clean UX, custom multi-wallet portfolios, and targets 40% of the crypto wallet market by the end of 2026. Under the hood, the project leans on Fireblocks MPC-CMP key management while adding a DEX aggregator powered by Rubic, routing trades across 330 DEXs and 30 cross-chain bridges to help users source better pricing and lower slippage. Unlike legacy wallets that stop at basic swaps, Best Wallet layers in real perks like reduced fees for $BEST holders and higher APY rewards via its staking aggregator. Holds also get benefits like governance rights and early access to trusted presales before they catch steam. In terms of raw numbers, the presale is riding the highest waves. Buy $BEST today before the presale ends. $BEST Presale Numbers, Prediction, and Market Potential $BEST has raised over $17.5M in presale so far with a price of $0.026005, which already places it among the best presales of 2025. If the project captures just 5% of the global crypto wallet market, $BEST could peak fast. A realistic price prediction for $BEST , based on the wallet’s scope and utility, puts the token at $0.05106175 by the end of 2026. A sustained bull market could bring it to $0.07 by 2030, possibly higher if Best Wallet sees mainstream adoption. That translates to ROIs of 96.4% and 169% respectively, if you invest today. These are just estimates, of course, because $BEST has no theoretical upper limit; mainstream adoption and successful implementation could catapult the token beyond the highest expectations. If this sounds like something you’d like to back, read our guide on how to buy $BEST today. With just two days until the final presale phase closes, the window for early pricing is rapidly narrowing. Best Wallet’s pitch is simple: a single app where you can store, trade, stake, and access vetted presales, backed by a token that powers fee discounts and ecosystem rewards. Snag your $BEST for less while you still can. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR and manage risks wisely before investing.

    "title": "Texas Drops $10 Million On Bitcoin, Officially Buying The Dip First",
    "body": "Texas has moved public money into Bitcoin exposure, buying $5 million worth of shares in a regulated Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Related Reading: Bitcoin Creator Somehow Becomes ‘Poor’ By Losing $41 Billion Without Saying A Word According to reports, the state’s purchase was made on November 20, 2025, and it used the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to gain price exposure without immediately holding the cryptocurrency itself. The state set aside a total allocation of $10 million for its new Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Lee Bratcher, who leads the Texas Blockchain Council, confirmed the state’s crypto purchase on X. State Uses ETF As Interim Step Reports have disclosed that officials chose the ETF route as a temporary measure while the state puts custody plans in place. The IBIT shares give Texas a stake that tracks Bitcoin’s market moves. Based on reports, the entry price equated to roughly $87,000 per BTC at the time of the buy. The buy represents half of the total allocation, leaving $5 million still available for future moves. TEXAS BOUGHT THE DIP! Texas becomes the FIRST state to purchase Bitcoin with a $10M investment on Nov. 20th at an approximately $87k basis! Congratulations to Comptroller @KHancock4TX and the dedicated investments team at Texas Treasury who have been watching this market… pic.twitter.com/wsMqI9HrPD — Lee ₿ratcher (@lee_bratcher) November 25, 2025 The move follows legislation passed earlier in the year. According to public records, the reserve program was created by Senate Bill 21, signed in June 2025. The law authorizes a capped budget for the reserve and sets conditions for what assets qualify. Reports have disclosed that Bitcoin met the criteria laid out in the measure, prompting the initial allocation. What Officials Say And What Comes Next According to state officials, the purchase is meant as a hedge and a way to diversify long-term holdings. An RFP process is expected to pick a custodian, with officials planning to transfer from ETF positions to direct custody once systems are ready. The request for proposals is slated for early 2026, based on public statements. Analysts noted the distinction between ETF shares and direct ownership. ETF holdings provide price exposure; they do not give the state direct control over on-chain Bitcoin wallets. That control would come only after the state completes its custody procurement and shifts assets into cold storage or similar solutions. Possible Broader Effects Market observers say the purchase is notable because it marks one of the first instances of a US state formally placing public funds into Bitcoin exposure. The amount is small relative to broader markets, yet symbolic. It may prompt other states to consider similar reserve strategies, especially where lawmakers favor diversification. Related Reading: Hamas Victims Sue Binance And CZ — Accusations Of Terror Financing Rock Crypto World Transparency And Oversight According to public filings, the state will publish details of the holdings and any custody plan updates. Oversight mechanisms built into the law require regular reporting, and the remaining $5 million allocation must follow the same rules before it is used. That reporting will be watched closely by lawmakers, taxpayers, and market watchers. The buying decision was made amid wide debate over how government bodies should handle crypto assets. Texas plans to move carefully, using regulated products first and then moving toward self-custody when the proper safeguards and vendors are chosen.

    "title": "Dogecoin Coils For A Monster 90% Breakout, Analyst Predicts",
    "body": "Dogecoin is trading inside a well-defined falling wedge on the 12-hour chart, with one technical analyst arguing that an upside breakout could trigger an 80–90% rally into the upper $0.20 range. In a fresh DOGE/USDT update shared on November 25, 2025, trader Clifton Fx (@clifton_ideas) posted a Binance 12-hour chart that spans back to late July. Dogecoin Could Rally Nearly 90% The chart is dominated by two descending trendlines that enclose price action. The upper boundary connects successive lower highs from early autumn through late November, forming a downward-sloping resistance line now running just above the latest candle around the mid-$0.15 area. The lower boundary links the major swing lows since August, creating a shallower descending support line currently located in the high-$0.12 to low-$0.13 zone. Together they form the falling wedge that Clifton highlights in his caption: “Falling wedge formation in 12h timeframe.” Within this structure, Dogecoin has produced a series of lower peaks and troughs. The October 10 sell-off is marked by a prominent red candle and a thin vertical guide, driving price into the lower boundary before a partial recovery. Through late October and November, DOGE continues to respect the wedge: every rebound stalls beneath the upper trendline, while the sell-offs find support near the lower one. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bull Run Rests On This One Price Level, Analyst Warns In mid-November, price again tests that lower boundary, with a wick reaching slightly below the $0.13 region. From there, several consecutive green candles carry DOGE back up toward the upper trendline. The latest candle in the chart is closing in to that resistance, but no clear 12-hour close above it is visible, meaning the wedge remains intact and unbroken in the screenshot. On the right side of the chart, Clifton Fx plots an upside scenario. A tall, translucent green projection box starts at the current price line near $0.15181. A measurement label attached to the box reads “0.12237 (81.14%) 12,237”, indicating a move of $0.12237, or 81.14%, from that starting point. The top of the green zone aligns just above $0.27000 and below $0.28000, implying a potential target around $0.27. Related Reading: What Happens If Dogecoin Moves Out Of This Massive Wyckoff Accumulation? Summarizing the setup, the analyst writes: “In case of an upside breakout we can see an 80 – 90% massive bullish rally in the next coming days.” The chart itself, however, is explicitly conditional: the upper wedge line has not yet been broken, and no invalidation level is drawn. For now, Dogecoin is compressed between descending resistance near $0.15 and support above $0.13, with Clifton Fx warning that a clean breakout could quickly reprice DOGE toward the high-$0.20 area. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.14988. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Warning: XRP Price Is Forming A Death Cross That Previously Led To A 15% Crash",
    "body": "The XRP price is currently at risk of a crash as crypto analyst Umair has revealed that the altcoin has formed a death cross. Notably, this same pattern formed the last time that XRP suffered a 15% crash. XRP Price At Risk With Death Cross Forming In an X post, Umair stated that a death cross was forming on the daily chart for the XRP price. He further noted that the last time the altcoin printed this setup, it crashed by 15%, which, the analyst said, lines up perfectly with a potential decline to the $1.50 range. As such, he suggested that XRP could face the same outcome, since the same ingredients have formed. Related Reading: XRP Price Will Climb Above $10 When This Happens: Analyst Umair also mentioned that the chart was building a tight range between $1.90 and $2.08, a range which he described as the entire decision maker. He explained that if the XRP price can stay inside this band and spend time there, then it could form a month-long consolidation needed for a real base. However, if the XRP price fails to hold this range, then there is nothing stopping it from crashing to the $1.50 zone, according to the crypto analyst. He noted that this is exactly where the previous breakdown logic pointed. He also raised the possibility of another scenario playing out for XRP. Umair stated that if the XRP price wicks below $1.82 but snaps back inside the $1.90 and $2.08 range, then that could mark the bottom. However, if the altcoin closes below this range, then the range loses integrity, and XRP could begin its freefall. It is worth mentioning that XRP had dropped to as low as $1.8 last week but has since reclaimed the psychological $2 level. $1.65 Could Mark The Bottom For XRP Crypto analyst CasiTrades has predicted that the macro .618 support near $1.65 is likely to mark the bottom for the XRP price. This came as she noted that the altcoin was seeing a relief bounce for subwave 4. The analyst added that she expects XRP to backtest the $2 or $2.09 resistance before heading down to complete the final wave of this correction at $1.65. Related Reading: Pundit Reveals Why XRP Price At $1,000 Is Not A Dream – ‘It’s Math’ CasiTrades noted that this aligns extremely cleanly with Bitcoin. She explained that the BTC price came close to its own macro .382 retracement but hasn’t fully made it yet. The analyst expects BTC to finish its correction at $80,000, as XRP price makes its last move to $1.65. Once those levels are hit, CasiTrades expects the structure to flip bullish fast. The analyst predicts that Bitcoin will begin its Wave 5 into new highs while the XRP price and other altcoins kick off their macro Wave 3. She declared that they will begin their move together, but with different strengths because they are in different positions in the broader market cycle. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.17, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Peakpx, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "XRP 100x Rally To $225: Why The Only Place To Go Is Up",
    "body": "XRP may be positioned for a major rally that reshapes its broader market outlook. In a detailed analysis shared on X, crypto strategist Chad Steingraber outlines calculations showing how expanding ETF activity could set the stage for a 100-fold move, pushing XRP toward $225 per token. His commentary consolidates a series of demand-and-supply assessments that map the structural forces he believes define XRP’s potential rally, signaling a market phase increasingly driven by institutional participation. Mapping XRP’s Path To A 100x Rally At $225 According to Steingraber, XRP’s path to $225 follows a series of milestones. He projects a fivefold rise to $11.25, tenfold to $22.50, twentyfold to $45, fortyfold to $90, sixtyfold to $135, and ultimately a 100-fold increase to $225. Each step reflects the interaction between supply absorption and price adjustment: as ETFs acquire more XRP, price rises, moderating the rate of accumulation and maintaining balance in the market. In Steingraber’s view, the only outcome is a sharp rise in XRP’s price. Related Reading: Attack On Cardano Founder Leads To Network Halt, What Really Happened? While XRP’s current market performance shows a 1.8% decline over 24 hours and an 8.4% decline over two weeks, Steingraber emphasizes that these short-term fluctuations are minor compared to structural forces. ETF-driven demand and institutional acquisition are poised to create a supply-demand imbalance that pushes XRP far beyond its current trading range. Overall, his analysis frames XRP’s potential 100x rally to $225 as a structural outcome of institutional participation, ETF inflows, and supply scarcity. Price increases are essential to slow the rate at which asset managers acquire the token, making the rally a logical response to market mechanics rather than a speculative prediction. How ETF Inflows Shape XRP’s Supply Dynamics Steingraber’s series of projections illustrates how XRP could be absorbed at a pace capable of significantly reducing its circulating supply within a short period. Under conservative estimates of $33.6 billion in annual inflows, he believes that most of the available XRP could be acquired within a year. More aggressive scenarios involving major asset managers such as BlackRock could see the entire circulating supply absorbed in less than six months. Related Reading: Will The Low XRP Price Force Ripple To Dump Its Holdings? Exec Answers Community To illustrate the scale of demand, he breaks down current acquisition rates: seven major funds are taking in an average of $20 million per day each, totaling $140 million daily, $700 million weekly, and $2.8 billion monthly, amounting to $33.6 billion annually. At XRP’s current price of $2.20, these inflows would allow institutions to accumulate massive quantities of the token, creating rapid scarcity. This dynamic makes a substantial price increase unavoidable, as higher prices slow accumulation under fixed allocations and prevent ETFs from depleting the market too quickly. XRP’s rising price is therefore not just a market reaction but a structural requirement to maintain balance amid large-scale institutional buy-ins.
