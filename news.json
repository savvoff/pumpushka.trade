    "title": "Why Buying Cardano (ADA) Here Could Mean Weeks Of Dead Money",
    "body": "Cardano’s (ADA) current price may look tempting, especially as it sits deep in oversold territory, but cheap doesn’t always mean opportunity. When momentum is absent and structure remains weak, early buyers often find themselves stuck watching price drift sideways for weeks. For ADA, the real question isn’t how low it has gone; it’s whether it has the strength to escape. Trapped In the Red Zone: Pressure, Not Opportunity Trend Rider, in a recent update shared on X, explained that ADA’s daily chart has been flashing signals that many traders interpret as a “perfect bottom.” With the price sitting at the lower end of the bands and deep in the red, the temptation to buy looks obvious. However, Rider cautioned that low prices alone are not a guarantee that a move higher is ready to begin. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator According to the analysis using the Rider Algo, Cardano is currently pinned inside a dark red zone. While some see this area as a solid floor, Trend Rider views it as a zone of heavy pressure and exhaustion, where price often drifts sideways for extended periods, leaving traders stuck in unproductive consolidation. Rider emphasized that trying to catch absolute bottoms rarely works out, often resulting in either catching a falling knife or watching capital remain stagnant while other assets show clearer momentum. As a result, Rider’s focus is not on buying at the lowest possible price, but on waiting for confirmation that strength is returning as the key is not support, but escape. Trend Rider expects Cardano to demonstrate the ability to climb out of the red zone with conviction. Specifically, the analyst is watching for a decisive breakout and a daily close above the $0.45 level. Until that happens, the bears still control the market structure. For now, Rider’s plan is to enter at a higher price with confirmed momentum than gamble on a “perfect bottom” and hope it holds. Currently, trading is about correct timing, not arriving first. Cardano Buyers Defend $0.33–$0.36 From Marcus Corvinus’s analysis, Cardano is currently reacting from a key demand zone between $0.33 and $0.36, an area where buyers have previously stepped in to defend the price. This zone is now under close watch as it could once again play a crucial role in determining the next move. Related Reading: Cardano Nears End Of 2020-Style Correction: Is $5 To $10 Next? Corvinus noted that if the demand zone holds and bullish momentum begins to build, ADA could see a more sustained bounce, potentially opening the way toward the next major resistance level around $0.53. As things stand, this area is shaping up to be a decision point for the market. Continued buyer defense could help rebuild structure and gradually shift pressure back to the upside.

    "title": "Expert Analyzes XRP, Ethereum, And Solana: Predictions For The Next Altcoin Season",
    "body": "As the crypto market faces uncertainty and continues in a consolidation phase, market expert Sam Daodu has issued a report examining the potential for XRP, Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) to emerge as frontrunners if a new altcoin season arises in 2026. XRP, ETH, And SOL Price Forecasts Daodu began his analysis by pointing out that Bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance is currently hovering around 59%, alongside an Altcoin Season Index reading of 55. These indicators suggest that 2026 could herald a substantial rotation towards altcoins, mirroring significant shifts experienced during cycles in 2016-2017 and 2020-2021. The expert outlines several bullish scenarios for each. For XRP, he envisions a potential surge past the $6-$8 range if exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows maintain a monthly average exceeding $400 million and RippleNet continues to expand its influence in global banking. Related Reading: ‘I’m Very Bullish’: Ripple CEO Forecasts Record Performance For Crypto In 2026 ETH, on the other hand, could see itself climbing toward $12,000-$18,000 if Layer 2 (L2) adoption unlocks broader usage and ETF inflows rebound. Daodu highlights that active addresses are at cycle highs, indicating organic demand that may translate to higher prices once institutional sentiment shifts positively. For SOL, the outlook is similarly optimistic. Solana might rocket to the range of $500-$800 if its transaction finality of 150 milliseconds and low fees attract a new wave of applications. Additionally, the rise in ETF filings could lead to significant capital inflows. Potential Risks Ahead In more stable scenarios, Daodu suggests that XRP might consolidate between $2.50-$3.50 if institutional adoption progresses steadily without dramatic catalysts. He also speculates that Ethereum could trade within the range of $5,000-$9,000, benefiting from consistent demand driven by staking yields and decentralized finance (DeFi) growth. Meanwhile, Solana might trend between $200-$350, assuming that developer growth and retail adoption continue at their current pace without major breakthroughs. However, Daodu cautions that XRP could fall below $1.50 if demand for ETFs wanes or if regulatory uncertainties arise. Similarly, ETH could fall below $2,500 if scalability issues arise or if regulatory challenges become more pronounced. SOL could drop below $100 if outages persist or if it faces increased competition from other Layer 1 platforms. What AI Models Anticipate AI predictions provide additional insight into the expected performance of these altcoins. For XRP, forecasts vary significantly, with ChatGPT estimating a range of $0.80-$3.00, while Grok presents a more bullish outlook with a target of $1.50-$6.00. Related Reading: Crypto Boom Ahead? Pantera Capital Pinpoints Major Catalysts For 2026 Success Ethereum’s AI predictions show a range of $3,000-$9,000 from ChatGPT, while Gemini anticipates a high of $7,000-$18,000 through increased tokenization. Lastly, Solana’s predictions range from $120-$350 from ChatGPT to a more optimistic $300-$800 from Gemini, depending on the growth of consumer applications. XRP was trading at $1.93 at the time of writing, down 2% in the previous 24 hours. ETH traded at roughly $2,952, while SOL traded at $128, both experiencing comparable declines during the same time period. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "21Shares has announced the launch of the first spot DOGE Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) backed by the Dogecoin Foundation, aiming to offer investors regulated, physically backed access to the largest memecoin by market capitalization. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $80,000? Analyst Warns Of Potential Free Fall As BTC Erases 2026 Gains Dogecoin Goes From Memecoin To Wall Street On Wednesday, financial services company 21Shares announced the launch of its 21Shares Dogecoin ETF (TDOG) on Nasdaq to provide “a new way to gain physically-backed DOGE exposure in traditional portfolios.” According to the announcement, the firm’s DOGE ETF is the only investment product of its category to be officially endorsed by the Dogecoin Foundation, the nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting the ecosystem’s development. Notably, two other spot DOGE ETFs are live: Grayscale’s GDOG and Bitwise’s BWOW. As reported by NewsBTC, the funds debuted in late November, becoming the first DOGE ETFs in the US market. TDOG’s launch builds on 21Shares’ collaboration with the House of Doge, the corporate arm of the foundation supporting the ecosystem, to create new opportunities across the Dogecoin ecosystem. The newly launched product will offer investors direct exposure to DOGE through a fully backed, transparent, and exchange-traded vehicle, holding the asset on a 1:1 basis in institutional-grade custody. Regarding its decision to launch a DOGE ETF, 21Shares affirmed that the memecoin “captures the spirit of internet culture and continues to evolve in our digital economy.” Moreover, the firm argued that it has “helped onboard many new users to crypto, and for many people, this may serve as their first step into crypto.” Federico Brokate, 21Shares’s Global Head of Business Development, stated that “Dogecoin is a unique asset with a global community and expanding real-world use cases,” adding that “TDOG offers investors regulated, physically backed exposure to DOGE through an ETF structure they already understand and trust.” DOGE Prepares For New Rally Analyst Bitcoinsensus suggested that the leading memecoin “could be on for a massive rally to the upside” based on its performance throughout this cycle. The market watcher explained that the cryptocurrency has been experiencing “mini cycles” since 2023, which have led to “bigger and bigger rallies.” According to the chart, after its late 2022 pump, Dogecoin consolidated within a tight range before a 190% breakout in early 2024. Similarly, the memecoin repeated the same pattern throughout 2024, accumulating for months before a 480% breakout at the end of that year. Now, DOGE has been consolidating within the $0.125-$0.280 price range for nearly a year, leading the analyst to believe that a breakout towards a higher target near the $0.750 level is possible. Meanwhile, Trader Tardigrade also suggested that Dogecoin may be preparing for a massive breakout as it appears to be following its performance between late 2022 and 2024. Related Reading: BitMine’s Ethereum Holdings Near 3.5% Supply Milestone As ETH Falls Below $3,000 At the time, the cryptocurrency had apparently bottomed out but ultimately recorded another local low before reversing. Based on this, the analyst affirmed that the memecoin “might see a slightly lower low” in the coming weeks, before the next massive surge occurs. As of this writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1249, a 1.75% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Targets $6–$14 After Final Shakeout: Certified Elliott Wave Analyst",
    "body": "Certified Elliott Wave analyst XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) told followers on X that “$5+ remains on the horizon,” arguing that the token’s past year of range-bound trading is validating an Elliott Wave “flat” correction that typically resolves with a sharp, final move before a continuation higher. In a 10-minute video shared alongside the post, the analyst framed XRP’s recent price action as the late stage of a flat pattern, an extended period where neither bulls nor bears can force a clean trend. “A flat occurs when the market fails to trend on both sides. They’re basically evenly matched,” he said. “And that’s not a sign of weakness, it’s a sign of balance.” XRP Traders ‘Exhausted’ As Breakout Nears XForceGlobal positioned the structure as a corrective phase within a larger bullish sequence, describing the market as forming a new floor rather than breaking down. “This is where the buyers and sellers enter a Mexican standoff with each other, creating a new price floor,” he said, adding that the sideways feel is the point: “They’re not designed to go anywhere, basically. And the markets naturally alternate between expansion and compression.” Related Reading: Santiment Says XRP Social Sentiment Hits ‘Extreme Fear’: Buy Signal? The analyst emphasized the psychological aspect of prolonged consolidation, arguing that flats tend to “eliminate even the leverage traders through time rather than price” by exhausting both sides. “By the time the flat actually resolves, which is very close, in my opinion, most traders are emotionally already exhausted,” he said. “Positioning has been pretty much neutralized, and the path for continuation, to me, becomes very clear.” In Elliott Wave terms, XForceGlobal described the flat as a three-part A-B-C structure, with waves A and B unfolding as corrective “three-wave” moves and wave C completing as an impulsive “five-wave” move. He argued that this final phase is the moment the market stops drifting and forces a resolution. “Wave C must be impulsive because it represents the resolution of the balance that we have for waves A and B,” he said. “It’s not the continuation of a larger structure to the downside.” He framed impulsiveness as behavioral rather than directional, attributing it to urgency and follow-through once one side “decisively gives up,” clearing out the range that built during the earlier legs. That distinction matters for positioning, because his base case anticipates one more decisive shakeout before a move higher. He said the market is currently in an “expanded flat” configuration where wave B pushed above the prior high, and he expects a break of local structure “once” before the market turns up. He highlighted $1.70 as a prior low that could be undercut as part of the process without invalidating the larger setup, so long as broader support holds. Related Reading: XRP Distribution Phase Continues, But Funding Rates Suggest Shorts Are Overextended XForceGlobal’s post leaned heavily on conviction built over time—“I didn’t spend 2,000+ days accumulating XRP for no reason!”—while also stressing that he has already taken some profit. In the transcript, he said he “personally took some profits around the $2.70 level” and would continue to “sell into strength.” On upside expectations, he called for higher levels “in this current cycle,” tying potential targets to the duration of the consolidation. “The longer that we distribute here, the higher the targets are going to be,” he said, adding that “a minimum of a $6 range all the way up to even the $14 range is my personal target.” He also flagged conditions that would change the trade management. If the market shows “red flags” and breaks further structure than he expects, he suggested that is where risk management should take priority. For XRP traders, the practical takeaway from his framework is timing and path, not direction: a final, forceful leg lower could still be consistent with a bullish continuation thesis while a deeper structural breakdown would challenge it. At press time, XRP traded at $1.91. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Here’s Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Prices Are Still Crashing Hard",
    "body": "Crypto researcher Axel has provided insights into why the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana prices are still crashing. This comes as BTC continues to see a supply overhang, which threatens to put more downward pressure on crypto prices. Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Prices Are Still Crashing In a research report, Axel noted that anomalous exchange inflows accompanied the BTC breakdown below the $90,000 zone as sellers prepared in advance. The market is also still at risk of further selling pressure as the 1.0 level of the short-term holders’ SOPR is now acting as a resistance rather than support. As such, there is a possibility that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana prices will decline further. Related Reading: Altcoin Season In Q1? Bitcoin, Ethereum Breakdown Maps Out Performance Further commenting on Bitcoin netflows into exchanges, Axel noted that between January 20 and 21, almost 17,000 BTC flowed into exchanges, coinciding with BTC dropping to as low as $87,000, while Ethereum and Solana prices also dropped. The crypto researcher explained that these anomalously high values followed a period of predominantly negative netflow in the first half of this month. In the context of the falling Bitcoin price, Axel stated that such a spike is more likely to reflect supply preparation than neutral transfers. In other words, the breakdown below $90,000 appears to be structural rather than emotional. Meanwhile, Bitcoin netflow returned to neutral levels yesterday, but the accumulated inflow still creates a supply overhang, which could lead to further declines in the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Axel noted that a signal of improvement would be if netflow turns negative again amid rising prices, which could indicate that the overhang has cleared. However, with the short-term holders’ 7-day SMA SOPR below 0.996, the crypto researcher suggested that BTC faces increased selling pressure on every recovery as these holders look to sell at breakeven. He added that a reversal trigger could be confirmed if the SOPR breaks above 1.0 from below, with the 7-day SMA holding unity for three to five days to filter out false spikes after the selloff. Why A Break Above $100,000 Looks Unlikely For Now In its latest research report, on-chain analytics platform Glassnode explained that a Bitcoin rally above $100,000 looks unlikely for now as the supply overhang persists. They noted how this overhang supply above $98,000 remains the dominant sell-side force capping short to mid-term rebounds. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Following The 2022 Fractal? Here Was The Previous Outcome Alluding to the Unspent Realized Price Distribution metric, Glassnode noted that the recent BTC rally has partially filled the prior air gap between $93,000 and $98,000, driven by redistribution from top buyers into newer market participants. However, the unresolved supply overhang is expected to likely cap attempts above the $98,400 short-term holders’ cost basis and the $100,000 level. A meaningful and sustained acceleration in demand momentum is said to be required for a clean breakout above $100,000 to occur. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "Ripple is laying out a transition in which XRP is no longer positioned primarily as a traded asset, but as infrastructure supporting tokenized finance and institutional settlement. At the World Economic Forum 2026, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse described how this shift is already taking shape through live tokenization activity, regulated integration with banks, and on-chain settlement at scale. XRP Tokenization Shifts From Theory To Balance-Sheet Reality Garlinghouse used tokenization as the primary context for explaining this transition. He described tokenization as a process that has already moved beyond experimentation and into operational use across financial institutions. To support that claim, he pointed to activity on the XRP Ledger, where tokenized asset volume expanded significantly over the course of a single year, rising from roughly $19 trillion to $33 trillion. Related Reading: Coinbase Exec Points Out The Big Difference Between Bitcoin And Central Banks That level of growth signals institutional commitment rather than exploratory testing. Tokenized assets at this scale imply the involvement of banks, custodians, and regulated entities moving real value. According to Garlinghouse, institutions are now focused on how to integrate tokenized assets into existing balance sheets, liquidity structures, and settlement processes. This shift changes what infrastructure is required. Tokenization at institutional scale demands networks that can process high volumes consistently, provide deterministic settlement, and operate continuously. The XRP Ledger is being positioned within this framework as a system capable of supporting that throughput. The emphasis is not on innovation for its own sake, but on reliability and execution under real financial constraints. As tokenized assets become embedded in core financial operations, the supporting rails stop being optional. They become foundational. That is the context in which XRP is being discussed, not as a standalone asset, but as part of the machinery enabling tokenized finance to function. Connecting Regulated Assets And On-Chain Liquidity Garlinghouse also addressed the structural challenge that emerges as tokenization intersects with decentralized finance. Institutions want access to programmability and liquidity, but they cannot compromise compliance, custody, or trust. He described this tension as the central problem Ripple is working to solve. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin About To Repeat NVIDIA’s Run? Here’s What The Chart Says Rather than positioning itself against traditional finance, Ripple is working directly with global banks to build regulated pathways between tokenized assets and on-chain liquidity. The objective is to allow institutions to interact with decentralized systems without stepping outside regulatory frameworks. Within this design, XRP serves as a settlement and connectivity layer, enabling movement between systems. This approach reframes XRP’s utility. Its value lies in facilitating finality, liquidity access, and interoperability across regulated and on-chain environments. As tokenized assets, decentralized rails, and institutional settlement converge, networks capable of delivering finality at scale become increasingly important. Garlinghouse emphasized that the XRP Ledger already provides this capability, giving it a structural advantage. As a result, XRP is no longer positioned primarily as a tradeable asset; it is being aligned as infrastructure that enables the issuance, movement, and settlement of value within an increasingly tokenized financial system.

    "title": "Dogecoin Is A ‘Client-Statement Risk’ For Advisers, ETF Experts Say",
    "body": "Dogecoin’s attempt to join the institutional ETF lineup is running into a basic problem: institutions may not want it. In a Jan. 22 conversation on the Crypto Prime podcast, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart and host Nate Geraci who is also the President of NovaDius Wealth Management said spot Dogecoin ETFs have attracted “near zero” demand so far, an outcome they tied to who typically buys DOGE, and how financial advisers think about reputational risk inside client portfolios. The Dogecoin datapoint landed inside a broader discussion about a crowded crypto ETF pipeline. Seyffart said his running tally of crypto ETF filings has climbed “over 150 unquestionably,” with many products spanning spot and derivatives, income overlays, buffers, and multi-asset structures. The surge, he argued, looks like issuers “throw[ing] the spaghetti at the wall” in 2026. Dogecoin ETF Reality Check But volume of filings doesn’t guarantee demand, and Dogecoin is the clearest example offered of that gap thus far. Pressed on which existing products stood out, Seyffart said “nothing really stands out,” before singling out Dogecoin as the exception, precisely because it has not resonated. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flirts With An Inverse Head And Shoulders: $0.15 Break Is The Trigger “The real honest answer is like nothing really stands out to me honestly if I have to pick one thing that kind of stands out, it’s probably that the Doge ETFs have gotten almost no interest whatsoever,” he said. He added that while some newer altcoin products have done “decently well,” Dogecoin has not. My conversation w/ @JSeyff on current state of crypto ETFs… We discuss: -Crypto ETF sentiment -150+ crypto-related ETF filings -Morgan Stanley crypto ETFs -BlackRock’s next move -Index & active crypto ETFs -Recent flows -What’s nexthttps://t.co/2TzJAnKXuK via @CryptoPrimePod pic.twitter.com/mtDuuDirB7 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) January 22, 2026 Seyffart and Geraci converged on a demand thesis: the marginal buyer of DOGE likely already has the tooling and habit set to buy it directly, rather than through an ETF wrapper. “I remember talking to the guys at Bitwise. I was like, I don’t think anyone’s going to buy this,” Seyffart said. “But maybe I’m wrong. I’ve been wrong plenty of times before. But I mean, literally no one has bought like the Doge ETFs […] I had pretty low expectations, but I thought maybe they could get to a point where they’re slightly profitable.” Seyffart pointed to Bitwise’s product—ticker BWOW—as an early scoreboard: “it’s under a million in assets right now,” he said, calling that “near zero demand.” He cautioned the funds are still new, noting the Bitwise product launched at the end of November, but framed the initial traction as “very minuscule.” Geraci’s explanation was blunter: ”The people who buy that, in general, these are degens and they already know how to access this. They already have digital wallets. They don’t need an ETF to access this […]. And I think that’s going to be a lot of these other coins that are much further down the market cap spectrum.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Foundation-Backed ETF Launches On Nasdaq As Analysts Call For Massive DOGE Rally Geraci argued Dogecoin faces an additional headwind that doesn’t show up in crypto-native narratives but matters in the ETF market: advisers. “The other aspect here […] is what I call client statement risk,” Geraci said. “So financial advisors, they’re the biggest driver of ETF flows. And so let’s take Dogecoin as an example […] If you’re a financial adviser and you have a Dogecoin ETF show up on a client statement […] it’s like a flashing red light saying, ‘Please fire me and go find another adviser.’” That framing matters because the episode repeatedly returned to distribution realities. Seyffart said he’s most excited about basket and index-style crypto ETFs, in part because advisers don’t want to “pick those winners and losers” across a growing long tail of assets. In Geraci’s view, a basket is the “easy button” for professional allocators who want crypto exposure without underwriting each token’s story or defending it to clients. Seyffart also suggested “what the actual chain is doing” can shape adviser appetite, contrasting niche infrastructure plays such as Chainlink, which he described as connecting DeFi and TradFi, against meme assets like DOGE, which he implied may be less “appetizing” for ETF buyers. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.12479. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Stablecoins May Soon Power Payments Made Entirely By AI—CEO",
    "body": "Circle’s chief executive painted a brisk picture at Davos this week: autonomous software agents that act for people could be using stablecoins to pay for everyday things within three to five years. He said these agents will need a money system that is stable, fast, and programmable. That, he argued, points to stablecoins as the likely choice. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sharp Reversal Leaves Over $800 Million Liquidated In 1 Day AI Agents And Money According to reports, Jeremy Allaire of Circle said “literally billions” of AI agents may be transacting on behalf of users in the near term. “Three years, five years from now, one can expect that there will be billions, literally billions of AI agents conducting economic activity in the world on a continuous basis,” Allaire said during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He described work on new networks and tools aimed at letting software act like small businesses or helpers that buy services, settle bills, and tip content creators. This idea is simple on the surface: software needs a reliable unit of account when it spends, and tokenized dollars can fit that role. Building The Tools Reports say companies across the crypto and tech world are racing to build the plumbing for this future. Circle is pitching USDC as a neutral payments layer that software can plug into. Other firms are testing protocols that let a machine sign off on a payment when certain conditions are met. Some large tech groups are also exploring ways for their platforms to let software pay for services automatically. Progress is visible, but the path is not yet clear. What Regulators Might Ask Regulators will have questions. Reports note concerns about money flow, consumer protections, and where bank deposits sit if stablecoins grow rapidly. At Davos, the CEO pushed back on the idea that stablecoins would drain bank deposits the way some fear, saying comparisons to other financial instruments are more fitting. Still, lawmakers in the US and elsewhere are watching closely. Rules could move faster if policy makers see real volume coming from so-called agentic commerce. New Networks, New Risks Based on reports, the technical choices will shape both convenience and danger. If agents can move value at scale, fraud and theft risks may rise too.

    "title": "Ethereum Funding Rates Pushing Towards Negative: What’s Going On?",
    "body": "Ethereum is currently trading under pressure after failing to push above the $3,000 level again over the past 24 hours, a move that is reflecting trader sentiment across the derivatives markets. ETH is currently trading at $2,925, down 2.7% on the day, after moving within a 24-hour range capped at $3,012.99 and finding lows around $2,909.60, according to price data from CoinGecko. As price action weakens, a notable change has been developing, with on-chain data showing funding rates drifting toward negative territory and derivative positioning beginning to tilt more defensively. Funding Rates Slide As Shorts Gain Ground Ethereum’s failure to hold above $3,000 is an important psychological break for traders, especially after several failed attempts to hold above that level in January. Price action over the past week shows sellers maintaining control after ETH rejected around $3,360 on January 18, followed by a steady push lower toward the high-$2,900s. Related Reading: The Ethereum MACD Crossover That Could Lead To A Massive Bull Wave Although the pullback has so far been orderly above $2,900, this decline has come alongside fading momentum across the derivatives market. One of the clearest signals for this can be seen in Ethereum’s OI-weighted funding rate, which has been steadily compressing and is now edging toward negative levels. At the time of writing, Ethereum’s OI-weighted is at 0.0008%, close to breaking into negative territory and far below readings around 0.009%, which it registered earlier in the month. Funding rates turning negative typically indicate that short positions are paying longs, meaning stronger demand for downside exposure. Funding spikes that previously accompanied the price rebound in early January have faded, and the overall trend suggests bearish positioning is slowly gaining the upper hand. Open Interest, Liquidations, And What’s Next Although Ethereum’s price action fell below $3,000, derivatives traders have stayed in the market, keeping total open interest at high levels. Data from CoinGlass shows aggregate Ethereum open interest increasing by 0.68% in the past 24 hours, which shows that many traders are not exiting Ethereum entirely. At the time of writing, the total open interest is sitting at about 13.36 million ETH, equivalent to roughly $39.19 billion. Related Reading: Ethereum’s 4-Hour Chart Says A Big Dump Is Coming, Here’s The Target Looking across major exchanges, Binance has the largest share of ETH open interest, accounting for about $8.95 billion, but it is down by 0.8% in the past 24 hours. CME follows with approximately $5.73 billion in open interest, up by 3.72% in the past 24 hours. Gate comes next at around $4.01 billion, while MEXC comes in close at $3.51 billion worth of ETH open interest. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum liquidations totaled $64.34 million, with long positions ($52.52 million) accounting for the majority of losses. A hold above $2,900 could allow Ethereum’s funding rates to normalize and open the door for another rebound attempt to $3,000. However, a continued fall in funding rates into negative territory could see bearish control pushing Ethereum below $2,900. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Ethereum Emerges As Likely Candidate In BlackRock Tokenization Vision – Here’s Why",
    "body": "Recent remarks from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink have pointed toward the need for a single, unified blockchain for tokenized markets, and have intensified the focus on platforms capable of handling institutional-scale liquidity, compliance, and settlement. With its long track record in smart contracts, extensive developer ecosystem, and growing role in regulated financial products, Ethereum is now emerging as the most likely candidate to serve as the settlement layer for tokenized capital markets. Why Asset Managers Prefer Familiar Infrastructure In an X post, the Ethereum Daily shared a video in which BlackRock CEO Larry Fink made it clear that tokenization is necessary. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, Fink said the financial system must move rapidly toward digitization, adding that a single, common blockchain could reduce corruption and improve transparency across the global markets. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Institutional Support, Though ETH Price Outlook Remains Contested While Fink did not name a specific network, the most plausible candidate could be ETH, based on BlackRock’s own initiatives and public statements that emphasized the role of ETH in asset tokenization. The firm has consistently highlighted ETH as a core platform for its on-chain strategy. Meanwhile, BlackRock launched its BUIDL tokenized money market fund directly on ETH, a product that has already grown to over $2 billion in total value locked. “There’s no second best,” Ethereum Daily noted. In the staking space, Bitmine has turned Ethereum staking into a multi-billion-dollar business. An analyst known as Milk Road has revealed that the company now has 1.83 million ETH staked, worth roughly $6 million at current prices, and plans to scale that figure toward 4.2 million ETH over time. Over the past months, Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. (BMNR) has accounted for nearly 50% of all new ETH entering the staking queue. Staking at this scale is important because it removes ETH from the liquid supply and locks it into long-term infrastructure rather than keeping it for short-term trading. When one player is willing to commit billions of dollars worth of ETH to staking, it reflects confidence in ETH’s future economic prospects. A lower liquid supply, combined with sustained network demand, will create structural pressure over time. How Support Built Through Multiple Market Cycles Analyst Milk Road has also highlighted that Ethereum is holding near a critical support zone around $3,000, hovering just above the lower boundary of its long-term rising structure, an area that has acted as a stress test for ETH throughout the cycle. Historically, when ETH drifts into this area, the market will need to decide whether the weakness is temporary or structural. Related Reading: Ethereum Maintains Structural Strength Despite Resistance Near $3,400 The $2,750 level remains the key line because it has repeatedly stopped downside pressure after macro-driven or narrative-driven pullbacks, making it a reliable floor for the broader trend. As long as ETH holds above that level, the broader multi-year uptrend will remain intact. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "XRP Price Recovery Is Possible If It Reclaims This Ichimoku Base",
    "body": "The XRP price may be preparing for a long-overdue recovery, as a crypto analyst has just highlighted a critical area that could flip the cryptocurrency’s downward momentum into a bullish one. According to the market expert, XRP must reclaim the Ichimoku Base before it can resume its upside to new levels. XRP Price Recovery To Resume Above Ichimoku Base Market analyst Xaif Crypto took to X this Thursday to deliver a fresh weekly update on XRP as the cryptocurrency enters a pivotal technical area after months of downside pressure. The accompanying chart shows price retreating from a prior peak in late 2024 and sliding back into a clearly marked demand zone in the blue box. Related Reading: What the Triple-Tap At $1.80 Means For The XRP Price According to the analyst, the recent retreat follows a clear downtrend, with lower highs pushing price back toward a previous consolidation zone. This blue-box area represents the main battleground, as prior trading activity built a base that could act as support if XRP revisits that level. So far, XRP appears to be stabilizing within this demand zone. Candles on the chart show hesitation and reduced selling pressure. The chart also draws attention to an Ichimoku structure, with XRP attempting to reclaim its Ichimoku Base. According to Xaif Crypto, this base will determine XRP’s next big move. The analyst has suggested that reclaiming this level could signal a potential shift in market sentiment. He disclosed that a strong close above it could favor upside continuation, weakening the ongoing downtrend and giving buyers more room to target upper resistance levels. Conversely, Xaif Crypto predicts that a break below the Ichimoku Base would likely lead to a deeper correction for XRP, as support would be lost and selling could accelerate. For now, XRP sits at a make-or-break level that could decide whether it recovers from its current slump. Xaif Crypto’s chart has outlined potential targets if the cryptocurrency manages to reclaim and hold above the Ichimoku Base. Currently hovering around $1.95, XRP faces potential bullish targets at $2.09, $2.20, $2.31, and $2.45. The analyst has also highlighted that traders and investors should closely watch the weekly close for confirmation of a sustained recovery. Analyst Says XRP Is Planning A Major Reversal Despite dropping below $2 earlier this week, analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s price outlook. According to market expert Crypto GVR, XRP could be attempting a major price reversal from the $1-$1.5 range. Based on his chart analysis, the analyst predicts that XRP could decline first from its current price around $1.95 to roughly $1.13 before rebounding sharply to new highs. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Surge Another 30% If This Trend Is Confirmed He has set a bullish target at $3.25. marking the next upside for XRP. If XRP were to crash to $1.13 and then surge to $3.25, this would represent a staggering 187% increase in value. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Litecoin Structure Intact, But $63 Remains The Line Bulls Must Defend",
    "body": "Litecoin is once again at a critical crossroads, with its long-term structure remaining intact after years of successful defenses. However, the margin for error is thin. As price hovers near key levels, $63 has emerged as the line bulls must protect. A break below it could shift momentum sharply, while holding above keeps the broader bullish structure alive and sets the stage for the next decisive move. Structure Gives Way, Expansion Phase Begins Columbus’s latest LTC update highlights that the multi-year compression that previously capped price action has finally resolved, resulting in a clean break of the long-term chart setup. This structural change confirms a shift from a neutral state to a clearly bullish one. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Litecoin Price May Be Getting Ready For Another Massive Rally The current price action is described as a pause before expansion rather than the conclusion of the rally. In this phase, Litecoin is holding steady above old resistance levels, allowing the market to load for the next leg of the move, turning previous barriers into new support. Litecoin’s projected path forward is based on the typical behavior of expansion cycles following structural breaks. The strategy follows a clear three-step progression: the initial breakout, followed by the current phase of acceptance. Once the market fully accepts these new price levels, the “real move” begins, representing a phase where the most significant gains are expected to materialize. The 9-Year Trendline That Still Controls Litecoin Matthew Dixon highlighted the immense historical significance of the Litecoin long-term trend line. This line has acted as an unbreakable floor for nine years, with the price never closing below it. While the market has dipped under this line multiple times in the past, every attempt to break down has ultimately failed, maintaining a remarkably consistent structural defense. Related Reading: Litecoin Follows Bitcoin’s Momentum, But Resistance Looms At $79.60 Currently, the market environment is putting this nearly decade-long support to the test once again. Dixon emphasizes that we cannot rely on intra-month volatility to determine the outcome. Instead, the definitive signal rests solely on the monthly candle close. This closing price will serve as a macro-economic pivot point that dictates the primary direction for the coming months. A successful hold above the trend line would be a powerful bullish confirmation, suggesting the long-term uptrend remains intact despite external pressures. Conversely, a confirmed close below this line would shift the narrative to bearish, marking a historic breakdown of a nine-year support system. Specific technical triggers are also in play, particularly the $63 level. Dixon warns that falling below $63 would be devastating, as it would effectively nullify the hidden bullish divergence currently supporting the price. Given these risks, Dixon recommends exercising patience until the monthly close or ensuring strict stop losses are in place for any active trades.

    "title": "Bitcoin Stuck In Bear Mode For 83 Days: Trend Pulse Confirms Structural Weakness",
    "body": "Bitcoin continues to struggle as it attempts to reclaim the $90,000 level, with traders facing a market defined by hesitation rather than conviction. After yesterday’s bearish breakdown below $90K, price action has slipped back into indecisive territory, raising fresh questions about whether this pullback is a temporary shakeout or the start of a deeper corrective phase. Related Reading: XRP Distribution Phase Continues, But Funding Rates Suggest Shorts Are Overextended According to top analyst Axel Adler, a macro indicator called Trend Pulse helps explain why momentum has faded. Adler notes that since January 19, the market has remained in Bear Mode, with the Bull phase absent for 83 consecutive days. Two separate charts reinforce this shift, showing that both short-term momentum and quarterly performance have turned negative at the same time. Trend Pulse recently shifted from Neutral to Bear, driven by a double-negative setup: the 14-day return has flipped red, and the SMA30 versus SMA200 trend signal is also negative. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s quarterly return sits at -19%, confirming macro weakness, but without the kind of extreme that often signals a definitive bottom. Bitcoin Remains Stuck In Bear Mode As Macro Signals Stay Negative Adler notes that Bitcoin’s last Bull Mode signal was printed on November 2, 2025, when BTC traded near $110,000—roughly 83 days ago. Since then, the market has failed to regain structural strength. Even the Neutral stretch between December 30 and January 18 proved too short and too weak to restore the long-term trend, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable once selling pressure returned. Adler explains that the first trigger for improvement is the 14-day return moving back above 0, which would shift the regime from Bear to Neutral. However, a full transition back into Bull Mode requires a second condition: SMA30 breaking above SMA200. Given the current divergence between the two averages, that crossover would likely demand 3–4 weeks of sustained upside rather than a short-lived bounce. The Bitcoin Price Performance chart adds macro context by tracking quarterly return (90D) as a sentiment proxy. Historically, readings above +75% align with euphoria, while values below 0% signal pessimism, and drops below -30% reflect capitulation. Bitcoin’s quarterly return sits near -19%, negative but far from deep bear-market extremes. Yet the 7-day change (-6.8%) suggests downside momentum is accelerating after the $90K breakdown. Together, Trend Pulse and quarterly returns point to moderate pessimism without final capitulation, leaving the market at a decision point. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Stalls At 71%: Still Not Enough For A Sustainable Recovery BTC Moving Averages Cap Recovery Bitcoin is trading near $89,000 after failing to hold above the $90,000 psychological level, reinforcing the market’s current indecision. The chart shows BTC printing a lower-high structure since the early November peak, followed by a sharp selloff that reset price into a wide consolidation range. After bottoming in late November, Bitcoin rebounded but struggled to build sustained momentum, repeatedly stalling on push attempts toward the mid-$90K zone. From a trend perspective, BTC remains pressured beneath its key moving averages. Price is trading below the green long-term average and the blue mid-term average, both of which are now sloping downward, signaling that broader momentum continues to lean bearish. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Power Shift: New Whales Now Control The Market The most recent rejection occurred as BTC briefly pushed into the $95K–$97K area, only to roll over and break back down toward the range lows. Meanwhile, the red long-term average remains well above price near the low-$100Ks, highlighting how far BTC would need to recover to reestablish a stronger macro uptrend. Volume has picked up on selloffs relative to bounces, suggesting that downside moves are still being met with more urgency. For bulls, reclaiming $90K and then holding above $92K–$94K is key. Otherwise, the chart keeps risk open for a deeper pullback toward the mid-$80K region. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Showing Strength, Analyst Points To $4 Potential",
    "body": "XRP has begun attracting attention again after months of sideways trading. The coin has risen slightly over the past day, though it remains down for the week. Traders are pointing to familiar chart patterns, suggesting the quiet period may be nearing an end. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sharp Reversal Leaves Over $800 Million Liquidated In 1 Day Traders Spot A Familiar Price Pattern A fresh take on XRP came from DonWedge, who posted a half-day chart on TradingView. Though he kept it short – just “XRP looks good” – the message carried weight. Instead of bold predictions, his analysis leaned on patterns. A downward-sloping channel draws the eye, much like one seen months before. Shape echoes past rhythm. What stands out is how closely current movement tracks earlier behavior. The image tells part of the story; context fills in the rest. Time will show whether history bends toward repetition. That old rise in XRP moved fast. Following that climb, it slipped into a steady decline lasting around half a year. Once sellers slowed their pace, the price jumped again without warning. $XRP looks good pic.twitter.com/OnyChRVzNp — Don 🐂 (@DonWedge) January 21, 2026 Fresh lows in XRP’s path hug the bottom stretch of a familiar range, pressure easing – some watchful eyes guess what comes next might climb. Volume And Resistance Are Key According to reports, the next major hurdle is a multi-month trendline resistance near $2.10. A clean daily close above this line, combined with rising volume, could signal the start of a new uptrend. DonWedge projects that if the breakout occurs, XRP could aim for $4. From current levels, this would require a little over a 100% increase. Traders note, however, that moves without volume confirmation can fail, leading to false breakouts and extended consolidation. Market Expert Projects A Telling Year Based on reports, analyst ChartNerd says 2026 will be a “telling year” for XRP. He expects the coin either to confirm a strong breakout with fresh momentum or to fall below the structure it has defended for over a year. After a macro breakout in Q4 2024, $XRP has been accumulating above its prior 2021 highs for over a year. The whole of 2025 was sideways, boring, and a test of even the most durable minds. 2026 is going to be the telling year. Compression typically leads to expansion. Buckle up. pic.twitter.com/QJb7JAmIkL — 🇬🇧 ChartNerd 📊 (@ChartNerdTA) January 18, 2026 Lately, the sideways grind has worn thin for some investors – yet hints of resilience still flicker through the numbers. Breaking past $2.10 with force might spark what comes next, lining up with the pattern DonWedge laid out on his chart. Patience now may quietly pay off later. Related Reading: Bitcoin Influencers Get Spotlight In X’s New ‘Starterpacks’ A Breakout Might Shift What Happens Next A sudden jump in price might push XRP toward $4 fast, provided it finishes above the trendline with strong movement. Higher goals are possible, yet reaching them means buyers keep stepping in without pause. So far, things look cautious rather than certain. Traders will probably keep an eye on activity levels, holding back bigger moves until signs become clearer. What happens next might show if XRP surges again or just drifts sideways some more.

    "title": "Bitcoin Indicator Falls Back To Post-Bear Market Levels: Investors Approach A Key Decision Point",
    "body": "Bitcoin is trading below the $90,000 level once again, as the market continues to drift through a phase defined by indecision, rising caution, and growing fear. After repeated failures to reclaim this psychological threshold, price action has started to reflect a lack of conviction on both sides, with buyers hesitating to step in aggressively and sellers pressing every rebound attempt. While the broader trend has not fully collapsed, the inability to hold key levels is increasing uncertainty around Bitcoin’s next major move. Related Reading: XRP Distribution Phase Continues, But Funding Rates Suggest Shorts Are Overextended Top analyst Darkfost argues that on-chain signals are starting to mirror conditions typically seen near the end of prolonged drawdowns. According to his analysis, Bitcoin’s unrealized profits and losses are sliding back toward levels that have historically appeared only at the exit of bear markets, when the market has already absorbed a deep reset in sentiment. This shift suggests that stress is building under the surface, even if price has not yet entered a full capitulation phase. Since Bitcoin’s last all-time high, Darkfost notes that many late-arriving investors have moved into uncomfortable territory, facing mounting downside pressure as the market cools. As a result, unrealized profits are shrinking, unrealized losses are expanding, and the overall balance continues to deteriorate—an environment that often forces traders into a decisive choice between holding through volatility or exiting under stress. Decision Point For Bitcoin Investors Darkfost highlighted a chart based on an adjusted version of NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss), designed to capture investor stress more accurately during shifting market regimes. Instead of relying solely on the standard market cap, the model incorporates the realized capitalization of both Short-Term Holders (STHs) and Long-Term Holders (LTHs), then compares that blended realized foundation against Bitcoin’s traditional market cap. The result is a clearer view of how much profit or loss sits “on paper” across the market, filtered through a more structural lens. To reduce noise and better define trend shifts, the metric is smoothed using an average, producing what Darkfost refers to as aNUPL. The key takeaway is that Bitcoin is approaching levels that have historically forced investors into a binary decision. When unrealized profits compress and unrealized losses expand to these ranges, holders typically face two outcomes: hold and continue accumulating, or capitulate and lock in losses. That difference in behavior becomes critical because it shapes liquidity, sentiment, and the next directional trend. If long-term participants absorb the pressure and keep holding, the market can stabilize and rotate back into recovery. But if selling accelerates from stressed cohorts, the decline can deepen into a broader bear phase. This is why tracking realized and unrealized profit dynamics remains essential, especially during periods of uncertainty. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Stalls At 71%: Still Not Enough For A Sustainable Recovery Bitcoin Consolidates After Sharp Weekly Breakdown Bitcoin is trading around $89,000 on the weekly chart after a steep selloff that pushed the price out of its prior distribution zone. The latest candle reflects heavy downside pressure, with BTC dropping roughly 4.8% on the week and struggling to stabilize near a key pivot that has repeatedly acted as support and resistance throughout the cycle. After failing to hold above the psychological $90,000 threshold, the market is now trapped in a tight consolidation range, suggesting traders are waiting for confirmation before committing to a larger move. Related Reading: Ethereum Supply Tightens On Binance As Reserves Hit Lowest Level Since 2016 From a trend standpoint, Bitcoin remains vulnerable as it trades below the blue moving average, which is now acting as overhead resistance near the low-$100K region. The rejection from that dynamic level aligns with the broader structure: BTC topped near the mid-$120K range, then entered a sharp corrective leg that reset momentum into early 2026. While the green moving average continues to slope upward and is approaching the current price zone, the market has not yet shown the strength needed to reclaim its former trend trajectory. Importantly, the weekly structure is now compressing. If buyers can defend the $88K–$90K region and push BTC back above $92K–$95K, it would signal a recovery attempt toward the moving average band. However, a sustained failure here increases the risk of a deeper retracement toward the low-$80K zone, where prior demand previously emerged. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Expert Forecasts $5 XRP Price As Exchange Balances Plummet By 57%",
    "body": "XRP has given back all of its early‑year gains, sliding toward the $1.90. Despite the pullback, several on‑chain and market indicators are pointing to a possible breakout from current levels, driven largely by a sharp decline in XRP held on exchanges. XRP Exchange Balances Slide To 1.5B Market analyst Sam Daodu notes that over the past months, a substantial portion of XRP has steadily moved off centralized trading platforms and into long‑term storage and institutional custody. On‑chain figures indicate that XRP exchange balances dropped from roughly 4 billion tokens in early 2025 to about 1.5 billion by late December. This 57% decline represents the steepest annual reduction in XRP exchange supply on record. Related Reading: Binance Forms New Company In Greece, Moves Forward With MiCA Licensing Data from CryptoQuant reinforces this trend, showing shrinking XRP reserves on major trading platforms such as Binance, where balances continued to fall into early 2026. At the same time, wallet accumulation has increased, particularly among institutional custody accounts. Daodu argues that with fewer tokens available on exchanges, buying pressure that previously moved XRP only marginally can now drive gains of 10% to 15% within days. When combined with approximately $1.37 billion in XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows recorded since November 2025, Daodu believes the conditions favor a potential breakout toward the $4 to $5 range, rather than another rally that stalls below $3. Bullish, Base, And Bearish Scenarios Looking ahead, Daodu outlines three broad price paths for XRP, each tied to how exchange balances and ETF inflows evolve. In a bullish scenario, the altcoin could move into the $4 to $5 range if monthly ETF inflows average $300-$500 million and exchange balances fall below 1.5 billion tokens. A more neutral outcome would see XRP trading between $2.50 and $3.50. This scenario assumes ETF inflows slow to roughly $50 million to $70 million per week and exchange balances continue to decline at a steadier pace. Related Reading: Expert Analyzes XRP, Ethereum, And Solana: Predictions For The Next Altcoin Season The bearish case hinges on the possibility that the supply contraction thesis proves overstated. If rapid transfers refill exchange order books, escrow releases increase selling pressure, or ETF demand slows due to tighter macroeconomic conditions, XRP could lose support. In that scenario, prices may fall below $2.00 and revisit the $1.60 level during periods of risk aversion. Prolonged uncertainty could see XRP trading between $1.50 and $2.00 for much of 2026, according to the analyst. At the time of writing, the altcoin was trading at $1.94. This represented losses of 4% and 8% over seven and fourteen-day periods, respectively. This positions the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap 46% below the current all-time high of $3.64 reached back in July of last year.
