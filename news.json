    "title": "Analyst Predicts The Ethereum Price Bottom With A Marked Path To $15,000",
    "body": "Despite the Ethereum price looking to be leveling out below $2,000, the slowdown in the crash has done nothing to allay fears that more decline is coming. In fact, analysts believe that this stop is only temporary and that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap will make another major drop soon. This is due to past performance, where the Ethereum price has often staged a major reset before eventually making a possible bottom. The Scenario That Says Ethereum Price Is Headed For $600 Calls for Ethereum reaching $10,000-$15,000 were echoed loudly in the last year, when the market was still in the throes of the bull market. However, those hopes have since been dashed, with even $5,000 now looking like a pipe dream. Nevertheless, analysts like Alexhiz on the TradingView website believe that the dream is not completely gone, although the path toward this target may be quite rocky. Related Reading: Don’t Fall For The Bitcoin Trap: Analyst Explains Why Recovery To $76,000 Is Not A Good Thing In a recent post, the crypto analyst explains that it is likely that Ethereum will make a major macro correction. If this is correct, then it means that the support that the altcoin seems to have established above $1,900 is fragile at most and could end up breaking soon. The bearish scenario that Alex points to is another 60% price drop, which would eventually push the Ethereum price down toward $600. While such a price point may be disastrous in the short-term, the analyst believes that it is needed for the 5-figure scenario to play out. Why A Crash Is Good If the Ethereum price were to crash as low as $600, the crypto analyst believes this would mean a complete liquidity reset and a full market capitulation. Such a scenario would allow for strong long-term accumulation, with stronger hands taking control of the price. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted Solana Sell-Off At $250, And Is Back With A New Prediction What would follow the accumulation phase would be an expansion phase, where the price could rise rapidly. The analyst also added: “Looking further ahead (2028–2029), in a renewed bullish cycle, ETH could target the $10,000–15,000 range based on historical cycle behavior and liquidity growth.” Given this, such a scenario would take years to play out, as there could be a long, drawn-out accumulation trend, as seen in the previous cycle. Growth could also be highly dependent on the Bitcoin price performance, being the market leader for over a decade. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin COT Data: Smart Money Goes Net Long With ‘Urgency’",
    "body": "Bitcoin futures positioning among non-commercial traders is swinging sharply toward net long exposure, a move technical analyst Tom McClellan (editor of The McClellan Market Report) says has arrived “with some urgency” in the latest weekly Commitment of Traders (COT) report and one that has coincided with notable market outcomes in prior, similarly extreme episodes. Sharing a chart of Bitcoin futures (price on a log scale) alongside non-commercial net positioning, McClellan argued that in Bitcoin’s case, large speculators effectively function as the “smart money” cohort, because the market lacks the typical commercial hedger presence seen in traditional commodity futures. “The non-commercial traders of Bitcoin futures are usually the smart money,” McClellan wrote. “This week’s COT Report shows that they are moving net long with some urgency. Look back at what the last two similar excursions led to. But remember, this is ‘a condition, not a signal’.” Why Non-Commercials Matter In Bitcoin Futures McClellan later expanded on how he frames the CFTC’s weekly report, which breaks futures positioning into commercials, non-commercials, and non-reportables. In corn, for example, commercials might be producers or end users; in Bitcoin, he says that category is thin. “In Bitcoin, there are hardly any traders who qualify as Commercial traders,” McClellan wrote. “So in an unusual circumstance, the Non-commercial traders fill the role of being the smart money.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Fear Streak Extends To 22 Days As Price Struggles That distinction matters because COT is not about absolute long or short interest, every futures contract has a long and a short by definition, but about who is on each side. “Every futures contract is simultaneously one long and one short position, held by different parties. So the number of longs will always equal the number of shorts,” he wrote. “What matters is who holds the positions.” McClellan also cautioned against importing equity-market intuition about short interest into futures positioning. “So a large short position in a stock represents potential energy which could get converted into price movements via short covering,” he wrote. “COT data don’t do that. They just represent expert opinion.” The core dispute in the X thread wasn’t whether COT can be useful, but how to interpret timing. Trader toni (@tonitrades_) agreed the dataset has value but questioned whether futures positioning simply follows spot momentum. “COT data has historically been a solid indicator, no argument there,” toni wrote. “But non-commercial positioning often lags spot market moves by weeks. By the time futures traders pile in, the initial momentum is usually priced in already.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom Call On Ice: Fear Is Extreme, Whales Aren’t Buying McClellan pushed back on that sequencing. “I think you meant that their positioning PRECEDES price moves sometimes by weeks,” he replied, underscoring his view that positioning extremes can show up ahead of meaningful market moves, though not on a predictable schedule. That’s where the thread landed: with an emphasis on uncertainty. Jim Osman (@EdgeCGroup) summed it up succinctly: “Timing still uncertain.” McClellan agreed. “Exactly, hence my admonition.” In his longer explanation, McClellan reiterated that most weeks the COT report has no actionable message, but that extremes can be informative with a crucial caveat. “A lot of the time there is no useful message in the COT data for each futures contract,” he wrote. “But when an extreme develops like now in Bitcoin, then we can get useful information. But as with any overbought or oversold reading on any indicator, COT data only reflect a ‘condition’ not a signal. The data will not tell you when that condition is going to matter, only that it should matter, sometime.” At press time, BTC traded at $65,663.

This came as he noted that the meme coin has dropped to a historical macro support that has triggered explosive rallies in the past. Dogecoin Eyes 443% Rally As The Meme Coin Reaches Macro Support In an X post, Kamran shared an accompanying chart that showed that Dogecoin could rally 443% from its current level and climb above $0.45. He noted that DOGE is back at the $0.10 macro support, which is a level that has triggered exposive rallies before, making it a high-risk, high-reward zone to watch. Crypto analyst Crypto Patel also recently highlighted this macro support level as a good buy-the-dip opportunity. He urged investors to slowly accumulate if Dogecoin drops to between $0.06 and $0.08, as they prepare for a potential rally to between $1 and $2, which would mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for the foremost meme coin.

CoinGlass data shows that most crypto traders are currently more bearish than bullish on Dogecoin, with the long/short ratio at 0.8. Meanwhile, there has been a notable surge in activity in DOGE’s derivatives market. Trading volume has spiked by more than 40%, reaching $1.56 billion, while options trading volume and open interest have surged by 22% and 42%, respectively. DOGE’s Momentum Is Weak At The Moment In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that Dogecoin is holding a key trendline, but that momentum is weak. He noted that DOGE has tested the trendline for 6 consecutive daily candles and is still trying to break below it. For now, the meme coin is still holding above the descending trendline, and the structure remains bullish. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Can Still Reach $1, But It May Not Be Soon, Analyst Explains Why Trader Tardigrade further remarked that Dogecoin’s price action looks to be running on fumes and that the price needs genuine buyers for the breakout to be legitimate. He urged market participants to watch for a volume spike and conviction candles. However, until then, the analyst stated that it is “hopeful thinking” as momentum remains weak. His accompanying chart showed that the foremost meme coin could rally to as high as $0.14 if it holds above this trendline. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.09275, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "XRP Faces Short-Term Risk As Whale Inflows Hit Binance, On-Chain Data Shows",
    "body": "XRP’s short-term setup is facing renewed pressure after a sharp burst of exchange inflows to Binance, with on-chain data showing that the move was driven primarily by large holders. The spike matters because it points to a sudden increase in potential sell-side supply at a time when broader market momentum remains weak. CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost flagged the move in a post on X today, tying the development to a softer backdrop for altcoins while Bitcoin remains rangebound. “BTC continues to range, offering limited directional clarity in the short term. This lack of momentum is weighing on the broader market, with altcoins continuing to underperform in the absence of a clear trend,” Darkfost wrote. Are XRP Whales Selling? That context is important for XRP. In a market with limited follow-through, large exchange deposits can carry more weight than they would during a strong risk-on phase, especially when the flows are concentrated in whale-sized cohorts. The chart shared by Darkfost, titled “XRP Ledger: Exchange Inflow – Value Bands – Binance,” shows a clear outlier on Feb. 21. Total inflows jump to more than 31 million XRP, far above the surrounding days in the Feb. 15–23 window, with the stacked bars dominated by the 100k–1M XRP and >1M XRP cohorts. Related Reading: Mapping Out XRP’s Path To $1,200: Analyst Shares Insights Darkfost summarized the move directly: “This week was notably marked by a significant XRP inflow to Binance, which remains the go-to exchange for large transactions thanks to its deep liquidity. More than 31 million XRP were transferred to the exchange in a single day yesterday.” The chart also suggests this was not a broad-based retail event. Smaller cohorts contributed relatively little to the spike, while large holders accounted for nearly all of the move. That pattern aligns with Darkfost’s central argument that the event raises short-term risk because it represents concentrated, potentially market-moving supply arriving at a highly liquid venue. According to the breakdown shared in the post, the inflows were led by the two largest cohorts: 14,236,825 XRP from wallets in the 100k–1M band and 14,494,865 XRP from whale wallets holding more than 1M XRP. Mid-sized wallets in the 10k–100k range added 2,938,809 XRP, while the sub-10k segments contributed only a small fraction of the total. Related Reading: XRP Ledger Gets x402 Facilitator For AI Agent Payments: Why This Is Bullish Taken together, the distribution reinforces that the event was whale-led rather than diffuse. In practical terms, that matters because large-holder exchange inflows are often watched as a proxy for potential intent to sell, even if inflow alone does not confirm execution. Darkfost framed the risk in dollar terms, writing: “Altogether, this represents a sudden potential sell-side pressure of nearly $45 million that warrants close monitoring. Should this selling pressure persist, XRP may struggle to recover from its ongoing correction in the near term.” The price line overlaid on the chart shows XRP trading lower across much of the same period, sliding from the upper end of the displayed range around Feb. 15–16 before bottoming near Feb. 19 and only modestly rebounding afterward. By the time the large Feb. 21 inflow hit Binance, price had recovered somewhat but remained below earlier levels in the week. However, the rebound was completely erased during the early European morning session, as XRP fell to as low as $1.33. At press time, XRP traded at $1.3947.

    "body": "Michael Saylor’s quiet hint this weekend put a spotlight on a methodical habit that has quietly shaped corporate crypto moves for years. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Rare On-Chain Signal That Once Preceded 114% Gains Michael Saylor posted a chart with the caption “The Orange Century,” and through that single image he signaled what many traders already suspected: the company he chairs is poised to make another buy. Strategy has been buying Bitcoin in steady doses since 2020. Reports note the firm has completed 99 buys so far. That makes the next purchase the 100th. Short headline. Big milestone. The buy count matters because it shows a pattern more than it shows timing. Buy Pace And Signals The image Saylor shared on the X platform is the same type of chart the company has shown before when a purchase was near. Other market watchers read the post as a likely prelude to actual buy orders. The company has not issued a formal press release about a specific date. The Orange Century. pic.twitter.com/8zelTduTPC — Michael Saylor (@saylor) February 22, 2026 Recent Activity And Holdings According to public records, the firm now holds about 717,131 BTC at an average cost near $76,027 per coin. Market prices have drifted lower from that average. Bitcoin was trading around $65,050 at the time of the reports. That gap has put the firm’s cost basis in the red on paper. Still, buying has continued; the company has added BTC for many consecutive weeks in 2026 and showed no obvious pause even as prices moved down. Shareholders And Market Reaction Reports note that since the initial stake was bought in August 2020, the firm’s stock has climbed sharply. Yahoo Finance data shows a rise from roughly $12.44 then to about $131.05 at the time this report was made, an increase of around 950%. That price swing has made the strategy attractive to some investors who wanted exposure to Bitcoin through a public stock. Others worry about concentration risk when a single asset so heavily shapes a company’s balance sheet. How This Fits Broader Trends Other firms have copied pieces of this playbook. Moving treasury cash into Bitcoin has become one option among several for companies that want to shield some value from inflation or to chase upside tied to crypto. Related Reading: Political Meme Coins Implode: TRUMP Down 92%, MELANIA Nearly Wiped Out That has had a ripple effect: when big public holders buy, it can shift short-term flows and signal confidence to certain corners of the market. At the same time, critics argue that using corporate coffers to buy a volatile asset brings fresh governance questions. The next move will be watched closely. If the 100th buy happens, it will be seen as a reaffirmation of a strategy that has been consistent for years. Observers will then parse whether the purchase is symbolic, tactical, or simply another step in a long, steady accumulation. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Why The XRP Price Bottom Could Be In, And A Jump Above $2 Is Coming",
    "body": "The XRP price may be approaching a decisive turning point after fresh on-chain data revealed one of the most extreme capitulation events in years. According to Santiment analysis, XRP has just recorded its largest realized loss spike since 2022, a development that has previously preceded a major price recovery. The data is now fueling expectations that a bottom could be in, with a move back above $2 increasingly within reach if history repeats. XRP Price Bottom Signals Emerge After Historic Loss Spike Santiment’s weekly Network Realized Profit/Loss chart, which tracks five years of XRP alongside price action, has revealed a dramatic spike in on-chain realized losses. The latest readings came in at roughly -908 million XRP, marking the largest capitulation event since November 2022, when weekly realized losses hit nearly -1.93 billion. Related Reading: Cup And Handle Pattern Puts XRP Price At $60 After Hitting Resistance Notably, the 2022 capitulation event occurred after a period of compression and decline. At the time, XRP’s price had been trending downward for months before the -1.93 billion reading printed. This showed that investors were selling at heavy losses near what later proved to be a price bottom. After that point, the trend reversed, and over the next eight months, the XRP price rose more than 114%. Based on Santiment’s analysis, XRP’s current structure is mirroring this 2022 setup. The cryptocurrency recently fell from above $3 to the mid-$1 range, with the chart showing price hovering around $1.45 to $1.65 as the realized loss spike emerged. This sharp increase in losses suggests widespread capitulation, as many holders appear to have sold at a loss out of fear and panic rather than waiting for a potential rebound. Historically, this type of extreme loss spike tends to appear near price floors, suggesting that the recent -908 million reading in the current cycle could be a major bottom signal for XRP. The chart shows that the most negative readings cluster around key inflection points, where selling pressure peaks and then begins to fade. In both 2022 and the current setup, the realized loss spike came after a prolonged downtrend, reinforcing the idea that an XRP price bottom could be in. A Possible Recovery Toward $2 While the comparison to the 2022 capitulation event suggests a potential bottom for XRP, it also points to a potential bullish recovery. After the -1.93 billion realized loss spike in 2022, XRP did not rebound immediately. Instead, it gradually shifted structure and produced a 114% rally over the next eight months. Related Reading: XRP Funding Levels Drop To Extreme Negative Levels, What This Means For Price From the current price range near $1.35, a similar gain would push XRP well above the $2 threshold. The chart shows that past capitulation phases were followed by expanding candles and stronger upward momentum once selling pressure eased. If the recent -908 million realized loss spike represents a similar emotional extreme to the one observed in 2022, it could indicate that downside pressure is diminishing and a recovery may be approaching.

    "title": "AI Explains What’s Driving The Ethereum Price Volatility, Can It Rise Above $3,000 Again?",
    "body": "A recent technical breakdown shared by crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade added a notable outlook to the discussion of how fast Ethereum can enter into a bull run or if there’s more consolidation ahead. In his post on X, he compared Ethereum against the US Dollar Index and then consulted Perplexity AI for a data-backed explanation of the relationship. The result was a match of DXY peaks and Ethereum bottoms, pointing to a recurring inverse pattern that may now be coming back into play. Ethereum’s Volatility Tied To The Dollar Index The technical analysis from Trader Tardigrade focuses on the inverse relationship between Ethereum and the US Dollar Index (DXY). Ethereum’s monthly candlestick price chart shows that the price structure is layered against DXY movements, with four major phases where peaks in the dollar coincided with Ethereum cycle bottoms and the reverse dynamic played out as well. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Third Time Breakout Could Send Price On 2,000% Rally To $2 A quick look at the chart shows that downtrends in the DXY have, more often than not, coincided with uptrends in the Ethereum price. According to explanations by Perplexity AI, ETH has one of the clearest inverse relationships to DXY in the crypto market, in some cases even more pronounced than Bitcoin. Whenever the dollar is strengthening, capital rotates to perceived safe assets, and risk assets such as Ethereum face selling pressure. On the other hand, when DXY weakens, liquidity conditions ease, and this encourages inflows into cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. According to the analyst, DXY has now broken down from long-term support and looks ready for further declines. The DXY is currently at 97.8 and weakening. That could spark a major rally in crypto in the coming weeks, especially ETH. Chart Image From X. Source: @TATrader_Alan On X AI Breakdown: How Much Of ETH’s Moves Does DXY Explain? In the AI-backed explanation, Perplexity pointed out that the inverse correlation between ETH and DXY can account for roughly 40% to 60% of Ethereum’s volatility, particularly during periods of changes in monetary policy. That figure is always more significant during rate hikes and news events, although there are lags of days to months depending on the catalyst. Related Reading: Mapping Out XRP’s Path To $1,200: Analyst Shares Insights The historical table referenced in the analysis linked specific DXY highs to ETH turning points. For example, during the March 2020 dollar spike, Ethereum bottomed before staging a multi-month rally as the DXY continued to fall to 89. Another alignment was observed in 2022 when the dollar topped at a multi-year high during a broader risk-asset capitulation phase. This, in turn, led to Ethereum creating a bear market low. If the current DXY breakdown extends, then it could begin to favor inflows into Ethereum again. The green projection arcs on the chart suggest that a sustained dollar decline may open the door to another expansion phase in ETH, where the price expands above $10,000. In order for Ethereum to rise above $3,000 again, there would need to be confirmation of sustained dollar weakness with improving on-chain and derivatives metrics.

    "title": "Expert Crypto Trader Predicts The Exact Year Bitcoin Will Reach $250,000",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s long-term price outlook is a major talking point, with veteran trader Peter Brandt recently floating a bold timeline for when the leading cryptocurrency could hit $250,000. The comment came in response to a chart shared on X by NBA legend Scottie Pippen, who showed how Bitcoin’s current structure looks familiar. Brandt not only agreed with Pippen, he also attached a projection that points to a specific year for a when the Bitcoin price will eventually trade above $250,000. Power Law Projection Points To 2029 Breakout According to veteran financial analyst Peter Brandt, Bitcoin is on track to setting off to $250,000-plus by late 2029. He only noted this with a simple sentence, but the projection to $250,000 is visible in the weekly candlestick price chart he shared alongside his prediction. Related Reading: Don’t Fall For The Bitcoin Trap: Analyst Explains Why Recovery To $76,000 Is Not A Good Thing The chart shared by Brandt shows Bitcoin trading within a broad upward-sloping channel that has defined its macrostructure for over a decade. The lower boundary, highlighted in green, appears to act as a recurring support zone during major consolidations. The upper red band connects the different peaks over the years. The current structure is playing out in a way where Bitcoin has been trending downwards after a strong multi-year advance that peaked in late 2025. Brandt’s projection extends the channel forward into 2029, where the middle band of the channel intersects near the $250,000 price level. $250,000 is a recurring Bitcoin price target among crypto participants, although the predictions have different timelines as to when Bitcoin will reach this price level. For instance, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee is also of the notion that Bitcoin will trade at $250,000 soon, although this came with a warning. Analysts at Galaxy Digital have also floated the same target, although on a faster timeline around 2027. That projection, however, came with expectations of an unstable 2026 before any strong rally. Scottie Pippen’s 2020 Comparison Brandt’s forecast was triggered by Scottie Pippen’s post comparing Bitcoin’s current setup to its 2020 structure. In Pippen’s side-by-side chart comparison, the left panel shows Bitcoin’s CME Futures in mid-2020 forming a base before launching into the rally that culminated in the 2021 highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready To Bounce Again? The Major Accumulation Trend You Should Be Aware Of The right panel, which shows current price action in 2026, depicts a similar consolidation pattern above a green support zone. The visual comparison suggests that Bitcoin is now in a comparable pre-breakout phase like it was in 2020. In 2020, Bitcoin consolidated for months before breaking into a parabolic move. As such, although the long-term view is bullish, there’s a high probability that Bitcoin will continue to consolidate around its current price level before going on an aggressive 2021-style rally. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is consolidating below $70,000. The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading at $66,150, having lost 1.8% of its value in the past 24 hours.

    "title": "World Liberty Financial Cites ‘Coordinated Attack’ — But Are There Deeper Issues?",
    "body": "World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the decentralized finance (DeFi) venture associated with President Donald Trump and his sons, said early Monday that it had been targeted in what it described as a “coordinated attack” involving its stablecoin, USD1. According to CoinGecko data, USD1 — which carries a market capitalization of nearly $4.8 billion — briefly lost its dollar peg before recovering to $1. The temporary dislocation drew immediate attention across crypto markets, particularly given the project’s political ties and growing profile within the digital asset sector. World Liberty Financial Addresses Incident In a statement posted on its official account on X (previously Twitter), the project alleged that multiple attack vectors were deployed simultaneously. “A coordinated attack was launched against USD1 this morning,” WLFI wrote. The team claimed that hackers compromised several cofounder accounts, paid influencers to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), and opened significant short positions in the WLFI token in an attempt to profit from market disruption. Related Reading: Why The XRP Price Bottom Could Be In, And A Jump Above $2 Is Coming A spokesperson for World Liberty told Bloomberg that the company’s engineering and security teams had successfully countered the incident. The spokesperson described the event as a multi‑pronged attempt to undermine confidence in the project, but said internal systems functioned as intended. Beyond the temporary depeg itself, online speculation quickly shifted toward another development that some community members believe could be connected. A social media user known as Chris Coffee suggested that the alleged attack might relate to a forthcoming insider trading investigation teased by on‑chain investigator ZachXBT. Insider Probe Speculation Grows ZachXBT announced on X that he plans to publish a report on February 26 detailing alleged insider trading by employees of “one of the most profitable crypto companies.” The timing has fueled conjecture. Some users pointed to reports that Eric Trump, who has been publicly supportive of WLFI, deleted several posts related to the project following the stablecoin’s volatility. He later posted again about WLFI, further drawing attention to the situation. In crypto circles, speculation intensified that World Liberty Financial could be the subject of the pending investigation, though no evidence has been presented to confirm such claims. Related Reading: Expert Crypto Trader Predicts The Exact Year Bitcoin Will Reach $250,000 The conversation has even extended to prediction markets. On Polymarket, bettors are placing odds on which company ZachXBT’s investigation might target. Current probabilities cited on the platform assign roughly a 20% chance to Pump.fun, 18% to World Liberty Financial, and 14% to Binance. For now, there is no confirmed link between Monday’s reported “coordinated attack” on USD1 and the investigation scheduled for release on February 26. Whether the two events are related or simply coincidental remains uncertain. As of this writing, the company’s native token, WLIF, is trading at $0.1121. This represents a 66% gap between the current trading price and the token’s all-time high of $0.33. Featured image from Sky, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Solana (SOL) Loses Critical Support as Crypto Weakness Deepens, Fresh Lows Ahead?",
    "body": "Solana’s (SOL) latest price decline is unfolding against a broader period of weakness across the digital asset market, with traders increasingly shifting toward risk-off positioning. Related Reading: Ready For A 443% Dogecoin Move? The Meme Coin Just Touched A Historically Explosive Level After weeks of steady losses, SOL has slipped below key technical levels, raising questions about whether current support can hold or if another leg lower is approaching. Market data shows declining trader confidence, rising short positioning, and weakening on-chain profitability. According to data tracked on CoinMarketCap, Solana recently traded in the high-$70 range after failing to maintain momentum above $95 earlier in the year. The move extends a six-week losing streak and places the asset near critical support zones that analysts say will likely determine the next directional move. SOL's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Derivatives Markets Signal Growing Downside Risk Open interest in Solana futures fell roughly 2% to about $5.09 billion, even as trading volume surged sharply. This combination often indicates liquidations rather than fresh buying activity. Also, funding rates have turned negative, and the long-to-short ratio has dropped below 1, suggesting more traders are positioning for further dips. Short bias has also appeared among larger accounts despite retail traders maintaining leveraged long exposure on exchanges such as Binance and OKX. Analysts warn that this imbalance could increase the risk of additional volatility if support levels fail. Technically, Solana remains below major moving averages, while momentum indicators continue trending downward. RSI readings near oversold territory reflect sustained selling pressure rather than confirmed reversal signals. On-Chain Data Shows Weakening Holder Confidence On-chain metrics support the cautious outlook. Figures from Glassnode indicate that only about 20% of Solana addresses are currently in profit, the lowest level since late 2023. During previous market downturns, similar readings appeared closer to capitulation phases, suggesting downside risk may not yet be exhausted. Long-term holder accumulation, which strengthened earlier in the year, has slowed notably as the price dropped below $100. Analysts interpret this as declining conviction among investors who previously absorbed supply during pullbacks. Key Levels Traders Are Watching Chart data shows immediate support clustered between $75 and $67. A decisive break below this region could expose lower targets near $62 or even $60 if selling accelerates. On the upside, recovery attempts face resistance around $82–$83, where a bearish trend line has formed. Related Reading: Political Meme Coins Implode: TRUMP Down 92%, MELANIA Nearly Wiped Out Solana’s outlook hinges on whether buyers can defend the February lows. Without a sustained reclaim of higher resistance zones, market structure suggests the broader downtrend remains intact as crypto market uncertainty continues to weigh on sentiment.

    "title": "Bitcoin Wipes Out Gains, Sentiment Sinks To Historic Fear: Analysts",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s recent wobble has traders on edge, but the picture is not all one-way. Reports note heavy losses for late buyers, and on-chain figures show real money changing hands as positions are forced closed. Markets moved fast; the mood did too. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Rare On-Chain Signal That Once Preceded 114% Gains Fear And Greed Plunges To Single Digits According to CoinGlass, more than 144,839 traders were liquidated in the last 24 hours, with total liquidations of over $508 million and about 92% tied to long bets. Reports from Alternative.me put the Crypto Fear and Greed Index at 5 out of 100 — a reading that has turned up only three times since 2018. That level screams panic. Yet panic often clears out the most fragile holders and leaves room for steadier hands to step in. Realized Losses And Capitulation Signals Based on reports from Glassnode, recent investors are still booking losses at a high rate — the seven-day moving average for net realized losses was close to $500 million per day. That kind of selling pressure looks brutal on a chart. At the same time, selling at scale can mark an end to a sharp phase of decline, because it reduces the number of people left to sell when prices fall further. Bitcoin Price Action In the middle of all this, price moves matter. Bitcoin rose to roughly $68,600 on Saturday, but it slid back and touched the mid-$64,000s after a wave of exits. Traders are watching a range that formed after the early-February drop to about $60,000. The coin remains roughly 48% below an October high of $126,000 and about 5.5% under the 2021 peak near $69,000. News tied to US-Iran tension and general risk-off trading pushed some traders toward safer assets, which added fuel to the pullback. Sharpe Ratio Hits Unusual Low Analyst Michaël van de Poppe shared a chart showing Bitcoin’s Sharpe Ratio at -38.4. That metric measures returns relative to risk; a number this low is rare. This is a phenomenal chart. It shows the Sharpe Ratio for #Bitcoin in the short term. The key takeaway: the Sharpe Ratio has dropped to -38.38, which historically has marked “Low Risk” accumulation zones. The red circles highlight every time the Sharpe Ratio dipped to similar… pic.twitter.com/Nwp7SkfVP4 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) February 21, 2026 Historically, extreme negative readings have sometimes lined up with moments when buying risk felt lower, because potential downside had been squeezed out by big selloffs. That does not guarantee a rebound, but it changes how investors view the trade-off between reward and risk. Related Reading: Political Meme Coins Implode: TRUMP Down 92%, MELANIA Nearly Wiped Out Where This Could Lead Some technical watchers warn that more tests of support could happen if uncertainty continues. Others point to the combination of heavy liquidations, deep fear readings, and large realized losses as signals that a base might be forming.

    "body": "XRP is facing one of its most difficult stretches in years, with price action, on-chain data, and derivatives activity pointing to a market under pressure. Related Reading: Ready For A 443% Dogecoin Move? The Meme Coin Just Touched A Historically Explosive Level After weeks of steady declines, the token has now recorded its sharpest weekly downturn since 2022, triggering renewed debate among analysts over whether the sell-off marks the start of a deeper correction or the late stages of a broader market shakeout. Currently, XRP is trading near the $1.33–$1.36 range, down roughly 30% over the past month and more than 60% below its July 2025 peak of $3.65. The decline mirrors weakness across the wider digital asset market, where risk appetite has remained subdued amid macroeconomic uncertainty. XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Capitulation Signals Emerge as Losses Spike One of the most closely watched developments is the surge in realized losses across the network. On-chain data shows investors locked in nearly $1.93 billion in losses over the past week, the largest spike in about 39 months. Realized losses occur when holders sell below their purchase price, often during panic-driven sell-offs. Historically, similar events have coincided with market capitulation phases, where short-term holders exit positions and tokens shift toward longer-term investors. A comparable spike in 2022 was followed by a significant recovery months later, though analysts caution that past performance does not guarantee a repeat. Despite falling prices, trading activity has increased. Spot trading volume jumped above $2.3 billion in 24 hours, while futures volume and open interest also climbed, suggesting traders are actively positioning rather than leaving the market. Key Levels and the “Shakeout” Narrative Technically, the $1.30 level has become a critical support zone. XRP briefly slipped below it before recovering, indicating buying interest remains present. However, analysts warn that a confirmed breakdown could open the path toward $1.20 or even the psychological $1.00 level. Some market watchers argue that the current structure resembles previous consolidation phases that preceded strong rallies. According to this view, another decline toward the $1.10 area remains possible as markets get rid of weaker participants before any sustained move higher. Momentum indicators also reflect pressure. XRP continues trading below key moving averages, and while the relative strength index suggests oversold conditions, no confirmed bullish reversal has formed yet. Structural Factors Shift Focus Toward Q2 Beyond short-term price action, attention is increasingly turning to structural developments that could influence performance later in 2026. Analysts point to improving regulatory clarity, institutional positioning, and planned upgrades to the XRP Ledger aimed at supporting tokenized assets, lending functions, and compliant trading environments.

    "title": "Another $438M In Crypto Longs Gone As Bitcoin, Altcoins Pull Back",
    "body": "Data shows cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges have racked up liquidations as Bitcoin and other assets have gone through a price retrace. Crypto Liquidations Have Crossed $500 Million During The Past Day According to data from CoinGlass, a massive amount of liquidations have piled up on digital asset derivatives platforms following the latest market volatility. “Liquidation” refers to the forceful closure that any open contract undergoes after it has incurred a loss of a specific degree (as defined by the exchange). Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Fear Streak Extends To 22 Days As Price Struggles Fast, violent moves tend to catch a large number of contracts off guard at once, so mass liquidation events tend to accompany them. The same has been the case with the volatility shown by Bitcoin and the company during the past day. As the table below shows, about $507 million in derivatives contracts have been liquidated over the last 24 hours. $438 million or 86% of the liquidations involved long contracts. This overwhelming majority in the leverage flush from the bullish bets is naturally because of the fact that the sharpest move inside this window was one to the downside. Bitcoin went from $67,700 to a low of $64,300 within the matter of a few hours. As the market has rebounded since this plunge, some short investors have also been liquidated, with their 24-hour liquidation figure sitting at $69 million. In terms of the individual assets, Bitcoin was once again the biggest contributor to the derivatives flush, with $233 million in contracts involved. Below is a heatmap that shows how liquidations have looked for the other coins. On-chain analytics firm Santiment has made an X post discussing the volatility, noting that it has caused a drop in the Bitcoin Open Interest. This indicator measures the total amount of positions related to BTC (in USD) that are currently open on all derivatives exchanges. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest plunged to $19.5 billion following the event, which is about half the level that the metric was at during the January peak of $38.3 billion. The indicator’s decline signifies a mix of liquidations and investors choosing to pull back on risk. Related Reading: Bitcoin Big-Money Exits: Large-Holder Supply Hits Lowest Since May 2025 In the same chart, Santiment has also attached the data for the Negative Sentiment, a metric that tracks the degree of bearish sentiment around BTC on the major social media platforms.

    "body": "Dogecoin has pushed a cycle-style positioning metric to a level never seen before in its history, and the chart’s context suggests the market has only been in comparable territory twice, both times near major cycle lows. Alphractal founder and CEO Joao Wedson said DOGE has now crossed a key threshold in his “Number of Days Spent at a Profit” indicator. “For the first time, Dogecoin has accumulated more than 1,100 days in the past where the price was higher than today’s level,” Wedson wrote on X alongside the chart. “The Number of Days Spent at a Profit measures how many historical days traded above the current price, reflecting market memory and the aggregated positioning of holders over time. The higher the value, the longer the historical period that was traded at levels above the current price.” Related Reading: Ready For A 443% Dogecoin Move? The Meme Coin Just Touched A Historically Explosive Level The indicator is straightforward: it counts how many prior days in DOGE’s trading history printed prices above the current level. A higher reading implies today’s price sits below a larger share of Dogecoin’s historical “tape,” which can be interpreted as an expanded footprint of prior trading levels above spot—what Wedson calls “market memory.” What This Could Mean For Dogecoin The chart adds an important historical tell. Before this latest surge toward the 1,100+ day milestone, Dogecoin only moved above the 800-day level twice. Those two instances occurred around the March 2020 bottom and the October 2023 bottom, according to the chart and Wedson’s framing. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Faces Critical Test As $0.074 Support Comes Into Focus In both historical cases, the move above 800 days coincided with a major turning point that was followed by parabolic runs in subsequent months. From the March 2020 low to the November 2021 peak, DOGE rallied from about $0.0011 to its all-time high near $0.76, a gain of more than 65,000%. From the October 2023 low to December 2024, DOGE rose roughly 750%, climbing from about $0.0569 to $0.4846. Wedson emphasized that this is not a signal about an intraday swing but a longer-horizon condition. “This is a structural cycle metric, not just a short-term move,” he said—positioning the new 1,100+ day milestone as a regime-level datapoint about where today’s price sits versus Dogecoin’s historical distribution. The open question from here is whether this unprecedented reading will behave like prior extremes, where elevated “days above current price” aligned with cycle lows, or whether the market’s current structure breaks that historical rhyme. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.09705. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",
