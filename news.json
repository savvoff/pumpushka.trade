    "title": "Ethereum Price Slips Below $2,500 — Here Are The Next Support Levels",
    "body": "The Ethereum price has been under intense bearish pressure over the past few weeks, reflecting the overall fragile state of the cryptocurrency market. The altcoin lost nearly 20% of its value in the past week, free-falling under the psychological $3,000 level since Thursday, January 29th. With the market still showing signs of further downside risk, there is no telling how deep the Ethereum price will fall in the current bearish setup. However, the latest on-chain data has offered insights into the next critical levels for the second-largest cryptocurrency. ETH’s Next Support Stands At $2,475: Glassnode In a recent post on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified the next three on-chain support levels for the Ethereum price. This on-chain evaluation revolves around the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric, which helps to pinpoint strong resistance and support levels based on investor cost bases. Related Reading: Ripple’s David Schwartz Shuts Down Claims Of XRP Hitting $100 For context, an investor’s cost basis refers to the actual price at which they purchased a particular cryptocurrency (Ethereum, in this scenario). Typically, the ability of a price level to function as an on-chain support or resistance zone depends on the number of investors who have their cost basis at the given level. As inferred earlier, the UTXO Realized Price Distribution tracks the amount of a particular cryptocurrency that was acquired at a specific price level. Now, the price levels below the present spot value with significant trading activity are often considered as major support zones, as shown in the chart below. The reasoning behind this expectation is that investors with their cost bases around these price levels are likely to double down on their positions and purchase more coins. This increased buying activity will, hence, offer a cushion for the Ethereum price to stay afloat and potentially bounce back. Highlighting data from Glassnode, Martinez identified the $2,623, $2,475, and $1,881 levels as the next crucial support zones for the Ethereum price after losing the $2,772 mark. However, it appears that the altcoin’s price has also lost the $2,623 and $2,475 support following its latest decline over the weekend. Ethereum Price Overview As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,410, reflecting an over 10% decline in the past 24 hours. With this latest decline, the altcoin’s price seems to be hovering around the support cushion at around $2,475. If ETH’s stay below this support level is sustained, investors could see the Ethereum price fall to as low as $1,881. A fall of this magnitude would represent a 25% decline from the current price point and an over 60% correction from the cycle high.

    "title": "Bitcoin Breaks Key Support, Analyst Signals Lower Levels Ahead",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s price action has fallen into bearish territory after dropping below an important previous low that had supported the rally for months. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $78,560 after falling to as low as $77,082 in the past 24 hours, a move that crypto analyst XForceGlobal says represents a significant change in the technical structure. According to his detailed Elliott Wave analysis shared on X, the price action has now invalidated the bullish framework many traders were relying on, and lower levels are becoming more likely in the coming weeks and months. Related Reading: Ethereum Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech Breakdown Below Previous Low Changes Primary Wave Count According to XForceGlobal, Bitcoin had been working through a complex sideways structure, specifically a WXY combination that was expected to resolve through distribution rather than outright breakdown. Bulls managed to complete three of the five required components of this triangle-like structure, but the failure to defend the prior low was the signal that led to a structural shift. This prior low refers to the $82,000 low in November 2025. Bitcoin bulls failed to defend this low when the price action broke below $80,000 in the most recent 24 hours. Once that level gave way, the primary wave count could no longer be maintained. In terms of the Elliott Wave count, that lower low means that price action from the all-time high should now be treated as separated and corrective, not part of a healthy continuation. This restructuring gives the current decline more room to develop from a Fibonacci extension perspective and changes how minimum and maximum downside targets should be evaluated. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: @XForceGlobal On X Two Bearish Scenarios Point To The Same Zone The resulting analysis shows two main scenarios of how Bitcoin’s price action can continue from here, both of which are converging on similar downside levels. The first is a flat correction, where Bitcoin is currently unfolding a C wave. Although XForceGlobal describes this as the least attractive option, it would still imply a full distribution range that invalidates a bullish structure and drags the Bitcoin price to as low as $60,000. The second scenario is a macro ending diagonal structured as a WXY move to the downside. This scenario uses the October 2025 all-time high above $126,000 as a cut point to improve wave separation of the current price action. Interestingly, the price projection from this scenario also aligns with targets in the same $60,000 area. Despite different technical paths, both interpretations point to comparable downside risk over the medium timeframe. Related Reading: Crypto Funds Bleed $1.80 Billion As Metals Rally Heats Up Now that the larger structure is now compromised, XForceGlobal says it makes sense to adopt a shorter-timeframe bearish bias while reorganizing the next wave count. The outlook is that Bitcoin continues its decline to at least $60,000 before rebounding to stage a return above $100,000. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Crypto Hacks Explode: $370 Million Stolen In January Alone: Researchers",
    "body": "The start of this year brought a hard reminder: people remain the weakest link. Reports note that roughly $370 million in crypto were taken in January, a sharp climb from earlier months. Related Reading: Crypto Funds Bleed $1.80 Billion As Metals Rally Heats Up That surge was driven mostly by one massive social-engineering con that emptied a single victim of about $284 million. Simple lies and well-crafted messages beat code this time. Phishing Dominates Losses According to CertiK, phishing-style scams grabbed about $311 million of the January haul. That means most losses came from attackers tricking users and insiders rather than breaking cryptographic systems. Social pressure, fake links, and impersonation were used to push victims into moving funds. People clicked. Money moved. Accounts were drained. A Bigger Picture Of Monthly Swings Based on reports, January’s total is nearly four times the $98 million stolen in January 2025 and more than triple December’s close to $118 million. The month is the largest since February 2025, when roughly $1.5 billion was taken, most of that tied to the huge Bybit heist. Those big events show how a single breach or scam can tilt an entire month’s tally. Numbers can look calm one month and explosive the next. That unpredictability keeps wallets and treasuries on edge. #CertiKStatsAlert 🚨 Combining all the incidents in January we’ve confirmed ~$370.3M lost to exploits. ~$311.3M of the total is attributed to phishing with one victim losing ~$284M due to a social engineering scam. More details below 👇 pic.twitter.com/uXhi0P6dl5 — CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) January 31, 2026 Major Technical Exploits Hit Treasuries PeckShield flagged several large protocol attacks. Step Finance lost nearly $29 million after treasury wallets were compromised and over 261,000 SOL vanished. Truebit suffered a $26.4 million hit when a smart contract flaw allowed near-free minting, which also crushed its token price. SwapNet and Saga were among other victims, with losses around $13.3 million and $7 million respectively. Those hacks were technical, aggressive, and fast. #PeckShieldAlert In Jan. 2026, the crypto space saw 16 hacks totaling $86.01M in losses, representing a slight 1.42% YoY decrease compared to Jan. 2025 ($87.25M) but a notable 13.25% MoM surge from Dec. 2025 ($75.95M). Meanwhile, #phishing remains staggering with losses… pic.twitter.com/pxugbsPcZ7 — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) February 1, 2026 Why This Matters Now Reports say there were 40 exploit and scam incidents over January, though the bulk of value lost was concentrated in a few cases. That pattern means the raw count of incidents doesn’t tell the whole story; a single, well-executed con can dwarf many smaller breaches combined. Some months will show many small thefts. Other months will be defined by one enormous fraud. What Needs To Change Security teams and project treasuries must tighten both human and technical safeguards. More rigorous wallet controls, staged approvals, and stronger identity checks would blunt social-engineering strikes. At the same time, independent code audits and quicker response plans can limit damage from smart contract bugs. Education programs for staff and users are cheap compared with the cost of a single large loss. Related Reading: Gold Vs. XRP: One Asset Just Added 20x The Other’s Market Value The recent spike is a clear message: attackers are mixing social skill with technical know-how. The playbook now often starts with a message in a chat app or an email, then turns into code-level theft. Patching software helps. Teaching people how to spot scams will stop many attacks before they ever reach the code. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "XRP Price Falls Below $1.6: You Won’t Believe What Institutions Are Doing Amid The Crash",
    "body": "Crypto pundit X Finance Bull has highlighted how institutions are accumulating XRP amid the crypto market crash. His comment comes amid the XRP price drop below the psychological $1.6 level, which has further sparked bearish sentiments among retail investors. Institutions Are Still Accumulating Amid XRP Price Crash In an X post, X Finance Bull noted that while retail investors are panicking over the XRP price crash, institutional investors continue to accumulate the Ripple-linked token. The crypto pundit pointed to inflows into XRP ETFs, while Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs continue to see outflows. Based on this, he stated that the rotation is starting, with institutional investors moving from BTC and ETH to XRP.

Meanwhile, the XRP ETFs recorded a net inflow of $15.6 million. X Finance Bull noted that these inflows might be small now, but that direction matters. He further remarked that institutions don’t chase hype in choppy markets but rather position for fundamentals. The crypto pundit also noted that inflows into XRP ETFs, while Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are bleeding, aren’t random. He highlighted fundamentals that are bullish for the XRP price despite the current market crash. This includes the token’s cross-border payments utility, which he noted solves a “Quadrillion-dollar problem.” He added that regulatory clarity is coming and that infrastructure is already in place. X Finance Bull expects the XRP price to be among the first to recover when the market rebounds, noting that capital flows to utility. He added that the smart money is already front-running that shift. The crypto pundit also believes that those investing in XRP now are still early, given that the XRP ETFs have just recorded $1.18 billion cumulative inflows in three months. Two Potential Paths For The Altcoin At The Moment Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has highlighted two paths for the XRP price following its drop below $1.60. He stated that the first path is a double liquidity grab, whereby a relief bounce happens from here, followed by a second liquidity sweep and then an expansion. His accompanying chart showed that the second liquidity sweep could happen around $1.3. Meanwhile, the second path of the XRP price is a direct expansion, which aligns with the cycle fractal. Egrag Crypto stated that if history rhymes, the altcoin could record a 340% gain, similar to the 2021 bull cycle, or a larger 1,600% gain, similar to the 2017 bull cycle. A 340% surge and a 1,600% surge would put XRP at $7 and $27, respectively.

    "title": "Bitcoin Price Crash To $76,000: Why This Analyst Is Warning Against Buying",
    "body": "Since the recent Bitcoin price crash to $76,000, the broader crypto market has been on high alert, with sentiment shifting to extreme fear levels. A crypto analyst who has shared insights on Bitcoin’s latest market movements predicts more pain for the leading cryptocurrency. He has also warned investors against taking advantage of the decline and buying BTC during this highly volatile and unpredictable period. Analyst Warns Not To Go Long After Bitcoin Price Crash Crypto analyst Tyrex has warned investors against going long on Bitcoin following the recent price crash. Over the weekend, BTC experienced another devastating decline, dropping by more than 14% according to CoinMarketCap. For some investors, this drop may appear as an opportunity to buy the dip and go long on the leading cryptocurrency. However, Tyrex advises against making such a move. Related Reading: XRP Prints Bullish Divergence On The Weekly Chart, But Is ATHs Still Possible? The analyst stated in an X post on February 1, 2026, that Bitcoin had crashed to a new low around $76,000 on January 31, confirming a bearish breakout. He noted that, based on past market movements in which similar setups occurred, excluding fakeouts, Bitcoin is highly unlikely to stage a full recovery back to $85,000. Instead, he said the price is more likely to keep dumping until it completes its downside move and reaches a price discovery at lower levels. Tyrex cited Bitcoin’s price action in May 2021, May 2022, and June 22, noting that massive price crashes occurred during these periods after similar breaks in market structure. He said Bitcoin failed to recover quickly in each case and actually continued to crash on the daily chart after the main red candle was printed. The analyst’s accompanying Bitcoin chart shows the cryptocurrency trading above $79,000 at the time of his analysis, after it initiated a slight recovery from its previous low near $76,000. He projected on the chart that Bitcoin could soon resume its decline and fall toward the $75,400 region, representing a more than 4.5% decline. Tyrex added that a major support level sits around the $74,000 level on the weekly chart, which could temporarily hold off further downside. According to Tyrex, this level is equivalent to a key support near $2,100 for Ethereum. Related Reading: Analyst Says Chainlink Price Could Crash 50% If This Level Fails Analyst Shares Highly Likely BTC Decline In his analysis, Tyrex stated that, given Bitcoin’s latest price crash, structural weakness, and past cycle trends, he expects the cryptocurrency to retest recent lows once again. Considering his view that a recovery is unlikely, the analyst suggests that the near-term outlook for BTC is predominantly bearish. He noted that the $74,000 support is the main area for potential long positions. However, he expressed caution, noting that this level may not be particularly strong since it is relatively distant on the weekly chart and could be broken if Bitcoin continues its downward trend.
