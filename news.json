    "title": "Dogecoin Is Now In The ‘Maximum Opportunity / Minimum Risk’ Zone: Crypto Analyst",
    "body": "Dogecoin is flashing what crypto analyst Cryptollica (@Cryptollica) calls on X a rare “maximum opportunity / minimum risk” setup, as long-horizon indicators on a DOGE-versus-dollar proxy chart push into levels that previously coincided with cycle lows. Why This Could Be The ‘Maximum Opportunity’ For Dogecoin In a Feb. 11 post on X, Cryptollica shared a 10-day DOGE chart denominated against the US Dollar Index (DXY), arguing the slower timeframe “filters out the intraday noise and reveals the true cyclical nature of the asset.” The analyst framed the move as a reset back to a historically important base level and pointed to momentum readings that, in past cycles, marked capitulation. Related Reading: Why Dogecoin (DOGE) Can’t Break $0.10 Despite Short-Term Bounce and Neutral RSI At the center of Cryptollica’s thesis is a black horizontal line on the DOGE/DXY 10-day chart — a level the analyst described as the historic “Launchpad.” “The black horizontal line represents the historic ‘Launchpad.’ In early 2021, this level was the breakout resistance that ignited the bull run (ELON),” Cryptollica wrote. “In 2022, 2023, and now 2026, this same level is acting as a macro support fortress. Price has returned to its origin.” That framing leans on a classic market-structure idea: prior resistance that becomes support can act as a memory point for positioning and risk-taking, especially when the market revisits it after a full boom-bust loop. Cryptollica also highlighted the 10-day RSI sitting at 34, referencing a “red line” zone on the indicator. The claim: when DOGE’s RSI reached that same zone in prior stress periods, including 2015, March 2020, and 2022, it preceded meaningful rebounds. “Every time the RSI touched this zone (2015, March 2020 (covid crash), 2022), it marked a cyclical bottom followed by a significant rally,” Cryptollica wrote. “We are mathematically in the ‘Maximum Opportunity / Minimum Risk’ zone.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Bear Market Almost Over? Crypto Analyst Weighs In The post stops short of calling for immediate upside, but the language suggests the analyst sees skew shifting: less perceived downside relative to the potential upside if a new expansion phase begins. Is The Dogecoin Bottom In? In a separate chart shared on Wednesday, Cryptollica mapped DOGE/USDT on a 3-day timeframe, sketching a wide channel with a labeled TopLine, Midline, and BottomLine. The chart annotates prior turning points around $0.75, $0.49, $0.22, and $0.09, with price now drifting back toward the lower boundary near the $0.07–$0.08 area. Cryptollica captioned the second image simply: “DOGE BOTTOM ?” Taken together, the posts lay out a conditional thesis rather than a timed call: DOGE has rotated back to a historically important support reference on a macro-style pair (DOGE/DXY), while momentum sits in a zone that previously aligned with cycle inflection points. Whether that historical rhyme turns into a repeat will likely hinge on whether the “launchpad” support holds and whether DOGE can reclaim higher range levels marked on the longer timeframe channel rather than continuing to bleed along the bottom boundary. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.09366. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin May Already Be Entering Crypto Winter, Researchers Warn",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s recent slide has left traders squinting at charts and asking the same blunt question: correction or crash? Prices have tumbled sharply, but some market watchers still see this as a deep pullback inside a longer uptrend. Others warn the data points to something colder. Related Reading: Jim Cramer Suggests US Government Could Buy Bitcoin Near $60K Price Decline And Hard Numbers According to XWIN Research’s CryptoQuant analysis, Bitcoin has fallen about 46% from a peak near $126,000 and now trades around $67,900 after five straight months of losses. The Fear & Greed Index sits at 14 — a reading labeled Extreme Fear. Reports note that net realized losses recently hit over $13 billion, a level that matched the worst stretches of the 2022 slump. In 2024, roughly $10 billion of inflows helped lift market cap. Then in 2025, more than $300 billion flowed in while the overall market value shrank. That odd mix of heavy inflows and falling market cap suggests selling pressure is higher than fresh buying. How Rising Prices Are Masking a Quiet Shift in Bitcoin’s Structure “The base scenario is that Bitcoin may already be entering winter, with higher prices and stronger structure delaying recognition.” – By @xwinfinance Read more ⤵️https://t.co/7soxNoBhqi pic.twitter.com/fEsSXpAmuK — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 11, 2026 Capital Flows Versus Price Action Based on reports, the capital flow numbers are the most awkward fact for bulls. Money moved in, but value fell. Who was selling into that demand? Large holders, paper traders, or complex derivatives desks might have taken profits or hedged positions. The data alone doesn’t name the seller, but the pattern is a red flag. On-chain measures also reveal shrinking realized gains even as prices remained far above prior bear-era levels. That tends to weaken the internal strength of the market over time. Sentiment And Historical Echoes Some traders point to a quirk of memory: high nominal prices make pain feel milder. People don’t want to relive the chaos of 2022. Reports say the launch of spot ETFs and deeper institutional access have changed the market’s plumbing, and that gives many confidence. Yet sentiment readings at extreme fear often show up near capitulation points. It’s worth remembering that in 2022 realized losses peaked about five months before the market bottom, which means big losses can precede a final low by a long stretch. Technical Patterns And The Bigger Picture Bitcoin posted four consecutive losing months and a 41% decline across that stretch — a streak last seen during 2018 rather than 2022. That pattern matters because similar sequences have led to extended downturns in the past. Related Reading: More Bitcoin Ahead: Saylor, Strategy Commit To Regular BTC Purchases Bitcoin At A Crossroads As XWIN Flags Early Signs Of Crypto Winter For XWIN Research, the message is simple: price alone does not define the cycle. What matters is who is buying, who is selling, and whether demand can absorb supply without market value shrinking. Right now, that balance looks strained. Until inflows begin translating into sustained market cap growth and realized losses cool meaningfully, the firm believes the market should be treated with caution rather than optimism. Winter may not have fully arrived, but based on the data, the temperature is clearly dropping. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Leading On-Chain Analyst Sees A Floor Forming",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s violent drawdown into the low-$60,000s has traders hunting for a floor. One of the market’s best-known on-chain analysts is arguing the risk-reward has shifted meaningfully, even if the “bottom” is still a process rather than a single print. James “Checkmate” Check, a former lead Glassnode researcher and now the author of Check On Chain, told What Bitcoin Did host Danny Knowles that once Bitcoin pushed into the $60,000 zone, it entered what he described as “deep value” territory across multiple mean-reversion frameworks, at the same time capitulation-style losses spiked to levels last seen at the 2022 cycle lows. Check’s core framing is blunt: if Bitcoin is headed to zero, none of the models matter. If it’s not, then the statistical setup looks increasingly asymmetric after the selloff. “If Bitcoin is going to zero, been nice playing. It’s been fun have fun playing with your bitcoins,” Check said. “If not, then you start looking at the statistics and the odds and go, ‘Well, if Bitcoin recovers, this is kind of a nice place to be. Don’t lose attention now. This is the time to pay attention.’” Related Reading: These Three Catalysts Could Spark Bitcoin’s Next Rally, According To Wintermute Check was less interested in pinning the move on a single forced seller than in walking through the market structure that made the slide plausible. IS THE BITCOIN BOTTOM IN? | @_Checkmatey_ We discuss: – The Bitcoin Bear Market – If $60k Is The Bottom – What Caused The Crash – How To Manage The Bear Watch it here: https://t.co/j6OTvdnWFc pic.twitter.com/Z0f1VaKkFd — Danny Knowles (@_DannyKnowles) February 11, 2026 Bitcoin Bottoms Are A Process His conclusion was probabilistic, not declarative. “The odds that we’ve put a bottom in have gone up significantly,” he said, adding later that he’d put the chance the market already set a meaningful low at “more than 50/50 […] probably 60%,” while assigning just “15–20%” odds of a new all-time high in 2026 without a major macro “pivot” or “big print” event. On ETFs, Check cited roughly $7.5 billion in outflows during the drawdown, while arguing the bigger picture looked less like a structural failure and more like positioning unwinds. He said that at around $80,000, roughly 62% of cumulative inflows were underwater, but noted ETF assets under management were down only mid-single digits (he referenced about 4–6%), and suggested earlier outflows aligned with CME open interest, consistent with basis-trade window-dressing rolling off. Check pushed back hard on anchoring to the four-year halving cycle as a timing tool, calling it an “unnecessary bias.” His approach: watch investor behavior first, check the calendar second. “Show me when investors put the bottom in. Show me when investors sell the top,” he said. “I’m going to look at that instead because then I’ll check the date.” Even if the low is in, Check expects the market to revisit it. Bottoms, he argued, tend to form through multiple “capitulation wicks” and then “time pain,” where boredom and lingering fear grind down late-cycle buyers. “If you are formulating a bear case right now, you’re doing it wrong,” he said, framing the current zone as the late innings of the move rather than the start, while still allowing price could go lower. He pointed to two failed all-time-high attempts around October, topping near $126,000, followed by a “shot across the bow” crash on Oct. 10 that he said likely left “bodies out there.” From there, he described a “hodler’s wall” of invested wealth sitting above key levels, with $95,000 as what he called the “bull’s last stand” and argued that once price lost those shelves, downside odds accelerated. A key reference level for him was $80,000, tied to the True Market Mean, a long-term center-of-gravity price that also overlapped with the ETF cost basis in his telling. Once that level broke, he said, the psychological regime changed: “Losing $80,000 was the acceptance phase. Now everyone believes that it’s a bear market. And what bear markets do, they trend lower.” From there, Check argued the market was pulled toward the prior high-volume consolidation zone, roughly the mid-$50,000s to $70,000 range, where a large share of this cycle’s trading volume had previously occurred. He said the selloff itself likely involved leverage blowing up somewhere, but framed that as downstream of a broader shift: when the crowd believes it’s a downtrend, they “sell every rip.” The most concrete “bottoming” signal Check emphasized was the scale of realized losses during the flush. He said capitulation losses ran around $1.5 billion per day, a figure he compared directly to the 2022 bottom and that the sellers were concentrated among recent cohorts: “class of 2025” and “class of 2026” buyers, plus people who bought the $80,000 bear-flag region. He also flagged SOPR printing around minus one standard deviation, which he said has only appeared in two historical contexts: an early “this isn’t a dip” warning, and later near bottoming phases. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Luna-Level Capitulation Signal at $67K, Not $19K His conclusion was probabilistic, not declarative. “The odds that we’ve put a bottom in have gone up significantly,” he said, adding later that he’d put the chance the market already set a meaningful low at “more than 50/50 […] probably 60%,” while assigning just “15–20%” odds of a new all-time high in 2026 without a major macro “pivot” or “big print” event. On ETFs, Check cited roughly $7.5 billion in outflows during the drawdown, while arguing the bigger picture looked less like a structural failure and more like positioning unwinds. He said that at around $80,000, roughly 62% of cumulative inflows were underwater, but noted ETF assets under management were down only mid-single digits (he referenced about 4–6%), and suggested earlier outflows aligned with CME open interest, consistent with basis-trade window-dressing rolling off. Check pushed back hard on anchoring to the four-year halving cycle as a timing tool, calling it an “unnecessary bias.” His approach: watch investor behavior first, check the calendar second. “Show me when investors put the bottom in. Show me when investors sell the top,” he said. “I’m going to look at that instead because then I’ll check the date.” Even if the low is in, Check expects the market to revisit it. Bottoms, he argued, tend to form through multiple “capitulation wicks” and then “time pain,” where boredom and lingering fear grind down late-cycle buyers. “If you are formulating a bear case right now, you’re doing it wrong,” he said, framing the current zone as the late innings of the move rather than the start, while still allowing price could go lower.

    "title": "Ethereum Whales Are Not Dead: The $400 Million Move That Shows What’s Going On",
    "body": "Ethereum whales have continued to accumulate despite the current downtrend in the ETH price, providing a bullish outlook for the second-largest crypto by market cap. Notably, ETH withdrawals from exchanges recently reached their highest level since October last year, totaling over $400 million. Ethereum Whales Accelerate Withdrawals From Exchanges Crypto analyst Arab Chain noted in a CryptoQuant analysis that rising Ethereum withdrawals from exchanges have reached their highest level since October. The analyst noted that the exchange netflow data over the past few days indicates a clear acceleration in withdrawal activity. This signals a shift in Ethereum whales’ behavior as demand outpaces supply. Related Reading: Can Ethereum Price Still Hit $7,600 In 2026? Here Are The Odds Arab Chain revealed that across all exchanges, the net Ethereum outflows have exceeded 220,000 ETH, marking the highest level of withdrawals since October last year. This suggests that Ethereum whales are moving their coins to private wallets or long-term storage protocols, a move that the analyst noted is often associated with accumulation phases or risk-reduction behavior. Notably, daily net outflows on Binance reached nearly 158,000 ETH on February 5, the largest since August last year. Arab Chain stated that this confirms that a substantial portion of the recent outflows has been concentrated on the exchange with the deepest liquidity. From a price perspective, the analyst noted that the Ethereum whale accumulation coincided with ETH trading near the $1,800 to $2,000 range. Therefore, these Ethereum whales may see these levels as attractive zones for holding or repositioning amid this crypto market downtrend. Arab Chain added that the continued outflow of ETH from exchanges at this scale reduces immediate selling pressure and could provide near-term support for the ETH price, especially if the market gains momentum again. Ethereum Staking Hits New High According to Token Terminal, Ethereum staking has surpassed 30% of the total supply, marking a new all-time high (ATH) in terms of staking ratio. Market commentator The Milk Road noted that this means that 36.8 million ETH, around $72 billion, is now locked up, with almost 1 million validators securing the network. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Set To Break Out Against Bitcoin, But How High Can It Go? The Milk Road further described this development as a sign of conviction in the Ethereum ecosystem, noting that these whales are willing to lock up $74 billion during a market downtrend. Notably, the staking exit queue is around 4.1 million ETH, which the market commentator remarked is nothing compared to what is currently staked. Interestingly, it also takes about 72 days to stake ETH at the moment, with staking demand at a new high. Meanwhile, the Milk Road also noted that the obvious impact is a significant supply restriction, which is a bullish catalyst for the ETH price. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $1,965, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "XRP Price Could Push Further If It Beats This Resistane – ‘$15 Is On The Radar’",
    "body": "XRP price’s structural positioning is back under the microscope after a well-known market analyst flagged a decisive inflection zone that could determine the asset’s next expansion leg. However, the call centers on whether price can decisively overcome a reclaimed barrier that previously acted as both a milestone and now a ceiling. $2.47 Rejection Defines XRP Price’s Immediate Battlefield The analyst’s thesis traces back to an earlier strategic entry identified near the $0.50 region. From that foundation, XRP advanced to meet the $2.47 target before extending beyond $3.30, producing an estimated +600% appreciation during that impulse phase. Current price behavior, however, reflects a shift in market character. The $2.47 level that once served as an upside objective has now transitioned into overhead resistance. The charts show price stalling beneath this horizontal barrier after a sharp rally, reinforcing it as a supply-dense zone. Related Reading: Is XRP Near a Turning Point? Oversold Readings Clash With Key $1.50 Resistance Reinforcing this view is XRP’s broader historical structure. A long-term chart shared by the analyst highlights a rounded macro base formed after an extended drawdown along a descending curved trendline. Multiple higher lows emerged across that base, signaling progressive demand absorption. A breakout from this compression zone triggered the vertical expansion that ultimately tested the $2.47 region. Now, price is consolidating above prior support shelves while compressing beneath resistance — a configuration more commonly associated with continuation setups than terminal tops. The analyst connects this compression to the early phase of an altcoin cycle rotation, emphasizing that XRP has historically outperformed during periods of sector-wide capital expansion. Alt-Season Tailwind Opens Path To $4.804, Then $15+ The analyst’s forward projection depends on one trigger: a confirmed move back above $2.47. His models indicate that turning this level into support would open the next measured leg, targeting $4.804. From the current positioning, that would mark a gain of more than +230%. Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Has Been In A Consistent Downtrend Since 2025 The projected path on the chart he posted follows a staircase expansion structure — breakout, consolidation, continuation — reflecting XRP’s prior cycle behavior. Horizontal markers above price show interim friction zones, but the trajectory assumes momentum will accelerate once the resistance supply is cleared. Beyond this mid-range objective sits a much larger macro outlook. On a broader view, the analyst points to historical symmetry between XRP’s previous cycle expansion and its current base formation. The scale of the completed accumulation, combined with the curvature of the long-term reversal, supports an extended projection placing $15+ within strategic range. This upper target is not framed as immediate but as a cycle-level radar point dependent on sustained alt-season liquidity, continued higher-low formations, and structural acceptance above reclaimed resistance zones. In execution terms, $2.47 acts as the gateway. Rejection keeps XRP range-bound; acceptance turns the structure into a continuation engine. If wider market conditions align with the analyst’s alt-season thesis, the charts suggest XRP’s expansion phase may remain incomplete — with $4.804 as the next operational milestone and $15+ positioned as the longer-horizon objective.

    "title": "Bitcoin Back At $65,000 — The Two Main Reasons Behind Today’s Market Crash",
    "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) resumed its downward trajectory on Thursday, falling toward $65,645 at the time of writing after once again failing to break through the major $70,000 resistance level. The pullback in the leading cryptocurrency has rippled across the broader digital asset market, with large-cap tokens, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL), posting similar declines. US Recession Signals And Potential Shutdown Market expert Ash Crypto attributed the latest selloff to two primary forces: deteriorating US economic data and the rising likelihood of a federal government shutdown. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Already Pricing A US Recession? Analyst Sees Major Risk‑Reward Setup In a post published on X, he pointed to a series of weak macroeconomic indicators that have raised fresh concerns about the strength of the American economy. US home sales declined by 8.4% last month, marking the sharpest drop in nearly four years. At the same time, initial jobless claims came in higher than expected, signaling potential softness in the labor market. Taken together, these developments suggest the economy may be losing momentum, increasing the risk of a recessionary environment. Compounding those concerns is the growing threat of a government shutdown. According to Ash, the probability of a shutdown occurring this week has surged to 96%. Such an event would likely weigh on both traditional financial markets and cryptocurrencies by tightening liquidity conditions. He argued that the US economy is entering a period of turbulence that is already affecting equities, Bitcoin, and the broader digital asset market. In his view, market weakness could persist until there is a positive catalyst, such as a new trade agreement announced by President Donald Trump or a liquidity injection. Bitcoin At Risk? Technical analyst Crypto Rover shared similar concerns, warning that the “biggest threat to markets” has returned. He described the potential government shutdown as a serious liquidity hazard for financial markets. An additional complicating factor is the recent increase in the US debt ceiling to $41.1 trillion. While raising the ceiling prevents an immediate default, it also gives lawmakers more room to prolong negotiations without instantly halting government functions. According to Rover, this flexibility paradoxically raises the risk of an extended shutdown because neither side faces immediate financial pressure to concede. Related Reading: UNI Rallies 10% As BlackRock Brings Treasury‑Backed BUIDL Token To Uniswap The analyst also pointed to weakening labor market conditions, slowing retail spending, and rising corporate bankruptcies as evidence that the economic backdrop is deteriorating. Ultimately, should a new shutdown materialize and persist for a longer period, the analyst warns that the liquidity drain could be significantly larger, intensifying pressure on both equities and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

    "title": "How Ethereum Could Become The Default Network For AI Development, Vitalik Explains",
    "body": "Ethereum is increasingly positioning itself at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), with growing discussions around its potential to become the default network for AI development. As AI systems demand secure data verification, ETH’s programmable smart contracts and robust ecosystem offer a compelling foundation. Its ability to provide trustless execution, decentralized data markets, and verifiable computation could address some of the biggest challenges facing modern AI. Why Ethereum’s Cryptographic Advantage In AI Development Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined a clear vision for positioning ETH as the leading platform for artificial intelligence development. According to BSCN’s recent post, Vitalik has argued on X that ETH should lead AI innovation rather than copying others by focusing on zero-knowledge (ZK) privacy payments and reputation systems. Related Reading: Vitalik Reframes Ethereum L2 Strategy as ETF Inflows Return and Mainnet Scaling Accelerates In response to comments from ETH’s AI leadership post, Vitalik urged developers to consider building a fundamentally better solution rather than merely rebranding existing concepts. Vitalik emphasized that developers should do something fundamentally better by combining technology improvement in ZK, a privacy-preserving payments system, and on-chain reputation. If executed correctly, this approach could position ETH as the default platform for next-generation AI development with meaningful technology improvements. Ethereum has taken a major step toward building the foundation for autonomous AI systems, with 13,000 AI agents registered on the network in a single day, followed by the launch of ERC-8004, which went live on mainnet. Crypto analyst Teng Yan noted that the new standard allows AI agents to establish portable on-chain identities and build verifiable trust layers. However, the surge was mostly coordinated bulk onboarding, and most of the newly registered AI agents have claimed identities but are not yet active, which is normal for early infrastructure development. The real signal will emerge as reputation updates that are climbing. Recursion As Both A Scaling Tool And A Security Risk The Ethereum Foundation is releasing detailed requirements for the zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) architecture whitepaper, a document to be delivered in three milestones. The Founder of ABDK Consulting, Dmitry Khovratovich, emphasized that modern zkVMs are not monolithic circuits. Instead, they consist of multiple interconnected components, including segmentation, buses, memory structures, and recursion. Related Reading: SEAL and Ethereum Foundation Partner to Combat Wallet Drainers: Security-First Investors Switch to $BMIC Each component may be secure on its own, but the overall reliability of this system-level security depends on how they interact and function together. As a result, the whitepaper will address both architectural details and the broader security arguments supporting the recursive proof structure. The Ethereum Foundation expects the final version of the documentation to be completed by December 2026 alongside the release of zkVM proofs, which are projected to be approximately 300 kilobytes (KB) in size while maintaining a 128-bit provable security level.

    "title": "Ethereum Endures Historic Liquidation Week: Largest Sustained Liquidation Phase Since 2021",
    "body": "Ethereum continues to trade below the critical $2,000 level, reflecting persistent market pressure as traders await a clearer directional catalyst. The inability to reclaim this psychological threshold has kept sentiment cautious, with volatility elevated and liquidity conditions still uncertain. While price action has stabilized somewhat after recent declines, the broader structure suggests the market is preparing for a decisive move that could define Ethereum’s short-term trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Losses Hit Luna Crash Levels — But Price Context Points To A Different Market Phase A recent CryptoQuant report provides important context, indicating that the Ethereum market has undergone one of its most prolonged periods of stress since mid-2021. According to the data, the 7-day simple moving average of long liquidations on Binance climbed to roughly 9,000 ETH on February 6, 2026. Because this figure represents a smoothed weekly average rather than a single-day spike, it signals sustained pressure rather than a brief liquidation cascade. This pattern implies that leveraged long positions have been unwound gradually over several days. Pointing to persistent deleveraging rather than a sudden capitulation event. Historically, extended liquidation phases can reset market leverage and reduce speculative excess, though they also tend to coincide with fragile sentiment. Whether this process ultimately stabilizes Ethereum or leads to further downside remains dependent on liquidity conditions and broader market demand. Sustained Liquidations Signal Derivatives Market Reset The CryptoQuant report further notes that Ethereum’s decline from the $3,000 region to the $2,000 range did not trigger any capitulation events. Instead, the market experienced a prolonged sequence of margin calls, with leveraged long positions gradually unwound over several consecutive days. This pattern reflects persistent stress in the derivatives market rather than a short-lived liquidation cascade. Indicating that traders faced sustained pressure as the price trended lower. From a historical standpoint, the intensity and duration of this liquidation phase appear to exceed those recorded during major capitulation periods of the 2022 bear market. Such extended liquidation activity typically signals a broad deleveraging cycle, where excessive speculative positioning is systematically cleared. This process often reshapes market structure by reducing leverage-driven volatility and restoring a more balanced risk environment. The implication is that Ethereum may have already undergone a significant leverage reset in recent weeks. Persistently elevated liquidation averages can sometimes precede seller exhaustion. Weaker market participants exit positions, and forced selling pressure gradually subsides. The durability of any recovery will likely depend on renewed spot demand and macro liquidity conditions. Also, investor confidence must return following this extended period of derivatives-driven stress.

The recent breakdown places ETH below major trend-defining moving averages, suggesting weakening bullish momentum and a shift toward a more defensive market environment. Price action reflects a clear rejection from the $3,000 region earlier in the cycle. Followed by a sequence of lower highs that typically characterizes transitional or corrective phases. The latest decline also coincides with rising trading volume, often associated with distribution or leveraged position unwinding rather than organic accumulation. This dynamic reinforces the perception of ongoing market stress rather than stabilization.

Holding above this range would help preserve the broader long-term bullish framework, even amid current weakness. A sustained break below it, however, could shift sentiment toward a deeper corrective cycle. Ethereum remains sensitive to macro liquidity conditions, derivatives positioning, and overall crypto market sentiment, with recovery dependent on renewed spot demand and stabilization above key technical levels.

    "title": "Bitcoin BCMI Drops Toward Bear Market Territory: How Close Is BTC To A Real Buy Zone?",
    "body": "Bitcoin is once again facing notable selling pressure. The market confronts a challenging phase marked by weakening momentum and cautious investor positioning. Recent price action suggests that bullish conviction has softened. Traders are increasingly attentive to liquidity conditions, macro uncertainty, and shifting market sentiment. While volatility is not unusual at this stage of the cycle, the current environment reflects a market searching for direction rather than sustaining a clear upward trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Losses Hit Luna Crash Levels — But Price Context Points To A Different Market Phase A recent CryptoQuant report provides additional context through Bitcoin’s Combined Market Index (BCMI), a composite metric that integrates valuation, profitability, spending behavior, and sentiment indicators. According to the analysis, BCMI has fallen into the low 0.2 range, a level historically associated more with early bear market phases — such as those seen in 2018 and 2022 — rather than routine mid-cycle corrections. This shift suggests a deeper structural adjustment may be underway. Notably, BCMI was hovering near 0.5 as recently as October, a zone typically interpreted as market equilibrium between bullish and bearish forces. The subsequent decline indicates that this balance has broken down. Whether this signals the start of a prolonged bearish phase or a temporary reset will likely depend on future liquidity conditions, investor demand, and broader macroeconomic developments. BCMI Breakdown Points To Structural Weakness In Bitcoin Market The CryptoQuant report highlights a notable deterioration in Bitcoin’s Combined Market Index (BCMI), suggesting a shift away from mid-cycle consolidation toward a more defensive market regime. According to the analysis, the mid-cycle equilibrium around the 0.5 level failed to hold, with no meaningful rebound emerging from the 0.3 zone. Instead, the index continued declining directly toward the low 0.2 range without the type of expansion reset typically seen during healthier corrective phases. This pattern differs from past mid-cycle cooling periods and increasingly resembles a transition into a risk-off market environment. Historical comparisons provide additional perspective. Previous cycle bottoms generally formed when BCMI reached approximately 0.10–0.15, notably during 2019 and again in the 2022–2023 bear phase. Current readings remain above those capitulation levels, implying that while Bitcoin may already be operating within a bearish structural framework, full capitulation conditions have not yet materialized. Because BCMI aggregates valuation metrics such as MVRV, profitability indicators like NUPL, spending behavior via SOPR, and broader sentiment measures, its decline into the low 0.2 range reflects shrinking unrealized profits, rising realized losses, deteriorating sentiment, and ongoing valuation compression. Unless the index stabilizes and reclaims the 0.4–0.5 zone, the probability of continued structural weakness remains elevated. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drop Wipes Billions From Recent Buyers: New Whale Cost Basis Falls Toward $90K Bitcoin Tests Long-Term Support After Weekly Breakdown Bitcoin’s weekly chart reflects increasing structural pressure following the recent loss of the $70,000 level, a key psychological and technical threshold that had previously acted as support. Price has now retreated toward the mid-$60,000 range, placing BTC below shorter-term trend averages and signaling weakening bullish momentum. This shift suggests the market is transitioning from consolidation toward a more defensive phase. The chart shows a clear sequence of lower highs since the late-cycle peak near the $120,000 region. A pattern often associated with corrective or transitional market environments. Recent declines have been accompanied by elevated trading volume. Typically indicative of distribution or forced deleveraging rather than gradual profit-taking. Such dynamics often increase volatility while complicating sustained recovery attempts. Related Reading: Long-Term Ethereum Holders Expand Positions While Market Faces Pressure: Rare Signal Emerges From a structural perspective, the $60,000–$62,000 zone emerges as a critical support area. This region aligns with prior consolidation phases and high-liquidity trading zones that historically attracted demand. Holding above this level could allow Bitcoin to stabilize and potentially form a base for sideways consolidation. However, a decisive breakdown would raise the probability of deeper retracement scenarios. Bitcoin’s direction remains closely tied to liquidity conditions, institutional flows, and broader macro sentiment influencing risk assets. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "An analyst has pointed out how Shiba Inu’s break below the support line of a Parallel Channel could open the door to a target of $0.00000138. Shiba Inu Has Fallen Under Parallel Channel Support In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a technical analysis (TA) pattern that Shiba Inu has seemingly broken out of recently. The pattern in question is a “Parallel Channel,” which is a type of consolidation channel that forms whenever an asset’s price trades between two parallel trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Social Sentiment Stays Bearish Even As Price Recovers From $60,000 Drop The upper level of the pattern is likely to be a source of resistance, while the lower one that of support. If the price manages to escape either of these boundaries, then it may be likely to experience a sustained move in that direction. Parallel Channels come in a few variants. Channels that have their lines sloped upward are known as Ascending Channels, while those with trendlines pointing down are called Descending Channels. In the context of the current topic, the third and simplest type of Parallel Channels is of interest: a channel that is parallel to the time-axis. This type of Parallel Channel corresponds to a phase of true sideways movement in the asset. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the weekly price of Shiba Inu was stuck inside for the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day price of Shiba Inu retested the upper level of the Parallel Channel twice in 2024, but each time, the memecoin found rejection. During 2025, the cryptocurrency mostly consolidated near the midline of the channel, but the decline during the last quarter of the year meant that the coin plummeted toward the support line. With bearish price action continuing in 2026, the asset retested the level, but it failed to find a rebound and slipped right past it. This could be a potential sign that the memecoin is now breaking under the channel. As mentioned before, Parallel Channel breakouts can lead to sustained moves in the direction of the break. Such moves may end up being of the same length as the height of the channel. Based on this, Martinez has highlighted the $0.00000138 level, noting that the breakout could have opened the door to it. From the current SHIB price, this level is situated around 77% lower.

    "title": "Standard Chartered Lowers Bitcoin Forecast: Predicts Price Dive To $50,000 Before Rebound",
    "body": "Standard Chartered lowered its long-term outlook for Bitcoin (BTC) for the second time in less than three months as the cryptocurrency market appears to have entered a new bearish cycle. With the leading cryptocurrency currently consolidating below the key $70,000 level, the bank now warns that the asset could fall as low as $50,000 before staging a recovery. Standard Chartered Cuts Bitcoin Target to $100,000 In a note published Thursday, Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets research, said the bank now expects Bitcoin to reach $100,000 by the end of 2026. The latest figure marks a significant reduction from its previous $150,000 projection for BTC. The revision follows an earlier downgrade in December, when the bank cut its target from an ambitious $300,000. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Already Pricing A US Recession? Analyst Sees Major Risk‑Reward Setup According to Bloomberg’s report on the matter, the bank’s more cautious stance reflects a combination of weakening macroeconomic conditions and shifting investor behavior, especially over the past month’s downtrend. The leading cryptocurrency has declined more than 40% from its October peak toward current trading prices of around $67,160, while the US spot Bitcoin exchange‑traded funds (ETFs) sector has seen nearly $8 billion in net outflows. Kendrick noted that slowing US economic momentum and reduced expectations for Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts have weighed heavily on digital assets. In particular, declining ETF holdings have removed what had been a critical source of demand during previous rallies. The interest‑rate environment remains a central concern. Markets have pushed back expectations for Federal Reserve easing, with investors now anticipating that the first rate cut may come later in the year than previously thought. Kendrick also pointed to uncertainty surrounding future Federal Reserve leadership as an additional factor contributing to Bitcoin caution. The bank warned that deteriorating macro conditions and the risk of further investor capitulation could continue to pressure prices in the near term. Ethereum Could Drop To $1,400 Despite the more conservative Bitcoin forecasts, Standard Chartered emphasized that the current downturn appears more orderly than previous crypto market collapses. Kendrick highlighted that on‑chain activity data continues to show improvement, suggesting that underlying network usage remains healthy.

The bank also revised its outlook for Ethereum (ETH). Its 2026 price target for the second‑largest cryptocurrency was reduced to $4,000 from $7,500. Before reaching that level, analysts expect Ether could fall to around $1,400. Featured image from OpenArt, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Hedera (HBAR) has traded around the $0.09 mark, testing a key technical support level, even as broader price momentum remains subdued. Despite occasional short-term bounces and technical patterns suggesting relief rallies, ongoing declines in network revenue and ecosystem metrics are weighing on investor confidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Already Be Entering Crypto Winter, Researchers Warn According to live market data, HBAR is trading near $0.094, with a market capitalization of $3.9 billion and a 24-hour trading volume that reflects modest activity at current price levels. HBAR's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: HBARUSD on Tradingview Support Holds, but Trend Weakness Persists Over recent weeks, HBAR’s price action has been largely corrective, with the token moving in a range near its October lows. Analysts tracking the charts note that while the $0.088–$0.09 zone continues to act as support, the broader trend remains bearish as long as HBAR trades below key resistance levels at $0.126-$0.177. Some market participants have flagged a potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern forming on shorter-term timeframes, implying a breakout above roughly $0.094–$0.096 could open the door to moves toward $0.12. However, this scenario requires clear confirmation amid limited buying momentum. Technical indicators, such as the relative strength index (RSI), are near oversold levels, but momentum oscillators, such as MACD, remain skewed to the downside. Traders note that until HBAR regains and sustains a move above its 20-day, 50-day, and longer-term moving averages, the structural bias will likely remain negative. Ecosystem Metrics and Revenue Trends Could Influence Hedera’s (HBAR) Price Action Beyond price charts, on-chain ecosystem data suggests cooling activity. Total value locked (TVL) in Hedera’s decentralized finance layer has dropped significantly from mid-2025 highs, and weekly decentralized application revenue has declined sharply over recent weeks. Institutional interest in HBAR-linked products, such as spot exchange-traded funds, has shown limited recent inflows, in contrast to stronger demand seen in other altcoin ETFs. A lack of fresh capital from larger participants could further temper price advances if broader market uncertainty persists. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Now In The ‘Maximum Opportunity / Minimum Risk’ Zone: Crypto Analyst Analysts now see a near-term range-bound outlook for HBAR, with downside risk toward support levels around the low $0.08s if selling pressure intensifies.

    "body": "Some key on-chain indicators are flashing a red signal for Bitcoin, suggesting bearish market conditions for the number one cryptocurrency. Major On-Chain Indicators Are In Red Zone For Bitcoin In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Darkfrost has talked about what on-chain indicators are suggesting for the current Bitcoin market. The analyst has shared a heatmap that shows the signals 10 metrics related to the cryptocurrency are flashing right now. The indicators in the graph are all key on-chain metrics covering different dimensions of the network. For example, the MVRV Z-Score deals with general investor profitability, while the Trader Realized Price and Trader On-chain Profit Margin specifically track the profit-loss status of the short-term holders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Social Sentiment Stays Bearish Even As Price Recovers From $60,000 Drop All the indicators in the heatmap are currently giving a red signal, implying conditions aren’t favorable for a bull market. “As long as that remains the case, it is hard to imagine BTC reaching new highs in the short term,” noted Darkfrost. Red has spread on the heatmap as the cryptocurrency’s price has gone through its bearish price action. A couple of metrics, however, have been bearish since even before the market downturn. The indicators in question are the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse and CryptoQuant Network Activity Index. The former of these tracks the flows occurring between spot and derivatives exchanges. This metric being bearish means that there is a lack of speculative push in the market. From the chart, it’s visible that the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse went red during the drawdown phase from the first half of 2025 and has remained so since then. The CryptoQuant Network Activity Index, gauging the transaction activity occurring on the Bitcoin blockchain, left the bull territory in late 2024. Activity on the network has since mostly maintained at bearish levels, except for a few brief flashes. Most of the other metrics didn’t turn red until the November 2025 price decline. The last metric to go red was the Trader On-Chain Profit Margin, which was green during the January recovery rally, but gave the bear signal after the most recent price plunge. In some other news, the Bitcoin short-term holders have shown signs of loss-taking recently, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has highlighted in an X post. The short-term holder cohort includes the BTC investors who purchased their coins during the past 155 days. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Selloff Continues As Supply Share Drops Under 75% As the below chart shows, these holders have ramped up their loss deposits to exchanges recently. Investors usually transfer their tokens to centralized exchanges when they want to participate in selling, so these loss deposits can be a sign that some short-term holders are capitulating.

    "body": "As most of the crypto market retests crucial levels, Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to reclaim a major horizontal area. Some market observers have warned that cryptocurrency could fall to new lows if the price doesn’t bounce soon. Related Reading: LayerZero (ZRO) Soars 40% Amid Zero Blockchain Debut, Major Institutional Backing Ethereum Weekly Close On Sight On Thursday, Ethereum dropped 1.4% to retest a key area for the second consecutive day. After hitting a 10-month low of $1,747, the King of Altcoins bounced more than 15% to trade between $2,000 and $2,150 over the past few days. However, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap failed to hold the crucial $2,000 horizontal barrier on Wednesday and tested the $1,900 mark for the first time in a week. After attempting to reclaim the key psychological level in the early hours of Thursday, Ethereum was rejected toward the recent lows, briefly falling below it. Analyst Ted Pillows highlighted the importance of ETH’s current zone, as it has previously triggered major moves. To him, if the altcoin fails to reclaim the $2,000 area in the coming days, a full retrace toward the recent lows should be expected soon. Similarly, market observer Crypto Busy noted that the cryptocurrency is currently trading above a major long-term support. According to the post, the recent correction has sent Ethereum toward a three-year rising support line, which “will decide the next big move.” The analyst warned that “If the trendline breaks with strong weekly closes below $1,900, the structure weakens.” Therefore, ETH must hold its current levels in the coming days to avoid a weekly close below this level. Otherwise, its price could drop “into the next liquidity pockets around $1,600 and possibly $1,300, where the next historical support zones exist.” Is ETH’s ‘Real’ Bull Market Two Years Away? Trader AlejandroXBT shared a potential macro-outlook for Ethereum that suggests the cryptocurrency could still see another major shakeout: My thesis is that the major bullish move that began around 2019–2020 has transitioned into a large and prolonged macro correction, and that Ethereum has been consolidating within this broader corrective structure ever since. He outlined four phases for the macro structure: the pump, the correction, the shakeout, and the moon. The initial phase, which occurred between 2019 and 2021, marked “the true impulsive bullish move,” with strong trend expansion and increasing momentum. According to the market observer, the strong rally that followed the 2022 bear market appears to be a “counter-trend move within a broader corrective range” rather than a renewed bull market and the start of a new long-term cycle. As he explained, ETH’s range-bound behavior signals distribution and consolidation instead of continuation. “From this perspective, the apparent bull market that developed within the correction can be interpreted as a dead cat bounce, a technically strong bounce occurring inside a larger corrective structure,” he affirmed. Related Reading: XRP Positioned For Major Structure Shift As Price Tests Critical Level Therefore, the current macro structure would suggest that a final shakeout phase could “still be required to fully reset sentiment and liquidity before Ethereum can transition into a new impulsive bullish cycle.” Based on this, the trader anticipated a final liquidity-driven move to the downside in the coming months, followed by “the moon” phase, potentially next year, when “the structure suggests the conditions for a true long-term bullish continuation, with price discovery and expansion well beyond previous highs.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "JPMorgan Keeps Bitcoin Bull Case: $266,000 Remains The Target",
    "body": "JPMorgan is sticking with its long-run bitcoin upside framework, including a $266,000 per-coin target, even as the bank flags near-term stress signals around mining economics and still-chilly risk sentiment heading into 2026. The bank’s latest read hinges on two pillars: a “soft” floor around bitcoin’s production cost, and a valuation model that maps bitcoin’s potential market cap against private-sector gold investment on a volatility-adjusted basis. In the near term, JPMorgan frames the current drawdown as a familiar stress test for miners. The bank estimates the cost to produce a bitcoin at roughly $77,000, while bitcoin was trading around the mid-$60,000s in the same analysis window, putting spot below breakeven for less efficient operators. JP Morgan Remains Bullish On Bitcoin Historically, JPMorgan argues, production cost tends to behave like “soft” support rather than a hard line. The mechanism is reflexive: if prices stay below profitability for long enough, weaker miners shut down, difficulty adjusts lower, and the average cost of production falls, effectively tightening the band that previously sat above spot. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Crash Toward $60,000 Was “Necessary” The bank also keeps its broader market tone constructive for 2026, leaning on the idea that institutional capital (not retail or corporate treasuries) is the marginal buyer that can restart flows when the macro backdrop stabilizes. As JPMorgan put it: “We are positive on the outlook for 2026 and expect increased inflows into digital assets, driven by institutional investors.” JPMorgan’s $266,000 target is not pitched as a 2026 “call,” but as the mathematical end point of a gold-parity thought experiment. In the bank’s model, matching the scale of private gold investment (roughly $8 trillion, excluding central banks) implies a bitcoin price around $266,000, a level the analysts themselves described as “unrealistic” in the near term. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Leading On-Chain Analyst Sees A Floor Forming The bridge between “unrealistic now” and “possible later,” in JPMorgan’s framing, is volatility. The bank has pointed to a bitcoin-to-gold volatility ratio around 1.5, unusually low by historical standards and argues that gold’s surge since October alongside rising gold volatility has improved bitcoin’s relative appeal over the long run. “The large outperformance of gold vs. bitcoin since last October coupled with the sharp rise in gold volatility has led to bitcoin looking even more attractive compared to gold over the long term,” the analysts wrote. JPMorgan’s stance effectively splits the tape into two timeframes: a messy adjustment process if bitcoin remains below mining breakevens, and a longer-duration bet that institutional inflows and regulatory progress in the US can reprice the asset’s role versus gold as 2026 unfolds. At press time, BTC traded at $66,229. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",
