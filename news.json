    "title": "Bitcoin Climbs Past $92K While Trump Signals Colombia Action",
    "body": "Bitcoin climbed past the $92,000 mark on Monday, driven by a mix of strong buying and fresh geopolitical noise. Traders watched as BTC moved toward $93,000 after brief gains in global markets, hitting roughly $92,800 in early US trading. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s 16% Pop Signals Meme Coin Revival – Details Geopolitical Jitters And Market Moves According to market reports, comments from US President Donald Trump about potential action in Colombia added to market uncertainty, helping send flows into risk assets like Bitcoin. Traders sold some positions and then bought back into BTC as prices steadied near the highs. ETF inflows were also cited as supporting demand, with one report noting about $645 million in net flows into Bitcoin spot ETFs around the same session. Bitcoin’s climb was modest in percentage terms, but the dollar amounts grabbed attention. Data showed BTC trading in the low $92,000s before attempts to push higher toward $93,000. Reports have also pointed to liquidations and futures activity that rearranged short positions, prompting quick moves in both directions. PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST NOW: Trump: “Colombia is run by a sick man, he’s not going to be doing it for very long.” Reporter: “So there will be an operation by the US in Colombia?” Trump: “Sounds good to me.” pic.twitter.com/66fQM7cEIY — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) January 5, 2026 Colombia On Trump’s Crosshairs Based on reports, the recent US operation in Venezuela and wider tensions in Latin America had a role in shifting sentiment. Speaking on Sunday, Trump took aim at Colombia over cocaine trafficking, saying a fresh US military operation tied to the country “sounds good to me,” according to Reuters. He also warned that action may be needed in Mexico. Trump described Colombia as “very sick” and accused its leader of fueling the cocaine trade into the United States, saying that situation “won’t last very long.” Total crypto market valuation at $3.12 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView Institutional Flows And Market Structure Meanwhile, spot ETF purchases and macro traders were active during the move higher. The inflows cited in market pieces suggest institutions continued to add exposure, even as headline risk rose. At the same time, derivatives desks reported notable liquidations that briefly amplified volatility. Some analysts told outlets they see technical hurdles near the current range that could cap gains without fresh catalysts. Others said the next key levels to watch are the area around $93,000 and the lows near the $88,000s to $90,000s, where stop orders and margin calls could trigger sharper swings. Related Reading: $18 Million Ethereum Loss Sends Whale Running To Gold Mixed Signals Market signals remain mixed. While ETF inflows point to steady interest from larger pools of capital, geopolitical headlines from the region keep a risk premium live in prices. Traders are watching US economic data this week as well, since work on jobs and inflation prints could alter the tone for both stocks and crypto. Bitcoin’s push above $92,000 came at a moment of heightened news flow — where comments from US President Donald Trump and big institutional buying intersected. Prices moved quickly, numbers mattered, and traders now watch whether demand can hold near current levels or if headline risk will force a pullback.

    "title": "Bitcoin Wealth Isn’t About Hype—It’s About Time And Stacking, Expert Says",
    "body": "According to an exchange on X, a user asked when Bitcoin would “boom.” A crypto expert answered bluntly that relying on a single price explosion to get rich is the wrong plan and summed up his approach as “time plus stacking.” The remark cut through the guessing and put the focus back on steady habits, not wild hopes. Related Reading: A Maduro Bet, A Market Alarm: US Lawmaker Targets Trading Abuses Bitcoin As A Store Of Value Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, with a hard cap of 21 million coins. That matters because, as Jeremie and other long-term holders point out, Bitcoin is best used to hold value you earned elsewhere. Stacking, in practice, means buying small amounts regularly. Time means keeping those holdings for years. Both together reduce the pressure to guess tops and bottoms and make the plan mechanical rather than emotional. Many buyers still chase quick gains. They ask when the next big run will hit. The answer from long-term traders is simple: hope is not a plan. Fiat money often loses buying power over time, while Bitcoin’s limited supply is designed to preserve value for those who hold through cycles. If you’re relying on #Bitcoin to “boom” to make you rich, you’re doing it wrong. Bitcoin is for storing what you earn. The win is time plus stacking. https://t.co/PDdrf3G6nv — Davinci Jeremie (@Davincij15) January 5, 2026 Price Movements And Political Ties Based on reports, Bitcoin hit a three-week high and traded above $93,000, rising as much as 2.54% on Monday morning. The token cleared its 50-day moving average for the first time since the market tumble that began in early October. Bitcoin is up about 6% so far this year after plunging roughly 22% in the fourth quarter. Ether also moved higher alongside Bitcoin as broader markets rallied. Political events, including the ouster of Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro by US special forces and related developments, pushed some investors toward safe-haven assets like gold and silver while not putting a clear dent in appetite for riskier bets like tech stocks. Trading activity and headline news have been linked to short-term moves in crypto prices more than once this year. How Ordinary Investors Should Act According to veteran holders, the mix of steady buying and patience beats timing the market. That is the core of Jeremie’s message. Buy small. Keep adding. Don’t watch the screen every hour. Over time, that habit smooths out the big swings and removes emotional buying at highs and panic selling at lows. Reports indicate many newcomers still treat Bitcoin like a lotto ticket. That mindset fuels big swings. When prices climb, people rush in. When they fall, sellers rush out. The strategy Jeremie described aims to flip that behavior: make accumulation routine, make holding routine.

For people who want to use Bitcoin to protect savings, the clear choice is steady accumulation plus a long holding period. For those chasing a sudden “boom,” the risk is high and the outcome uncertain — at least according to the analyst. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "Dogecoin started a major increase above $0.150 against the US Dollar. DOGE is now consolidating and might decline if it trades below $0.1450. DOGE price started a fresh increase above $0.1450 and $0.150. The price is trading above the $0.150 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.150 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could aim for a fresh increase if it remains stable above $0.1450. Dogecoin Price Consolidates Gains Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above $0.1320, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE climbed above the $0.140 resistance to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above $0.150. A high was formed at $0.1541 and the price is now correcting some gains. There was a move toward the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1156 swing low to the $0.1541 high. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.150 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.150 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. If there is another increase, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1540 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.1550 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1620 level. A close above the $0.1620 resistance might send the price toward $0.1750. Any more gains might send the price toward $0.180. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1840. Downside Break In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1550 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.150 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $0.145 level. The main support sits at $0.1420. If there is a downside break below the $0.1420 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.1350 level or even $0.1320 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.150 and $0.1450. Major Resistance Levels – $0.1540 and $0.1550.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Accumulation Continues: Strategy Purchases 1,287 BTC Amid Rising Prices",
    "body": "On Monday, Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, announced a new acquisition of Bitcoin (BTC) in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Notably, this latest purchase brings the company’s total holdings to nearly 680,000 BTC, with current figures standing at 672,497 BTC. Bitcoin Buys Vs. Stock Struggles Analysts, including Lirrato on the social media platform X, revealed that the company acquired 22,498 BTC in December alone. To reach the target of 680,000 BTC by January, Strategy needs only 7,503 more coins—an amount they surpassed last month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches $93,000 Amid Renewed Optimism: What To Keep An Eye On This Week However, despite this bullish acquisition, the company’s stock (MSTR) has experienced a significant decline, plummeting by over 50% throughout 2025 to its current trading price of around $163 on Monday. Adding to the challenges facing Strategy, the firm could be just ten days away from being delisted from the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) index, awaiting for the formal announcement. In an October proposal, MSCI indicated that firms holding digital assets amounting to 50% or more of their total assets should be removed from its global benchmarks. This move was justified by MSCI’s assertion that these firms resemble investment funds, which are excluded from its indexes. Strategy Braces For Potential Financial Turmoil Presently, MSCI is conducting a public consultation, and if it determines that Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies like Strategy should be excluded, it could set a precedent that other index providers might follow. In a public letter, Strategy’s CEO, Phong Le, and co-founder Michael Saylor discussed the possible implications of an MSCI exclusion. They estimated that such a decision could lead to around $2.8 billion worth of the company’s stock being liquidated, creating a potential chilling effect across the entire industry. Analysts from TD Cowen highlighted that approximately $2.5 billion of Strategy’s market value is tied to MSCI, while an additional $5.5 billion hinges on other indexes. JPMorgan’s analysis suggests that if MSCI were to exclude Strategy, the company could face $2.8 billion in outflows, a number that could escalate to $8.8 billion if it were delisted from additional indexes, including the Nasdaq 100, the CRSP US Total Market Index, and various Russell indexes owned by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). Related Reading: Consumer Crypto Spending Grows in 2026 as Visa Reports Major Card Growth Alongside these potential challenges, Strategy may soon have to contend with substantial financial losses that starkly contrast the $2.8 billion profit they reported in the previous year’s third quarter. Additionally, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index indicates that Michael Saylor has seen his personal wealth diminish dramatically during this downturn, dropping approximately 40% to about $3.8 billion. Nevertheless, on Monday, cryptocurrency prices saw a notable recovery, with Bitcoin and other digital assets such as Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL) and XRP climbing back above key levels, sparking a new wave of optimism among investors.

    "body": "While Ethereum (ETH) attempts to turn a crucial level into support, some analysts have shared a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency, which could send its price above the $4,000 barrier in the first quarter of 2026. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On The Brink Of A 9,000% Rally To $10? What Historical Performance Shows End-Of-Year Weakness To Ignite Q1 Rally On Monday, Ethereum broke above the $3,200 barrier for the first time in nearly a month, hitting a four-week high of $3,259. The cryptocurrency has seen a 8.3% surge from the crucial $3,000 level since Friday, consolidating above the $3,100 level over the weekend. Now, the King of Altcoins is trying to hold the key resistance level and turn it into support. Amid this performance, some market observers shared a potential setup that could lead to a significant rally during the next three months. In an X post, analyst Niels affirmed that Ethereum’s quarterly close in the red is “not as bearish as it looks.” Notably, the altcoin recorded its worst Q4 in six years after closing the quarter with a negative return of 28.28%, according to CoinGlass data. This marks ETH’s first negative Q4 close since 2022, and its worst end-of-year performance since 2019, when it registered a negative return of 28.9%. Nonetheless, Niels highlighted that this opens the door for an “interesting” setup ahead of the altcoin’s expected seasonality. “History tells an interesting story: every single time ETH has finished Q4 in the red, the next Q1 has closed green,” the analyst explained, asserting that “year-end weakness has usually acted as a reset, not a reversal.” Per the post, the end-of-year leverage flush and sentiment cooling have previously enabled Ethereum to start the new year “from a cleaner base,” which has allowed the altcoin to register quarterly returns of up to 52% in recent years. “If that pattern holds, Q4 wasn’t the warning; it was the setup heading into Q1,” he suggested. Ethereum Prepares For 30% Breakout As the price records an 11% weekly surge, analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that the cryptocurrency is about to face an important zone that has served as resistance for nearly two months. Since the early November pullback, the largest altcoin by market capitalization has been trading between the $2,700-$3,400 price range, experiencing strong resistance around the $3,000 and $3,200 levels. Now that the mid-zone of the range has been momentarily reclaimed, ETH must hold its momentum and turn the upper boundary into support. “A reclaim of this level will pump Ethereum towards the $3,800-$4,000 level,” where the next major resistance is located, Ted explained on Monday morning. On the contrary, a rejection from this resistance zone could send the ETH price toward the $3,000 support, while risking a longer consolidation within its two-month range.

According to the analyst, Ethereum has been compressing between the pattern’s ascending and descending trendlines since November, awaiting a 30% move. If the price holds its current breakout from the upper boundary, the cryptocurrency could see a rally toward the $4,000 area in the coming weeks, positioning ETH for a retest of the Q3 levels. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,253, a 3.4% increase in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Surges Towards $2.20: Leading Monday Gains And Driving Crypto ETF Inflows",
    "body": "In 2025, XRP emerged as the best-performing token among the top ten largest cryptocurrencies, outpacing gains from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). As the first week of 2026 unfolds, XRP has continued this upward trend, recording a 17% surge over the past week that has propelled its price back above the key $2.20 threshold. Strong ETF Demand Pushes XRP Forward One of the prominent factors contributing to this surge is the strong performance of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which became a standout in the market by attracting $483 million over the past weeks. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs experienced a significant outflow of $1.09 billion, while Ethereum products faced a loss of $564 million. XRP funds not only achieved $483 million in inflows during December but also maintained a steady influx for 30 consecutive trading days. This streak finally ended on December 26 with the first day of zero inflows. Overall, since their launch in November, total inflows into XRP exchange-traded funds have amassed to $1.3 billion, marking the fastest adoption rate for any altcoin ETF to date. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches $93,000 Amid Renewed Optimism: What To Keep An Eye On This Week Looking ahead, reports suggest that the ETF landscape could be pivotal in shaping bullish scenarios for XRP. A potential filing by BlackRock for an XRP ETF could serve as a significant credibility boost, attracting conservative institutional investors to the space. BlackRock’s own $40 billion Bitcoin ETF exemplifies the capacity to mobilize capital effectively through its Aladdin platform connections. Additionally, the scaling of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin into banking and remittance services could generate ongoing demand for XRP as a critical bridge asset. There are also signs that the Federal Reserve could implement several rate cuts in 2026, which would lower the opportunity cost of investing in risk assets. Under such conditions, it is alleged that the XRP price might break through its all-time high of $3.84, potentially escalating toward the $4.00 to $5.00 range by year-end. On The Cusp Of Major Gains? When it comes to price action, market analyst Dark Defender, active on the social media platform X (previously Twitter), recently highlighted XRP’s price action by providing a three-month time frame update. The analyst noted that a newly initiated green candle in January exhibits a bullish Relative Strength Index (RSI). According to Dark Defender, surpassing the $2.22 level is crucial for XRP. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On The Brink Of A 9,000% Rally To $10? What Historical Performance Shows He further suggested that XRP could be on the brink of a significant surge, similar to silver, and pointed to ambitious targets such as $6 and even as high as $20 in the future. Achieving $6 would represent a notable 171% increase from current trading prices, while reaching the $20 mark would indicate a staggering 800% rise. While trading at $2.21 at the time of writing, the token is still facing $2.22 as the next major short-term resistance level, and is also trading at 40% below its all-time high.

    "title": "Bitcoin Miner Capitulation Ends: Hash Ribbons Flash Buy Signal",
    "body": "On-chain data suggests Bitcoin miner capitulation may have ended as the Hash Ribbons indicator has printed a fresh buy signal. Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Have Seen A Bullish Crossover As highlighted by Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards in a new X post, the Hash Ribbons has just given a signal for Bitcoin. The “Hash Ribbons” here refers to a metric created by Edwards that basically provides a representation of the miners’ situation. Related Reading: PEPE Explodes 62%, But Analyst Warns Of Breakdown Retest It does so by comparing two moving averages (MAs) of the “Hashrate,” an indicator that measures the total amount of computing power that the miners have connected to the network. When the value of this metric rises, it suggests existing miners are expanding their facilities and/or new ones are joining the blockchain. Such a trend implies these validators may be finding BTC mining to be an attractive venture. On the other hand, the indicator going down suggests some of the miners have decided to disconnect from the network, potentially because they are no longer able to break even on mining activities. The Hash Ribbons aims to pinpoint when one of these behaviors becomes dominant. The 30-day and 60-day MAs of the Hashrate play the role of the “ribbons” and their crossovers provide signals for shifts in miners’ condition. The 30-day MA moving below the 60-day one is considered to signal the start of a “miner capitulation.” In this phase, miners are under pressure and BTC may arrive at a bottom. The reverse crossover implies the return of conviction among miners, which has often been followed by bullish price action. Below is the chart for the Hash Ribbons shared by the analyst that shows the signals that Bitcoin has witnessed over the last few years. As is visible in the graph, the 30-day MA of the Bitcoin Hashrate fell below the 60-day ribbon last year as miners reduced their computing power in response to the bearish price action in the cryptocurrency. After a period of staying in the capitulation region, the reverse crossover has now finally occurred, meaning that the situation of the miners is improving, at least from the perspective of the Hash Ribbons. From the chart, it’s visible that this kind of “buy signal” occurred at some key points in the last few years. The recovery from 2022 bear market in 2023, for example, took place after a bullish crossover in the Hash Ribbons. The mini-bear phase in mid-2021 also broke with a buy signal from the indicator.

    "title": "John Bollinger: Bitcoin BB Squeeze Breakout Targets $107,000",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s daily chart is flashing what John Bollinger calls “a little classic technical analysis”: a well-formed base followed by a Bollinger Band Squeeze and an upside breakout that puts $100,000 and roughly $107,000 in view, so long as price can hold the move and avoid slipping back into the prior range. Bitcoin Rebound To $107,000 Next? “Near perfect base for BTCUSD with a Bollinger Band Squeeze and breakout,” Bollinger wrote alongside the chart. “First upside target 100,000, second ~107,000, third ??? If we fail here it is back into the trenches.” On the daily timeframe, BTC spent much of the late-year period carving out a sideways-to-slightly-higher base after the sharp Q4 selloff. The chart explicitly labels that “Base” region, with price repeatedly holding a low-to-mid $80,000s floor area before turning higher. That basing process matters in Bollinger’s framing because it provided the platform for volatility compression to do its work. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Recovery Extends Into 2026 as Charts Hint at Another Leg Higher The squeeze is visible in the Bollinger BandWidth panel at the bottom of the chart, where BandWidth sinks to a marked low (“Squeeze”) and then begins to turn up. That inflection is paired with a sharp surge in the %B panel (the middle indicator pane), where %B drives up through the 1.0 line, an on-chart signal that price has pushed beyond the upper Bollinger Band. Bollinger annotates that moment as the “Breakout,” and the price panel shows the market accelerating higher off the base as the bands begin to open. On Bollinger’s chart, BTC is trading at $94,484, with the upper band curling higher and the mid-band rising beneath price. In plain terms: the move is no longer just compression; it is active expansion. Bollinger’s chart draws two horizontal red targets above current price: the first at $100,000 and the second near $107,000. Related Reading: The Real Reason Bitcoin Is Stuck: Futures Trading Dwarfs ETFs 20-To-1 The risk control is equally clear in his commentary. “If we fail here it is back into the trenches,” he wrote, language that, in chart terms, points to BTC losing the breakout and slipping back into the prior base region which is capped at the $93,500 region. This price level is of utmost importance for Bollinger. What About ETH And XRP? Bollinger also addressed the broader crypto market:“Someone asked about ETHUSD. Same pattern, a bit delayed, following not leading,” he wrote, positioning ether as a lagging participant rather than the driver. For XRP, Bollinger’s take was more cautious despite the obvious lift. “And ripple, strong lift, but the pattern is weaker. BTC > ETH > XRP for now.” At press time, BTC traded at $93,325.

    "title": "Here’s Why The Shiba Inu Price Jumped Over 13%",
    "body": "The Shiba Inu price has recorded an unexpected gain of more than 13% recently, decisively breaking away from the extended bear trend that had suppressed its momentum. Notably, 2026 is already shaping up to be a transformative year for the crypto market, with meme coins like Shiba Inu benefiting from the broader bullish shift and growing demand. With the Shiba Inu price now testing higher valuation zones, on-chain data has revealed the underlying forces behind its recent price surge Key Drivers Behind The Shiba Inu Price Rally Shiba Inu surged more than 13% on Sunday, January 4, as the broader 2026 meme coin frenzy began unexpectedly and continued to rotate capital among speculative assets. According to data from Santiment, a crypto analytics platform, SHIB’s sudden upside move was largely driven by aggressive accumulation from top whales rather than a surge in retail demand. Related Reading: Here Are The Top Meme Coins Leading The Crypto Recovery Ahead Of Dogecoin And Shiba Inu In a post on X, Santiment analysts noted that large holders were tightening their grip on Shiba Inu’s supply amid muted retail distribution. This behaviour points to growing confidence among dominant whale wallets and suggests that the recent price rally was not fueled by short-term, hype-driven buying. Price data also shows the Shiba Inu climb began at the start of January this year, after spending several weeks consolidating near recent lows. Notably, the recent bounce followed a prolonged downtrend that spanned late October through December 2025, making the 13% price jump stand out as a clear shift in momentum. Overlaying the price action is a rising line on Santiment’s chart that tracks the percentage of SHIB supply held by the top 10 whale wallets. While prices fluctuated throughout the second half of 2025, this metric steadily increased, signaling consistent accumulation even as broader market conditions remained weak. At the time of the analysis, the 10 largest Shiba Inu wallets collectively controlled about 62.65% of the total supply. Such a high level of concentration is unusual and gives large token holders significant influence over short-term price movements. The single largest wallet alone held roughly 41% of the total SHIB supply, valued at approximately $3.3 billion. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Lead Dev Reacts To Wild Development On Coinbase Involving $35 Million In SHIB Meanwhile, other top whale wallets each controlled between 2.8% and 5.7%, with several individual addresses worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the timing of Shiba Inu’s 13% price jump aligns with a visible uptick in whale concentration at the far right of the chart. As more supply became locked up, available liquidity thinned, allowing relatively modest buying pressure to push prices significantly higher. Shiba Inu’s Total Gains In 2026 So Far According to Santiment, Shiba Inu’s performance in 2026 now stands at a gain of more than 32% Year-to-Date (YTD). If wallet concentration remains elevated and whales continue to grow wealthier, volatility is likely to persist as prices respond quickly to shifts in large-holder behavior. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00000916, reflecting a roughly 5% increase in just one day. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Only 1 Week Left As XRP RSI Breakout Sets Up $10 Path, Analyst Predicts",
    "body": "XRP is compressing on the weekly chart into a clearly defined post-breakout range, and analyst Maelius (@MaeliusCrypto)argues the next directional clue will come from the RSI, with a breakout “sometime in Q1” that he expects to coincide with higher prices and a push toward $10. Maelius’ chart is a 1W XRP/USD view (Bitstamp) with a 50-week EMA overlaid. The market’s most recent regime shift is clear: a sharp vertical expansion carried XRP from a long base into a higher trading band, followed by a multi-week consolidation inside a shaded range. Is XRP Set To Explode Within 1 Week? That range is anchored by two levels the chart emphasizes. The upper boundary aligns with the prior spike high near $3.33 (the 2018 peak), while the lower boundary sits just above $1.60. At the time of the screenshot, XRP is around $2.124 on the weekly close, placing price just below the 50-week EMA, the most immediate, high-visibility pivot in Maelius’ framing. The Elliott labeling casts the current chop as a corrective wave 4 after the impulsive advance. The message is less “trend is broken” and more “trend is pausing.” Maelius added that his “conservative count assumes there is only 1W left,” implying a relatively tight window for the market to resolve the consolidation and transition into wave 5 if momentum confirms. Related Reading: XRP Is Setting Up For Its ‘Next Explosive Move,’ Analysts Say: Here’s The Target The broader layout of the chart also invites a comparison to 2017: XRP’s first major run off a base, a long mid-cycle breather, and then a second, sharper leg into the ultimate high. In the comparison within the chart, XRP rallied roughly 7,400% in about three months in early 2017, consolidated from May through December, then surged again by roughly 1,500%. Today’s sequencing is presented as similar in shape, if not necessarily in magnitude: a strong first leg from roughly November 2024 through January 2025 (roughly +500%), followed by a year-long consolidation into January 2026. In that read, the next major leg higher could be approaching, potentially shallower than the first, with wave 5 serving as the “second push” analogue. Related Reading: Analyst Updates XRP Price Prediction: Why $16 Is Still On The Table The lower panel is a weekly RSI with a descending trendline capping recent peaks. That red down-sloping line is Maelius’ timing trigger: “RSI breaks out sometime in Q1. Price goes higher.” The implication is straightforward. In his framework, momentum needs to break its own compression before price can sustain the next expansion phase. Crucially, the chart also carries a higher-degree label that places the current wave 4 within a larger wave III, rather than portraying the next wave 5 as a terminal, cycle-ending move. That aligns with his response when asked whether $10 would be a quarterly “max”: “Sometime in Q1 we should get a breakout, not necessarily a top. Next wave should be towards 10$.” If the thesis is working, XRP would be expected to reclaim the 50-week EMA and reassert acceptance back toward the range highs near $3.33, with the RSI trendline break acting as the confirmation event Maelius is watching. If it fails, continued rejection at the EMA and a breakdown through the range floor above $1.60 would keep the wave-4 corrective phase in play and delay the wave-5 path he’s mapped. At press time, XRP traded at $2.37. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Bitcoin moved higher on renewed buying from large holders while smaller wallets were seen booking gains, a pattern that on-chain watchers view as supportive for further upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Wealth Isn’t About Hype—It’s About Time And Stacking, Expert Says Whale Accumulation And Retail Profit-Taking According to Santiment, wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC — described as whales and sharks — have added 56,227 BTC since mid-December. At the same time, wallets with less than 0.01 BTC have been taking profits, suggesting some retail traders expect a bull trap or a fool’s rally. This split — heavy accumulation by large holders while small accounts sell — raises the odds of market cap growth across crypto. Supply Redistribution And Market Structure Market observers say supply is shifting in a way that helps price action. Analyst James Check pointed out that the top-heavy supply share has fallen from 67% to 47%, a large move in a short span. 📊 Crypto markets typically follow the path of key whale & shark stakeholders, and move the opposite direction of small retail wallets.

Bitcoin has been mostly rangebound between roughly $87,000 and $94,000 for about six weeks, but it briefly reached a seven-week high of $94,800 on Coinbase during late trading on Monday. Options And Key Levels Traders watching option interest see heavy call activity around the $100,000 strike for January expiry. Data shows Bitcoin as being in a bullish consolidation phase, with immediate resistance seen at $95,000 to $100,000 and support placed near $88,000 to $90,000. A clean break above the upper zone could push prices higher, while a breach below the lower zone might invite deeper selling pressure. Geopolitical Shock And Trading Volume Following the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by US forces, Bitcoin moved to multi-week highs and traded above key levels near $93,000 on Monday, based on reports. Analysts tied the move partly to geopolitical uncertainty pushing some investors toward alternative assets. Speculation about Venezuela’s alleged large BTC holdings — reportedly hundreds of thousands of coins — also added to market chatter and trade activity. Overall, the event coincided with higher volatility and volume, reflecting broad market reactions to global tension rather than serving as a direct driver of Bitcoin’s fundamental value. Related Reading: A Maduro Bet, A Market Alarm: US Lawmaker Targets Trading Abuses What This Means For Traders The current mix of big-wallet buying and retail profit-taking gives the market a tilted bias. If accumulation by whales continues, the chance of an upward breakout rises. Yet the retail sell-off warns that short-term reversals remain possible. The $95,000 to $100,000 range appears to be a key area for a potential breakout, while support around $88,000 to $90,000 could influence sentiment if prices fall below it. Reports and on-chain data suggest momentum leans toward further gains, though the market may remain volatile as traders respond to both technical levels and geopolitical developments.

    "title": "Analyst Says the Worst Is Over For Dogecoin, Predicts Rally To $0.8",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Charting Guy has predicted that the worst may be over for Dogecoin, with a potential rally to $0.8 on the cards. This comes as meme coins like DOGE dominate the crypto market at the start of this new year. Dogecoin Eyes Rally To $0.8 As The Worst May Be Over In an X post, Charting Guy shared a chart showing that Dogecoin could rally to as high as $0.8, marking a new all-time high for the foremost meme coin. Based on this, he remarked that the worst may be over if the meme coin was following a chart pattern he had mapped out earlier. The analyst had earlier raised the possibility of DOGE entering a long-term consolidation, similar to XRP, and then breaking out, with a rally to as high as $1. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On The Brink Of A 9,000% Rally To $10? What Historical Performance Shows Charting Guy’s accompanying chart showed that Dogecoin could trade sideways until mid-2028 and then break out to this $0.8 target, with the possibility of even reaching the psychological $1 level. With the worst being over, the drop to $0.11 last month could mark the bottom for the meme coin, especially seeing as it has regained its bull market structure. Dogecoin has begun the year with a rally of almost of 30% as meme coins lead the current crypto market rally. Thanks to this, DOGE is the top gainer among the top 10 cryptos by market cap. The rally has also reignited institutional interest in the meme coin, with the DOGE ETFs recording significant inflows. SoSoValue data show that these funds recorded net inflows of $2.30 million on December 2 and $1.60 million yesterday, marking the first time they have seen consecutive inflows since December 3, 2025. How Things Could Play Out For DOGE In The Short Term In another X post, Charting Guy shared a chart highlighting his lower-timeframe speculation for Dogecoin. The chart showed that DOGE could sustain this rally and reach $0.2 at the start of February. Once that happens, the meme coin could experience a sharp pullback, dropping to as low as $0.12 in March, which could mark the bottom. Dogecoin will then see another impulsive move to the upside, breaking above $0.2 this time around and potentially reaching $0.22. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Rally To All-Time Highs If It Breaks This Resistance Level Crypto analyst Javon Marks provided a more bullish outlook for Dogecoin, stating that the next seemingly modest targets are $0.6533 and $1.25111. However, he added that altcoin seasons have shown that DOGE can have upside potential beyond the imagination of many people, and his accompanying chart indicated that a rally to $11 was possible. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.15, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Peakpx, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "Arthur Hayes argues that the US move to seize control of Venezuelan oil is less about geopolitics than electoral math and that the resulting policy mix of hotter nominal growth and capped energy costs is structurally bullish for Bitcoin and high-beta crypto. In a Jan. 6 essay titled “Suavemente,” the BitMEX co-founder frames the current moment through a deliberately simple lens: US politicians optimize for re-election, and the median voter optimizes for perceived economic wellbeing. “The question is, does the American colonization of Venezuela make Bitcoin/crypto number go up or down?” Hayes writes. Hayes’ core claim is that US political control is decided at the margins, and those margins respond overwhelmingly to the economy and inflation, particularly “food and energy” inflation. “Above all else… the only issue that the median voter cares about is the economy,” he writes. “It is easy to pump the economy, and by that, I mean nominal GDP. That is just a question of how much credit Trump can create.” Related Reading: Venezuela, Geopolitical Risk, And Bitcoin: What On-Chain Data Really Shows But Hayes insists the same playbook can backfire if inflation follows, especially at the pump. “The key metric for Americans is the price of gasoline,” he writes, arguing that limited public transportation makes gas prices a daily referendum on economic management. In that framework, Venezuela’s value is straightforward: suppress oil, suppress gasoline, and keep the “run the economy hot” promise intact without triggering voter backlash. He highlights what he calls a “10% rule”: “when the national average price of gasoline rises 10% or more in the three months preceding an election versus the average price in January of the same calendar year, control of one or more branches of government switches teams.” That dynamic, in his telling, creates two regimes that matter for markets: nominal GDP/credit up with oil up, or nominal GDP/credit up with oil flat-to-down. Why Bitcoin “Wins” If Oil Stays Contained Hayes’ bullish conclusion rests on the idea that oil prices constrain the durability of money printing, not the mechanics of Bitcoin itself. “Because of the energy used running computers engaged in proof of work mining, Bitcoin is the purest monetary abstraction there is,” he writes. “Therefore, the price of energy is irrelevant to the price of Bitcoin as all miners will face a parallel shift up or down in the price at the same time. The price of oil only matters regarding its ability to force politicians to stop printing money.” Related Reading: John Bollinger: Bitcoin BB Squeeze Breakout Targets $107,000 In his setup, the stress signals are macro-market ones: the 10-year Treasury yield and the MOVE Index, a measure of bond-market volatility. He argues that when oil rises far enough to push yields “close to 5%,” volatility spikes, leverage unwinds, and policymakers are pressured into a pivot. Hayes points to a prior episode as a template for reflexivity: “If you remember, Trump threatened tariffs so high… markets tanked, and the MOVE Index spiked to an intraday high of 172. The next day after the spike, Trump… ‘paused’ the tariffs, and markets bottomed then recovered violently.” Absent that stress, Hayes’ base case is aggressive credit expansion with oil “subsided if not outright fall,” which he ties directly to Bitcoin upside. He cites his “USD Liquidity Conditions Index” as evidence that Bitcoin’s trend tracks dollar liquidity, concluding: “As the amount of dollars expands, the price of Bitcoin and certain cryptos will sky rocket.” The essay also reads like a positioning memo. Hayes says his fund, Maelstrom, entered 2026 with “almost maximum risk,” low dollar-stable exposure, and an intention to rotate: “To obtain outperformance versus BTC and ETH, I will sell BTC to fund privacy positions and sell ETH to fund DeFi.” He names Zcash (ZEC) as the “privacy beta,” saying the fund is “already long a fuck ton of that” from 3Q25. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $93,841. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Pundit Warns XRP Investors To Stop Calling For $10,000, Shares ‘Realistic’ Price Targets",
    "body": "A prominent crypto commentator known as Mason Versluis has issued a notable warning for XRP investors, pointing out that parts of the discussion around XRP to lofty price targets as high as $10,000 have drifted far away from reality and risk misleading investors. Pundit Pushes Back Against $10,000 XRP Predictions Bullish price predictions around XRP have been arriving at an unusually fast pace in recent months, especially as spot exchange-traded funds and institutional participation are now a major part of investor conversations. Related Reading: The Great XRP Exodus: Here’s How Much Is Left On Crypto Exchanges Social media platforms are now filled with increasingly high targets, ranging from triple-digit valuations to extreme calls for four-figure and even five-figure prices at $10,000. Just a few years ago, you would not have believed such XRP price predictions would be as rampant as this. In a recent video clip circulating across the crypto community, Mason Versluis delivered an unusually blunt assessment of the $10,000 predictions for the altcoin. He dismissed the figure outright, noting that such price targets should not even be part of current conversations. According to Versluis, anyone aggressively promoting those numbers is doing investors a disservice and misleading them. His argument is based on the fact that XRP has yet to demonstrate the ability to break above far lower price levels, making five-digit projections detached from present conditions. A closer look at XRP’s circulating supply explains why the $10,000 prediction raises doubts. XRP currently has a circulating supply of about 66 billion tokens with a market cap of $141.9 billion. Therefore, calculations based on the current circulating supply would imply a market cap of roughly $660 trillion if the altcoin reaches $10,000, which is far greater than the current top 100 assets by market cap combined. To put this in context, gold currently has a market cap of about $31 trillion. The most realistic way that the token might reach $10,000 is for the circulating supply to decrease significantly. Bullish Bias Exists, But Built Around Progression According to Versias, XRP reaching $10,000 is not outright impossible. However, the world has only seen roughly 2% of the changes that would be required for XRP to approach a $10,000 valuation. Related Reading: Here’s How Much The XRP Price Will Be If It Overtakes Ethereum In Market Cap XRP has not even reached $10, let alone maintained it. In order for any outstanding price levels to become a reality, XRP would first need to break above double digits $10, and hold above. From here, discussions about $50, $100, or higher only become meaningful after XRP proves strength at each preceding level. Despite the criticism, Versluis made it clear that his outlook on XRP is not bearish. He acknowledged that his stance has grown increasingly optimistic due to developments such as ETF momentum, DeFi activity, and institutional engagement surrounding XRP and the XRP ledger, continuing to improve.

    "body": "Dogecoin (DOGE) has extended its rally into early 2026, showing signs of sustained momentum as the memecoin space experiences renewed interest. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Shiba Inu Price Jumped Over 13% After a nearly 30% rise over four days, DOGE is consolidating above key technical levels, supported by rising trading volumes, derivatives data, and the growing popularity of leveraged Dogecoin ETFs. DOGE's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Technical Momentum Supports Dogecoin Consolidation Dogecoin’s recent surge began after establishing a base around $0.132, breaking through resistance zones at $0.145 and $0.150. The rally peaked near $0.154 before entering a consolidation phase, a typical pattern in trending markets that suggests a healthy price structure rather than a sharp reversal. Currently trading near $0.151, DOGE remains above short-term moving averages, with immediate support levels at $0.150 and $0.145. Technical indicators, like the RSI, are above 50, signaling ongoing bullish momentum. However, some oscillators near overbought territory suggest that minor pullbacks could occur. On the upside, breaking through the $0.154 to $0.155 resistance range could pave the way for targets between $0.162 and $0.166, with potential extensions toward $0.175 and $0.180. Conversely, a drop below $0.142 may open the door to lower support levels near $0.135. DOGE ETF Activity and Whale Accumulation Fuel Rally The derivatives market reflects growing confidence in DOGE. Open interest in Dogecoin futures recently peaked at 13.47 billion contracts before a slight controlled decline, indicating leveraged positions are being managed cautiously rather than rapidly unwound. Adding to the momentum, a 2x leveraged Dogecoin ETF has become one of the top-performing ETFs in the first quarter of 2026, highlighting renewed institutional and retail interest. These ETFs amplify buying pressure by requiring fund managers to adjust their holdings to maintain leverage, effectively creating a feedback loop that can boost DOGE’s price during upswings. Large holders, or whales, have been active, purchasing hundreds of millions of DOGE tokens within a short span. This accumulation suggests confidence in further upside and can create a supply squeeze that reinforces price gains. Memecoin Revival Reflects Broader Market Trends Dogecoin’s rally is part of a larger revival in the memecoin sector. The overall market capitalization of memecoins has increased by more than 30% recently, reaching nearly $48 billion after months of underperformance. Historically, periods of low memecoin dominance often precede significant rallies, and DOGE, as the original and most liquid memecoin, frequently leads these cycles. Related Reading: John Bollinger: Bitcoin BB Squeeze Breakout Targets $107,000 The broader crypto market’s relative stability, particularly in Bitcoin and Ethereum, supports speculative flows into high-beta assets like DOGE. Additionally, social media engagement and mentions from influential figures can provide further catalysts, although these factors remain unpredictable.

    "body": "Japan’s integration of XRP into regulated capital flow infrastructure marks a decisive shift in how digital assets are being positioned within modern finance. The move suggests that XRP is transitioning from a cross-border payments tool into a component of regulated capital flow infrastructure. It also reframes XRP as a settlement layer increasingly aligned with institutional standards, compliance frameworks, and real-world financial throughput. Why This Integration Marks A Structural Inflection Point For XRP The Japanese are embedding XRP and crypto into core capital flows. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull revealed that when the Japanese finance minister openly supports crypto integration within stock exchanges, it’s not just policy. Rather, it is a regulatory green light for integration into core capital markets. Related Reading: XRP Advances As A Recognized Digital Asset In Regulated Markets — Here’s How Furthermore, this move will open the door to a $7 trillion value in equity rails and provide the altcoin a direct path to be regulated into Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs), broker access, and structured products. With SBI corridors and RLUSD already live, this has become a demand engine, not a theory. XRP has been integrated into Japan’s financial system for years, backed by real-world infrastructure and regulated clarity. The alignment between rails and regulation is rare, but now the capital can meet the infrastructure. According to an analyst known as UnknowDLT, not enough has been said about GTreasury. Currently, Ripple is partnering with JPMorgan. This partnership is an infrastructure-level connection that has placed Ripple technology to directly access the corporate payment rails used by JPMorgan and other large banks. By integrating Ripple’s stack at this layer, it will allow XRP to be used as a settlement asset or a backend liquidity layer, without the end user explicitly using the altcoin. When inserted behind the scenes, the altcoin can reduce prefunding, optimize liquidity, and act as a neutral bridge asset between currencies and systems. How Demand Steps In At Key Structural Level For XRP Crypto trader known as ZiP on X has highlighted that the support zone at the end of November has now been clearly defended, and the market responded with two strong bullish candles on the weekly chart. This is the first clear sign that demand has stepped in exactly where it should be on the higher timeframe. Related Reading: Analyst Updates XRP Price Prediction: Why $16 Is Still On The Table Currently, the XRP price is approaching a key decision area around $2.30, a zone that stands out as the area where supply may become active and attempt to show or stop the move higher. The reaction from this zone will show the market’s next move. However, if demand manages to break through the $2.30 level and hold the price above it on a weekly closing basis, it would signal acceptance, as the next significant resistance sits around $3.20.

Related Reading: Here’s Why The Shiba Inu Price Jumped Over 13% The jump coincided with a strong influx of capital into XRP-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs), technical breakout patterns, and a sharp reduction in short positions. These aspects combined to drive one of the most notable rallies in the crypto market’s early 2026 recovery phase. XRP's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview XRP ETF Inflows and Institutional Interest Fuel Gains Spot XRP ETFs recorded $48 million in net inflows on January 5 and 6, marking the largest daily inflows since their launch in November 2024. Over the past eight weeks, these ETFs have experienced a consistent inflow of approximately $1.23 billion, reflecting a growing institutional appetite for XRP exposure. The increased buying pressure from these funds is helping absorb selling pressure and reduce the available supply on exchanges. Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer at Kronos Research, noted that ETF inflows combined with XRP breaking key resistance levels on strong volume have heightened traders’ risk appetite. This institutional interest is supported by regulatory clarity following 2025’s Ripple’s settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which removed a major obstacle to adoption. Technical Breakout and Short Squeeze Accelerate Price Movement Technical analysts point to a breakout from a falling wedge pattern, with XRP maintaining levels above its 50-day moving average, a positive indicator for momentum traders. During the price surge, over $250 million in short positions were liquidated within a single hour, adding fuel to the rally by forcing short sellers to cover their bets. Renowned trader John Bollinger, inventor of the Bollinger Bands, commented that XRP is following a similar bullish pattern to Bitcoin and Ethereum but with slightly weaker momentum. Nonetheless, he suggested that XRP’s price could track Bitcoin’s upward trend, with analysts projecting a potential target near $3.50 if current support levels hold. Broader Market Context and Future Outlook XRP’s rally comes amid a broader crypto market recovery, with Bitcoin and Ethereum rising 7.4% and 9.3% respectively over the past week. On-chain data indicate a decline in XRP balances on centralized exchanges, suggesting reduced selling pressure. Institutional backing continues to grow, with PwC recently endorsing Ripple as a core player in blockchain-based financial services. Major banks such as Standard Chartered have projected XRP prices as high as $8 by the end of 2026, based on Ripple’s increasing integration in cross-border payments and settlement solutions. Related Reading: John Bollinger: Bitcoin BB Squeeze Breakout Targets $107,000 As market sentiment improves and regulatory uncertainties ease, XRP appears positioned to benefit from both technical momentum and growing institutional demand. Traders will be watching closely to see if XRP can sustain gains above key resistance zones around $2.30 and potentially push toward higher price targets.

    "body": "XRP has shown a notable uptick in price action in the past 48 hours as XRP’s price pushed higher from below $2 at the beginning of the year, but it now finds itself trading near the $2.40 region. Interestingly, this recent push is more than just a bounce, especially as a longer-term chart structure shows comparisons with XRP’s behavior ahead of its 2017 breakout. How The 2017 Structure Unfolded Before The Surge Technical analysis of XRP’s current price action on the weekly candlestick timeframe chart shows that the cryptocurrency is currently tracing out a similar price action to what it went through back in 2017 on the 3-day chart. In that earlier period, price action unfolded through a well-defined five-wave sequence, characterized by alternating phases of decline and recovery. Waves one, three, and five each pushed the price lower with corrective pressure, while waves two and four produced temporary rebounds that relieved selling pressure but failed to establish a lasting trend reversal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Parabola: What’s Different Between The Last Bull Cycle And This One? The final stage of that sequence was particularly important. During the fifth wave, XRP’s decline slowed and compressed into a falling wedge formation. XRP’s price slipped below the $0.005 level and eventually stabilized around $0.00485, where downside follow-through became increasingly limited. From here, the downside pressure gradually weakened, volatility contracted, and selling momentum faded. When XRP finally broke out of that compression, it quickly reclaimed the $0.008 zone and broke through $0.02, resulting in the start of a rally that ultimately delivered gains well in excess of 1,000%. XRP Price Chart. Source: @Steph_iscrypto According to Steph’s analysis, XRP’s recent price action is following a remarkably similar rhythm. After topping out around $3.40 in mid-2025, the cryptocurrency entered a corrective phase that pushed the price steadily lower to create a falling wedge structure. That decline found support at $1.74, where selling pressure slowed and price action stopped making aggressive new lows. Now, it seems XRP is breaking out of the falling wedge and back to solidifying its price action above $2. XRP Price Action In Focus Now that XRP is back to trading above $2 and above the falling wedge, the next course of action is to look at how the price behaves from here. Of course, the most bullish course of action is for XRP to repeat a 1,000% rally, which would place it at a price target around $22. Related Reading: Popular Crypto Founder Dumps Millions In Ethereum, Here’s What He’s Buying In terms of how this plays out, there are resistance levels to watch out for. The $2.30 area is an early test, followed by $2.50 and $2.80, which are prior consolidation levels where XRP slowed down during its push to all-time highs in 2025. After that, the $3.10 price level and the previous 2018 high at $3.40 are the major resistances that would need to be reclaimed. On the downside, sustained weakness below $1.90, and especially a move back toward $1.74, would challenge the idea that the corrective phase has fully played out.

    "title": "XRP Breaks Structure With Power — Now The Real Test Begins At $2.41",
    "body": "XRP has surged past recent resistance with impressive momentum, signaling strength in the current rally. However, the real challenge now lies at the $2.41 cost-basis zone, a key area where a significant amount of XRP was previously accumulated. How price reacts here will likely dictate whether bulls can maintain control and push toward higher targets, or if selling pressure creates a temporary pause or pullback. XRP Approaches A Critical Cost-Basis Resistance At $2.41 According to a recent update from Steph Is Crypto, XRP is now at a pivotal crossroads, with price action increasingly centered around the $2.41 level. This zone stands out as a major cost-basis wall where several technical and on-chain signals align, making it a decisive area in determining whether the current rally can extend or begin to stall. Related Reading: XRP Enters A Make-or-Break Zone As This Long-Term Support Cracks The cost-basis distribution heatmap highlights the $2.41 region as a dense supply cluster. Cost basis represents the price levels at which tokens were previously acquired. When the price returns to these areas, they often attract heightened trading activity. On-chain data shows that between $2.39 and $2.41, roughly 1.56 billion XRP were accumulated. Many holders who bought in this range may look to exit positions to break even as the price revisits the zone, introducing selling pressure and reinforcing the area as resistance. This dynamic is also reflected in the XRP price chart, which shows repeated hesitation and multiple rejections around the same level. The alignment between on-chain supply data and technical price action suggests that $2.41 is an important level that XRP must overcome decisively to unlock the next leg higher. Wave 3 Breaks Out Above The 2.618 Extension With Strong Momentum Tara revealed that XRP’s Wave 3 has delivered a powerful breakout, pushing beyond the 2.618 Fibonacci extension and clearing the macro resistance at $2.30. This move was accompanied by a strong RSI reading, signaling strength behind the advance. Related Reading: XRP Price May Be Bearish Below $2, But On-Chain Data Tells A Different Story With Wave 3 extending higher, Tara identified $2.49 as the next key upside target, which aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci extension of the fifth wave. Despite the strength of the move, Tara advised preparing for a short-term pullback. A brief retracement could allow the RSI to cool off, creating healthier conditions for the next leg higher and potentially setting up a clearer divergence on a renewed push. As long as XRP remains above the macro 0.236 Fibonacci level, the broader bullish structure stays intact. Tara is closely monitoring lower-timeframe support zones, marked in green, while continuing to track the move as a developing Wave 1/3 impulse.
