    "title": "Bitcoin Inflow Slowdown: CryptoQuant Founder Says Sentiment Could Take Months To Recover",
    "body": "The founder and CEO of on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has revealed how Bitcoin on-chain capital inflows have stalled over the last couple of months. Bitcoin Realized Cap Has Witnessed A Slowdown Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has talked about how on-chain capital inflows have been weakening for Bitcoin recently. “After about 2.5 years of growth, realized cap has stalled over the past month,” noted Young Ju. The “Realized Cap” here refers to an on-chain capitalization model for Bitcoin that calculates its total value by assuming the value of each coin in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge: Longs Dominate BTC, While ETH Shorts Rise Since the last transaction of any coin is likely to represent the last instance of it changing hands, the price at that time can be considered as its current cost basis. Therefore, the Realized Cap is just a sum of the cost basis of the entire BTC supply. In other words, it tracks the capital that the investors used to purchase their tokens. Realized Cap had been enjoying growth for the last couple of years, but as the CryptoQuant founder has revealed, capital inflows have dropped off. This suggests a decline in sentiment around Bitcoin. The turnaround in sentiment is also visible through the analytics firm’s PnL Index, which incorporates key on-chain indicators to build a single valuation metric for BTC. The indicators in question are the MVRV Ratio, NUPL, and STH/LTH SOPR. The first two both deal with the amount of unrealized profit or loss held by the investors as a whole, while the latter provides a look into investor profit-taking. Below is the chart shared by Young Ju that shows the trend in the 365-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin PnL Index over the history of the asset. From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin PnL Index saw its 365-day MA reach a high earlier in the year, implying that the coin had potentially become overvalued. Since then, the metric has seen a reversal to the downside. Currently, its value is still notably positive, so the cryptocurrency may be considered to be in a bullish phase, but historically, drawdowns have tended to lead into bear markets. Though there were a couple of instances where this pattern didn’t hold. One being the aftermath of the COVID crash and the other the decline that occurred in the early months of 2025.

So far, the indicator hasn’t shown signs of any turnaround back to the upside, although it should be noted that it’s an average over the past year, so there is some delay attached. Based on the on-chain trend, Young Ju has said, “Sentiment recovery might take a few months.” BTC Price Bitcoin has made recovery from last week’s plunge as its price is now back at $89,800.

    "title": "Here’s Why This Bitcoin Bounce Is Designed To Hurt The Most",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s recent bounce may look like a sign of renewed strength, but the price action tells a more deceptive story. With downside liquidity still thin and support holding firm, the market appears primed for a move that draws in eager bulls rather than rewarding them. This rally could be less about recovery and more about setting the stage for maximum pain when sentiment flips. Aligning The Mid- And Long-Term Bitcoin Outlook During an in-depth technical and psychological analysis, Mr. Wall Street explained that his broader outlook on Bitcoin had already been clarified a week earlier, after some confusion around his mid and long-term stance. With those time horizons now clearly defined, he turned his focus to the short-term picture, outlining current market behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin In Standby Mode: Weekend Ranges Rule Before Holiday ‘Chop’ He reiterated that while his mid-term bias on Bitcoin remains bearish, the short-term structure has turned bullish. The reason centered on insufficient downside liquidity to justify market makers initiating the next major leg lower. This imbalance supported the case for a temporary relief move to the upside. Thus, Mr. Wall Street placed long positions around the Value Area Low between $80,000 and $84,000 on a bounce that could later evolve into a bull trap. Shortly after, Bitcoin dipped and successfully retested the $84,000 level, which aligns with the weekly MA100, following several deceptive upside moves. As a result, his long orders were filled as planned, leaving him holding a position from $84,550. The analyst noted that he plans to exit only in the $98,000–$104,000 zone, where a Fair Value Gap converges with heavy liquidity, making it an ideal area to take profit. Being In Longs Doesn’t Change The Macro Bearish Thesis Mr. Wall Street clarified that holding long positions does not signal a bullish shift on Bitcoin. The broader outlook remains bearish, with expectations for the next major downside move toward the $64,000–$70,000 region. In the short term, Bitcoin is sitting at strong support while downside liquidity is limited, which reduces the probability of an immediate continuation lower. Related Reading: Citi Analysts Project Bitcoin Price Could Reach $189,000 Next Year In Bullish Scenario A more logical scenario involves market makers engineering a bullish move to attract retail participation. As late buyers enter long positions, they gradually become exit liquidity, setting the stage for a larger downside move once sufficient liquidity is built. He also mentioned the $68,000–$74,000 zone had become too widely anticipated to function as a true “maximum pain” area capable of resetting market structure. For that reason, the downside target was revised lower to the $64,000–$70,000 range, with expectations that this zone could be reached in late Q1 or early Q2 of 2026. This level represents an initial major target rather than the final bottom. Recent price action was highlighted as a clear example of these dynamics. Bitcoin’s rapid move from $87,000 to $90,000, followed by a sharp drop to $85,000 within hours, resulted in widespread liquidations. Many traders chased the upside and were quickly trapped, and fake moves in both directions are likely to continue as liquidity is built ahead of a larger move lower.

    "title": "New Crypto Tax Proposal: Bipartisan House Duo Pushes For Stablecoin Safe Harbor",
    "body": "In the wake of a significant shift in crypto regulation spurred by the new White House administration under President Donald Trump, lawmakers are working on a fresh tax framework aimed at providing clarity and a safe harbor for certain transactions involving stablecoins. Proposed Crypto Tax Framework Representatives Max Miller from Ohio and Steven Horsford from Nevada have drafted a preliminary proposal that seeks to align the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies with that of traditional securities. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, the draft consists of a blend of policy objectives and bill language not yet formally approved. Related Reading: Pundit Shares Why XRP Will Become Expensive And A $1,000 Price Tag Is Possible One of the key features of this draft legislation is its aim to exempt capital gains tax for transactions involving regulated stablecoins. Specifically, the proposal proposes to shield transactions that consistently maintain a value between $0.99 and $1.01 from taxation. However, this exemption is limited to transactions under $200, and the final text may modify which tokens will qualify for this safe harbor, as advised by aides to both congressmen. The proposal also attempts to establish safe harbors for rewards earned through activities like staking, which involves verifying blockchain transactions. Representative Miller emphasized that “America’s tax code has failed to keep pace with modern financial technology.” He described the bipartisan bill as a means to inject clarity, fairness, and common sense into the taxation of digital assets. The proposed draft also addresses the taxation of rewards earned through staking and mining cryptocurrencies, which involves verifying transactions within blockchain networks. Aligning Digital Assets With Securities Tax Regime Under guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued during the Biden administration, rewards obtained from staking are taxed at the time of receipt. Republican lawmakers have voiced concerns regarding this approach, arguing that it taxes assets before owners realize a gain. Conversely, Democrats maintain that these rewards should be classified as compensation and taxed upon receipt. To navigate this divide, Miller and Horsford aim to find a compromise, allowing taxpayers to defer tax on rewards for up to five years. After this period, the rewards would be taxed as income based on their fair market value. Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis, who recently announced that she will not be running for re-election next year, had previously introduced crypto tax legislation that would leave such rewards untaxed until they are sold. This legislation would align more closely with industry preferences. Related Reading: Saylor Sparks Bitcoin Speculation With ‘Green Dots’ Signal Additionally, the draft aims to bring digital assets under the same tax regime that governs securities and, in some cases, commodities transactions. It proposes to include cryptocurrencies in capital gains tax exemptions for foreign investors trading securities through US-based intermediaries like brokers or exchanges. Furthermore, the plan would permit cryptocurrency traders to utilize mark-to-market accounting, allowing them to recognize unrealized gains and losses based on fair market value at the end of each year. The proposed legislation also seeks to impose restrictions on deducting losses from wash trades for digital assets and “close existing loopholes” that facilitate transactions designed to lock in cryptocurrency gains while postponing the associated tax liability.

    "title": "Dogecoin Breaks Key Support as Traders Reassess Long-Term Outlook Ahead of 2026",
    "body": "Dogecoin’s (DOGE) drop below a long-held support level has pushed traders and long-term holders to reassess the token’s outlook heading into 2026. Once viewed as relatively resilient within the speculative crypto space, DOGE is now under pressure after losing key technical structure and momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Feels The Weight Of Quantum Risk Concerns, Industry Leaders Warn DOGE is down about 66% over the past year and trades near $0.13, far below levels that previously drew consistent buying. The decline reflects thinner liquidity, weaker speculative interest, and a market increasingly favoring assets with clearer narratives, suggesting that market size alone may no longer be a price support. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Key Support Gives Way as Selling Pressure Builds In the past week, Dogecoin (DOGE) slipped below the $0.129 area, a level that had capped losses through several consolidation phases. The breakdown was accompanied by elevated trading volume, signaling active selling rather than a slow drift lower. Intraday volatility expanded to around 4%, reflecting heightened sensitivity as traders reacted to the loss of range support. Technical analysts note that DOGE has also broken a multi-year ascending trendline that guided price action through much of the 2024 cycle. On shorter timeframes, the token now trades below key moving averages, with rebounds toward $0.132–$0.134 consistently meeting selling interest. Technical Signals Point to a Fragile Dogecoin Structure Momentum indicators continue to lean lower, and several analysts warn that failure to hold the nearby $0.128 level could expose DOGE to deeper downside. Below that, the next widely watched support zone sits near $0.090, implying a potential decline of around 30% from current levels if bearish pressure accelerates. Ichimoku-based signals have also turned negative, reinforcing the view that the broader trend has shifted. While short-term countertrend patterns occasionally emerge, they carry less weight against the backdrop of a confirmed break in higher-timeframe structure. Long-Term Outlook Faces a Test Into 2026 Beyond charts, Dogecoin’s longer-term outlook remains uncertain. Spot DOGE ETFs launched in late 2025 introduced a new source of demand, but it is still unclear whether that capital will prove sticky enough to offset ongoing selling. Meanwhile, discussions around adding utility through sidechains or layer-2 solutions continue within the developer community, though progress has been slow and fragmented.

As 2026 approaches, traders appear increasingly focused on whether DOGE can stabilize above broken support and attract sustained demand. Cover image from ChatGPT, DOGEUSD chart from Tradingview",

    "body": "While most leading crypto-based Exchange-Traded funds (ETFs) recorded significant outflows last week, XRP investment products went against the current and attracted over $80 million in inflows, ending the week with a green performance. Related Reading: Analyst Shares ‘Cold, Hard Truth’ For Bitcoin Investors As Price Struggles XRP ETFs Steal The Spotlight XRP ETFs continue to show strong demand, recording a 25-day streak last Friday and closing the week with a positive net flow. Notably, crypto investment products registered a negative performance last week, seeing nearly a billion dollars in outflows. According to CoinShares’ weekly report, digital asset-based funds ended the week in the red for the first time in four weeks, with outflows totaling $952 million. This marks the products’ fourth-worst weekly performance of the year. CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill, suggested that the negative market reaction was fueled by the delays in the US crypto market structure bill, which was initially anticipated to be passed before the end of the year. This “has prolonged regulatory uncertainty for the asset class, alongside concerns over continued selling by whale investors,” the report noted. The negative market sentiment was mostly focused in the US, which recorded $990 million in outflows last week. Ethereum (ETH) funds suffered the largest outflows, registering $555 million in negative net flows. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) investment products came in second with $460m in outflows. On the contrary, XRP ETFs saw overall support with positive net flows throughout the whole week. According to SoSoValue data, the category closes the week with $82.04 million in inflows, marking a 6-week positive streak. XRP’s Correction Already Over? Amid this performance, XRP’s price also ended the week recovering from the latest market correction, which sent its price to a two-month low of $1.77. Market observer BitGuru affirmed that XRP has completed its downtrend and liquidity grab, and is currently stabilizing at a key historical demand zone. Per the analyst, “selling pressure is fading, structure is flattening, and this is where smart money usually starts positioning, not where panic happens.” Similarly, trader Niels suggested that XRP’s corrective phase may be over as it appears to be forming a double bottom pattern. “RSI has bottomed out already, and now the price is showing good signs too,” the trader affirmed, adding that “XRP had a fakeout below the support level before reclaiming the zone.” To Niels, if the market shows momentum, the cryptocurrency could surge 20%-25% toward the $2.30-$2.50 area in the next few weeks. Recently, the trader affirmed that once XRP breaks above the $2.20 resistance, where the pattern’s neckline is situated, it could rally to the $2.80-$3.00 area within a month. Related Reading: Fundstrat Predicts Ethereum Drop To $1,800 In H1 2026 Meanwhile, analyst ChartNerd highlighted a bullish divergence on XRP’s chart. “Price action is adhering to the lower low price action trendline whilst forming higher lows on the RSI,” he explained, suggesting that price could move to higher levels. He also noted that if the altcoin fails to break the 20 EMA, currently around the $1.98 level, the price would “simply resort back to the lower low trendline for support, where we likely see more relief.” As of this writing, XRP is trading at $1.93, a 1.1% increase in the weekly timeframe.

    "body": "Data shows traders have set up fresh Bitcoin positions on the perpetual futures market during the past day, and the Funding Rate suggests they are long bets. Bitcoin Open Interest Has Witnessed An Uptick According to data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the surge Bitcoin has seen to kick off Monday has come alongside a spike in the Bitcoin perpetual futures Open Interest. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inflow Slowdown: CryptoQuant Founder Says Sentiment Could Take Months To Recover The “Open Interest” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of BTC perpetual futures positions that are currently open on all derivatives exchanges. When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the market. Since such a trend usually accompanies an increase in leverage for the sector, it can lead to more volatility for the asset. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies investors are either pulling back on risk or getting liquidated by their platform. This kind of trend can result in the cryptocurrency’s price behaving in a more stable manner. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest over the last couple of weeks: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest rose from 304,000 BTC to 310,000 BTC as the cryptocurrency observed a recovery surge to $90,000 during the past day. This represents an increase of about 2%, which isn’t much, but still signals that the rally encouraged traders to open up new positions on the perpetual futures market. The Open Interest includes both types of positions when calculating its value, so it contains no information about whether positions have a bias toward shorts or longs. Another metric called the Funding Rate can be used to determine that instead. This indicator measures the amount of periodic fee that perpetual futures traders are exchanging between each other. A positive value implies long investors are paying a premium to the shorts in order to hold onto their positions, while a negative one implies bearish bets are dominant. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Outflows Soar To $978M: Sign Of Dip Buying? As the below chart shows, the Bitcoin Funding Rate has been positive for much of the last two weeks, indicating that a bullish sentiment has been shared by the majority of perpetual futures traders. This metric also noted an uptick alongside the increase in the Open Interest, going from 0.04% to 0.09%. “This combination signals a renewed buildup in leveraged long positioning, as perpetual traders position for a potential year-end move,” noted Glassnode. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen a bit of a pullback since its surge above $90,000 as its price is now back at $89,500.

    "title": "Altcoin Season Index Crashes To Low 17 As Bitcoin Price Struggles, What This Means",
    "body": "There’s been a major shift in profitability since the Bitcoin price crashed from $126,000, and altcoins have borne the brunt of it. With major altcoins down between 30% and 80% from their all-time high values, calls for an altcoin season have gone down drastically. This has been reflected in the performance of the Altcoin Season Index, falling to one of the lowest recorded levels in 2025 as the year draws to an end. Altcoin Season Index Says Losses Are The Order Of The Day The Altcoin Season Index Chart on the CoinMarketCap website, which tracks the performance of altcoins against Bitcoin, has now fallen below 20 again. This index collates the performance of the top 100 altcoins in the market, comparing their 90-day performance to that of Bitcoin, in order to pinpoint whether the market is currently experiencing an altcoin season. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Remains Stuck Inside This Range, But A Breakout Could Follow The index ranks the performance on a scale of 1-100, depending on how many altcoins out of the top 100 are outperforming Bitcoin, and uses that to score the market. At the time of writing, the Altcoin Season Index was sitting at a score of 17, which means only 17 of the top 100 altcoins have seen a better performance than Bitcoin in the last 90 days. With the index’s score sitting this low, it suggests that altcoins are currently in a bear market. Additionally, Ethereum, which is often the altcoin leader when it comes to an alt season, is still underperforming compared to Bitcoin. The second-largest cryptocurrency has recorded a 28.30% decrease in the last 90 days, while Bitcoin is down 21.10% in comparison. How To Know If Altcoins Are In A Bull Run? To know if the altcoin market is experiencing an altcoin season, the index would have to read at a score of 75 or higher. This is when the majority of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin in a 3-month period, and their combined market cap surpasses that of the leading cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Pundit Shares Why XRP Will Become Expensive And A $1,000 Price Tag Is Possible Scores lower than 75 suggest that the market is yet to enter a full-blown altcoin season, and the lower it goes, the higher the chances that altcoins are experiencing a bear market. However, the higher the Altcoin Season Index score is, nearing 100, the more likely it is that the altcoin market may be experiencing a top. Altcoin seasons are often characterized by rapid increases in price, with 100% rallies on a daily basis being the norm. The last major altcoin season was back in 2021, and while the expectation was that another altcoin season would begin in 2025, this has not been the case.

    "body": "JPMorgan Chase & Co. is considering offering cryptocurrency trading services to its institutional clients, based on reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The move is reported to be in early stages and has not been confirmed by the bank. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s $126K Sprint May Be Over — Fidelity Predicts 2026 Slide Institutional Demand And Product Options Reports have disclosed that the bank is looking at a range of possible offerings, including spot trades and derivatives, as it tests whether client demand justifies a rollout. Decisions will depend on risk assessments and the regulatory environment, sources say. Banks Respond To A Shifting Market Wall Street is already moving closer to crypto. Morgan Stanley, for example, plans to make crypto trading available on its E*Trade platform by mid-2026, a step that shows firms are racing to meet investor interest. The global crypto market is estimated to be about $3.1 trillion, with Bitcoin close to $1.8 trillion of that total, according to market data cited by reporters. JPMorgan Chase reportedly plans launching crypto trading services for institutional clients. https://t.co/Ggj0bOxcUc — TheStreet (@TheStreet) December 22, 2025 Plans To Start Without Custody Several industry reports say JPMorgan may initially focus on executing trades rather than holding clients’ tokens — that is, the firm would facilitate transactions but not provide custody services at first. That approach would let the bank offer access while limiting direct exposure. Banking History And Changing Views JPMorgan’s public position on crypto has shifted over time. Its CEO was once highly critical of Bitcoin, yet the firm has been testing blockchain and tokenization projects in recent years. The broader policy climate has also turned more favorable: US President Donald Trump has taken a stance seen by some observers as supportive of crypto, and that has affected industry calculations. What This Would Mean For Clients If JPMorgan moves ahead, clients could gain access to bank-grade execution for Bitcoin and other tokens, potentially with institutional custodians or third-party safekeeping used where needed. Market makers and asset managers would likely react quickly; liquidity could increase, and trading costs might shift. Those outcomes would depend on the exact products launched and on regulatory guardrails. Collateral And Tokenization Moves Earlier This Year The bank has already taken other crypto steps. In October, Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan planned to allow institutional clients to use Bitcoin and Ether as collateral for loans by the end of the year, a sign that the firm is testing ways to bring crypto into traditional banking functions. Related Reading: Saylor Sparks Bitcoin Speculation With ‘Green Dots’ Signal Bitcoin Price Reaction Traders reacted positively to the news of JPMorgan exploring crypto trading, sending Bitcoin briefly higher into the $88,000–$90,000 range. While the price didn’t break past $90,000 decisively, the announcement added support near existing resistance levels and boosted market sentiment. Analysts note that any lasting price impact will depend on whether JPMorgan actually launches trading services and how US regulators respond, but for now, the story has reinforced optimism among institutional and retail investors alike.

    "body": "According to recent interviews, billionaire investor Ray Dalio has sharpened his caution about Bitcoin’s fit for official reserves while still recognizing its scarce nature. Related Reading: Before You Sell Bitcoin For Gold, Hear This Warning He said that Bitcoin carries money-like qualities because of its limited supply, but he drew a firm line over who should hold it on a balance sheet. Dalio said public transaction records and the risk of outside interference make it hard for reserve managers to treat Bitcoin the same way they treat gold. Dalio Flags Traceability Concerns Dalio warned that the open ledger that underpins Bitcoin creates vulnerabilities for large custodians. He argued that public transactions can be traced and, in some scenarios, interrupted, which raises concerns for institutions charged with protecting national wealth. NEW: RAY DALIO SAYS THAT BITCOIN IS “UNLIKELY TO BE HELD SIGNIFICANTLY BY CENTRAL BANKS” – TRANSACTIONS ARE TOO TRANSPARENT, THE GOVERNMENT CAN INTERFERE WITH THEM pic.twitter.com/NzxrhBzp4m — DEGEN NEWS (@DegenerateNews) December 20, 2025 He contrasted this with gold, which he said is harder for authorities to control once it is taken out of the formal financial system. He also raised security worries, including the possibility that Bitcoin could be cracked, broken, or controlled in ways that would alter its long-term usefulness as a store of value. Stablecoins Seen As Transactional Tools Based on reports, Dalio also gave a low rating to stablecoins as long-term holdings. He pointed out that stablecoins are tied to fiat currencies and generally do not pay interest, so they work well for quick transfers but not as wealth preservation. He said he keeps some exposure to Bitcoin personally — “a little bit” — but places gold ahead of it when the goal is an asset shielded from state actions. Last year, Dalio urged investors to favor scarce assets like gold and Bitcoin over debt instruments as many big economies wrestle with rising debt. Institutional Demand And Market Signals Crypto markets are moving closer to mainstream finance with spot Bitcoin ETFs and improved custody services, and market structure is shifting. BTC will hit $250k by year-end 2027. 2026 is too chaotic to predict, though Bitcoin making new all-time highs in 2026 is still possible. Options markets are currently pricing about equal odds of $70k or $130k for month-end June 2026, and equal odds of $50k or $250k by year-end… — Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) December 21, 2025 According to Galaxy Research, overlapping macro and market risks make Bitcoin unusually hard to forecast in 2026. Galaxy’s team says options pricing and volatility trends show Bitcoin acting more like a macro asset than a pure high-growth gamble. The same research group nonetheless kept a long-term bullish stance, projecting that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by the end of 2027. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s $126K Sprint May Be Over — Fidelity Predicts 2026 Slide Macro Signals And Price Outlook That mix of views highlights a separation between policy suitability and price potential.

    "title": "Why This Friday Could Be Very Big For The Bitcoin Price",
    "body": "The Bitcoin price could experience major swings this Friday as billions of dollars in options are set to expire. A crypto market expert has warned that the scale of this event could trigger “something big,” potentially affecting both volatility and the actions of retail and institutional investors. Bitcoin Price Braces For Major Moves This Friday On Monday, crypto analyst NoLimit signaled that this upcoming Friday could be a historic moment for Bitcoin. According to the expert, over $23.6 billion worth of Bitcoin options are scheduled to expire on December 26, marking the largest options expiry the market has ever seen. The analyst has stated that anyone with crypto holdings should pay close attention. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Bull And Bear Cases That Crypto Traders Should Know About NoLimit explained that an options expiry involves leveraged bets on Bitcoin’s price. He stated that calls are wagers that the price will rise, while puts predict it will fall. The analyst also emphasized that when these options expire, they either become worthless or force buying and selling in the spot market to hedge the positions. He also highlighted that with $23.6 billion in options expiring in a single day, a massive amount of risk will be removed from dealer books all at once. According to the analysis, this risk offloading is a key driver of market volatility, as the magnitude of the expiry is unprecedented. Looking at the data, previous year-end expiries were significantly smaller. In 2021, the options expiry was around $6 billion, followed by $2.4 billion in 2022. It climbed to $11 billion in 2023 and reached $19.8 billion in 2024. NoLimit has suggested that this year’s jump to $23.6 billion represents a significant shift in market dynamics. The analyst pointed out that retail investors no longer dominate the market. He stated that institutional-sized risk is now being repriced in real time, and this Friday could trigger significant price movements. NoLimit also suggested that the scale and timing of the expiry make it a critical event for traders and investors in the market. Analyst Reveals Why This Friday Truly Matters In his analysis, NoLimit outlined the specific reasons why this Friday truly matters as Bitcoin’s $23.6 billion options prepare to expire. He explained that dealers are heavily hedged around key strikes, and once expiry hits, those hedges are removed. As a result, the shift can trigger sharp moves for Bitcoin in either direction. Related Reading: Don’t Expect A Fast Bitcoin Move – Here’s How Long The Last Leg Could Take The analyst noted that current market conditions could further amplify the impact. According to his analysis, Bitcoin’s liquidity is extremely low during the holiday week, and less volume typically means each order has more influence. As a result, the expert stated that a violent price move could occur even without major news. NoLimit also noted that much of Bitcoin’s Open Interest is concentrated near the major psychological levels. Once the expiry passes, this open interest disappears entirely. He explained that this is why markets often experience sideways trading leading into expiry, followed by a clear directional move shortly afterward. The analyst added that volatility is the key setup this week. He says the crucial moment to watch is the Bitcoin price after the expiry, not before.

    "body": "Solana (SOL) has entered the final stretch of 2025 under sustained pressure, caught between a weakening price structure and signs of steady institutional interest. Related Reading: Dogecoin: Why This One Price Level Is Drawing All the Attention Following a sharp 39% decline in the fourth quarter, SOL is struggling to regain momentum, trading in the low-$120 range as traders focus on whether key support levels can be sustained. The contrast between falling network activity and continued inflows into investment products has left the market divided on what comes next. While ETF-linked demand suggests confidence in Solana’s longer-term relevance, near-term price action remains fragile. With liquidity thinning toward year-end and broader crypto sentiment still cautious, SOL’s ability to defend lower support zones may shape how the market opens 2026. SOL's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Solana Network Slowdown and Bearish Technical Signals One of the main pressures on SOL has been a sharp drop in on-chain activity. The number of active users on the network decreased from approximately 30 million in late 2024 to under one million in Q4 2025, resulting in a decline in fee revenue and weakening demand for the token. This slowdown has coincided with a broader market pullback, as the total crypto market capitalization slipped toward $2.9 trillion and investors withdrew nearly $1 billion from digital asset investment products in a single week. Technically, momentum indicators remain tilted to the downside. SOL has posted a negative MACD reading and an RSI below neutral levels, while repeated failures to reclaim the $126–$130 zone have triggered long liquidations. Analysts warn that a loss of the $120 area could expose SOL to a deeper move toward $110, a level increasingly cited as a critical downside marker. ETF Inflows Highlight Institutional Divergence Despite weak price action, Solana-linked exchange-traded products have continued to attract capital. Recent data show more than $69 million in net inflows, setting SOL apart from Bitcoin and Ethereum products, which have seen net outflows. This divergence suggests some institutional investors are accumulating at lower prices, even as short-term traders remain defensive. Market watchers note that this gap between fund flows and spot price reflects differing time horizons. Institutions appear to be focused on Solana’s role as infrastructure for payments, tokenization, and high-throughput applications, while the spot market remains constrained by technical resistance and declining retail activity. Cross-chain Developments and Key SOL Levels Ahead Adding to the narrative, recent comments from Charles Hoskinson and Anatoly Yakovenko have reignited discussion around interoperability, with both founders signaling openness to a future cross-chain bridge between Solana and Cardano. While still early and informal, such developments spotlight ongoing efforts to expand liquidity and utility across ecosystems. Traders currently remain focused on price levels rather than long-term vision. Holding above $120 could stabilize sentiment, but a clear break below it would likely shift attention firmly to the $110 support zone.

    "title": "XRP Breaks $1.95 Support After 13 Months, Analyst Sees $0.90 Target",
    "body": "XRP has slipped below a level that, for much of the past year, acted like a structural anchor for the chart: the $1.95 area. Crypto analyst Guy on the Earth (@guyontheearth) argued that XRP has now closed under that zone on a higher timeframe, calling out the two-week chart specifically. “For the first time in 13 months XRP has closed under this monthly support at $1.95 on the 2 week chart,” he wrote. “It’s the second time on the weekly this has happened with April tariffs being the first.” The 2-Weekly Close Is Crucial For XRP From there, his analysis went straight to the downside implication. “The technical target of this break down is 90c,” he added. “Do with this information what you have to. Everyone must make their own decisions at this time. The goal is getting back above $1.95.” The way he laid it out, $1.95 was not simply a mid-range price level but the lower boundary of a broader consolidation “rectangle.” Losing it, in that framework, opens the door to a measured move lower — with the reclaim of $1.95 as the key invalidation. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecasts For 2026 Unveiled By AI Simulation: Should Investors Remain Bullish? He also offered a risk-management approach for holders who are uncomfortable sitting through a potential continuation move. “If you are uncomfortable holding your bags with this breakdown – sell to reduce risk to where you feel comfortable,” he wrote. “Buy back on a close above $1.95 on the daily ( or a timeframe that you believe in) and your % loss of XRP is next to nothing. But should we go to 90c you are looking at a further 50% loss in capital.” For those treating the move as an opportunity rather than a warning sign, he mapped out incremental levels he views as potential buy zones on the way down. “Alternatively if you believe in XRP longer term and don’t like trading at all – keep buying on the way down,” he wrote. “Key levels are at $1.61, $1.42 and finally the 90c target and the 75c initial breakout.” Even in a bearish framing, he cautioned against assuming a straight-line cascade into every marked level. “We have went in a straight line down for weeks so it is unlikely that these targets would all be hit imminently,” he said. “$1.42 lowest this week if things get really ugly – not massively likely but possible with this breakdown and a big sell off in BTC to lower lows.” Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Keeps Crashing Not everyone agreed with the choice of timeframe used to call the breakdown. One account, XRP whale (@cryptoXRPwhale), pushed back on the premise: “2 week chart is not significant. You can’t choose a specific timeframe and say it’s a structure breakdown that fits your narrative… lol” Guy responded by reiterating that the level being referenced is higher-timeframe support, not a short-term marker. “Look at the chart. It held 13 months and now broke structure,” he wrote. “The lower boundary is monthly support. I’ve said all this.” There was also an attempt in the replies to flip the bearish target into a bullish setup. “Any price under $1 will be short-lived & sets $XRP up for a stronger push to the upside past ATH,” wrote Lawrence Bensen (@Lawrence_Bensen), referencing prior cycle lows and a reported wick below $1 on Binance earlier in the cycle. Guy acknowledged the point while keeping the technical math intact. “Yeah for sure – it has already been to 90c on Binance [on October 10],” he wrote. “I think we will recover before going as low as 90c – but that is the technical target of losing this consolidation.” His near-term bias, meanwhile, leaned toward caution largely on liquidity conditions rather than an absolute conviction that $0.90 must print. “My bias is that I find it hard to believe at Christmas people are going to throw heaps of money in this market,” he wrote. “Low liquidity has been an issue anyways and this week wont help. So the slow bleed continues.” At press time, XRP stood at $1.89. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Gold & Silver Break Out While Bitcoin Chops: Why Capital Is Flowing Into Precious Metals",
    "body": "Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim the $90,000 level, and market confidence continues to deteriorate as an increasing number of analysts begin to call for a prolonged bear market. Sentiment has turned decisively cautious, with investors reassessing risk exposure and preparing for a potentially challenging period ahead. Despite multiple attempts to stabilize, price action remains compressed, offering little confirmation that bullish momentum is ready to return. Related Reading: The Gold-to-Bitcoin Rotation Narrative Gains Strength: A Data-Driven Review According to an analysis by XWIN Research Japan, the current market phase is best described as a range-bound consolidation following a high-level correction, with momentum conditionally tilted to the downside. While Bitcoin has remained largely sideways over the past three months, traditional safe-haven assets have followed a very different trajectory. Gold and silver have continued to push higher, reflecting rising demand for defensive assets amid persistent geopolitical tensions, policy uncertainty, and expectations of lower real interest rates. This divergence highlights a structural challenge for Bitcoin in the current macro environment. Institutional capital can allocate to precious metals with relative ease, benefiting from deep liquidity, established market infrastructure, and clear regulatory frameworks. Silver, in particular, has amplified gold’s move, supported by tighter supply dynamics and greater sensitivity to speculative flows. Bitcoin’s Role as a Risk Asset Limits Its Upside The analysis explains that Bitcoin has not followed gold and silver higher because it is still treated primarily as a high-beta risk asset, rather than a pure safe haven. In risk-off environments, capital typically flows first into gold and government bonds, where investors seek stability and capital preservation. Bitcoin, by contrast, is often a secondary consideration, attracting flows only after confidence improves. Unlike gold’s long-term and relatively price-insensitive buyer base, Bitcoin remains more exposed to short-term positioning and marginal demand, making broad macro tailwinds insufficient on their own to sustain a durable uptrend. CryptoQuant data reinforces this interpretation. Bitcoin’s apparent demand has recently turned negative, signaling that fresh demand is not expanding even as prices hold at relatively elevated levels. At the same time, Short-Term Holder SOPR has spent extended periods below 1, indicating that short-term participants are selling at a loss or near breakeven. This behavior typically adds selling pressure on rebounds, as underwater holders use price strength to exit positions. As long as capital continues to favor gold and silver, Bitcoin’s internal demand structure remains a key constraint. The base case points to continued support for precious metals, while Bitcoin’s upside stays capped by weak demand and short-term holder pressure. That view would only change if apparent demand turns sustainably positive and STH SOPR reclaims and holds above 1.

The chart shows that price has lost the short-term bullish structure, with BTC now firmly below the 50-day moving average (blue), which has started to slope downward. This confirms that short-term momentum has turned negative and rallies are facing increasing overhead supply. More importantly, price is now testing the 100-day moving average (green), which sits just above the current level and has acted as dynamic support throughout much of this cycle. The market’s reaction around this zone is critical. A sustained hold above the 100-day MA could allow Bitcoin to stabilize and form a base, while a decisive breakdown would likely expose the 200-day moving average (red), currently rising near the low $80,000s. Related Reading: Ethereum Market Structure Strengthens: Binance Netflows Point to Long-Term Conviction Volume dynamics reinforce the cautious outlook. The sell-off from the October peak was accompanied by elevated volume, signaling distribution rather than a shallow pullback. Since then, volume has tapered off, suggesting a lack of aggressive dip-buying interest at current levels. Structurally, Bitcoin remains in a broader uptrend as long as it holds above the 200-day MA, but the loss of the 50-day and weakening momentum indicate consolidation or further downside risk in the near term. Bulls need a recovery back above $90,000 to regain control and shift sentiment meaningfully. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Inflows Collapse While Binance Retains Relative Activity – Details",
    "body": "Bitcoin is on track to close the year in negative territory, a development that has reinforced growing concerns among analysts who are increasingly positioning for a potential bear market ahead. After failing to sustain momentum above key psychological and technical levels, market sentiment has shifted toward caution, with investors closely monitoring liquidity behavior and exchange flows for early signals of regime change. Related Reading: The Gold-to-Bitcoin Rotation Narrative Gains Strength: A Data-Driven Review Recent analysis from Arab Chain, based on CryptoQuant’s Exchange Inflow Value (7-day cumulative) metric, highlights a notable divergence in liquidity patterns between major exchanges. The data aggregates Bitcoin and Ethereum inflows, providing a broader view of risk positioning across the two largest crypto assets. On November 24, when Bitcoin was trading around $88,438, Coinbase recorded seven-day cumulative inflows totaling approximately $21.0 billion. In contrast, Binance saw lower, though still significant, inflows near $15.3 billion. What stands out is that these elevated inflows occurred while prices were already well below prior highs. Rather than signaling aggressive accumulation, the data points to increased exchange activity consistent with portfolio rebalancing, hedging, or preparation for potential distribution. Exchange Inflows Signal Liquidity Tightening Despite Stable Bitcoin Prices By December 21, Bitcoin was trading near $88,635. Only marginally higher than late-November levels and still locked within a narrow consolidation range. While price action showed little progress, exchange flow data pointed to a notable shift in market conditions. Updated on-chain figures indicate that liquidity entering major trading venues declined sharply over the span of just a few weeks, underscoring a cooling in overall market activity. Coinbase, often used as a proxy for institutional and US-based flows, saw seven-day cumulative inflows fall to roughly $7.8 billion. That represents a steep drop of more than 60% compared with inflow levels observed in late November. Binance also experienced a contraction, but the decline was materially less severe, with inflows totaling about $10.3 billion over the same period. As a result, Binance surpassed Coinbase in net inflows during December, reversing the earlier dynamic. This divergence suggests that while broad liquidity has tightened, trading activity has become more concentrated on venues associated with shorter-term positioning and active risk management. At the same time, the absence of a significant price reaction highlights how Bitcoin has continued to trade sideways even as fresh capital flows slowed. Taken together, the data points to a market operating with reduced turnover and lower urgency on both the buy and sell side. Bitcoin’s ability to remain range-bound amid shrinking inflows reflects a quieter, more constrained liquidity environment compared with conditions seen just one month earlier.

The structure now reflects a clear shift in short-term trend dynamics, with price firmly below its major daily moving averages. Notably, Bitcoin has lost the 111-day and 200-day simple moving averages. Both of which have started to roll over and act as dynamic resistance rather than support. The rejection from the $110,000–$115,000 zone marked a decisive lower high, followed by an impulsive sell-off toward the mid-$80,000 range. Since then, price action has compressed into a narrow consolidation, suggesting temporary stabilization rather than a confirmed reversal. However, the inability to reclaim the declining moving averages indicates that upside attempts remain fragile. Related Reading: Ethereum Traders Chase Upside With Historic Leverage – Breakout Fuel Or Fragile Setup? Volume behavior adds to the cautious outlook. Selling pressure expanded during the initial breakdown, while subsequent rebounds have occurred on muted volume, signaling limited conviction from buyers. This imbalance suggests that dip-buying demand is present but not strong enough to force a trend shift. From a technical perspective, the $85,000–$88,000 area has become a critical near-term support zone. A sustained hold could allow for range formation. Failure to defend this level would increase the risk of a deeper retracement. For sentiment to improve, Bitcoin would need to reclaim the $95,000–$100,000 region and stabilize above its key daily averages. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",
