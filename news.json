    "title": "Analyst Sets Bitcoin Next Target At $95k-$96k – Here’s Why",
    "body": "The Bitcoin market experienced a moderate price rebound over the past week, following a prolonged period of price correction that began in early October. The flagship cryptocurrency is now trading above $90,000, with hopes building for a potential push back toward its all-time high of $126,100. Notably, popular market analyst KillaXBT has flagged a key price zone that could serve as the next target in this relieving market recovery. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Break Key Supply Clusters To Regain ATH Momentum – Watch These Levels Bitcoin Headed To $95k-$96k, But Price Pullback May Occur First – Analyst In an X post on November 28, KillaXBT shares some compelling insights on Bitcoin’s price condition, highlighting both bullish and bearish tendencies. Following the asset’s gain of 7.22% in the past week, the analyst predicts that market bulls are likely to drive prices to around $95,000-$96,000, which contains strong, heavy illiquidity pockets and several liquidation clusters. For context, these zones are attractive to price because they contain large concentrations of resting orders, making them high-value liquidity targets. Liquidation clusters, in particular, hold groups of leveraged positions that trigger forced buying or selling once the price reaches them, injecting fresh liquidity into the market. However, KillaXBT cautions that this upside move may not occur immediately, noting that the market often delays sweeping major liquidity zones ahead of key macro events. With the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting expected to deliver clarity on potential rate cuts, traders may see continued liquidity building below the yearly open in the near term. According to the analyst, these upper liquidation levels are still likely to be cleared, but the timing could align more closely with next month’s policy announcement rather than the current market cycle. The analyst outlines a potential scenario in which Bitcoin experiences a minor pullback to around $93,000 before retesting $89,200. From there, the asset could move toward the $95,000–$96,000 target, in line with expectations for a potential FOMC rate adjustment. However, KillaXBT also highlights the possibility that Bitcoin may reach these key liquidation zones before the FOMC meeting. In such a scenario, the market could see a rapid surge to $96,000, followed by a sharp drop to around $89,200 due to potential liquidations, before eventually returning to these upper liquidity zones. Following this analysis, KillaXBT is opting for a short position, which he intends to reassess in relation to market trends as the FOMC approaches. Interestingly, the analyst believes the real short-term opportunity only comes after the FOMC’s announcement. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Loss Transfers Fall 80% From Peak – What Comes Next?

    "title": "Ethereum Leverage Reset Complete – Time For Market Re-Accumulation?",
    "body": "Ethereum presently trades around $3,000 following a broader crypto market rebound in the last week. During this time, the market’s largest altcoin gained by 7.22%, providing a much-needed relief after an extended correction that dominated the majority of the last two months. As price stabilizes, crypto analytics platform XWIN Research Japan shares a forward-looking assessment of Ethereum’s outlook, especially considering developments in the futures market. Related Reading: 320 Ether On The Move: Bhutan Ramps Up Its Staking Game Ethereum Bulls Buy The Dip After Weak Position Exits Amid the widespread correction of the crypto market in Q4 2025, Ethereum’s prices crashed from $4,700 to as low as $2,900, representing a 38% price decline. XWIN Research Japan reports this price fall coincided with certain relevant developments in the futures market. In particular, Ethereum’s open interest across all exchanges dropped from $21 billion to around $17 billion in late November, as overleveraged long positions were closed down, forcing traders to open new positions with moderate leverage size. Meanwhile, funding rates stayed positive but declined to around 0.002, meaning that the dominant bullish sentiment from mid-2025 greatly reduced. Looking at on-chain data, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) is at 1.27, while Binance data shows it to be around 1.0, both values indicating Ethereum is in a neutral to fair value zone, suggesting a period of stability before the next major trend emerges. Meanwhile, the recent market recovery kick-started after ETH retested the realized price of whale addresses, indicating that large market players are bolstering their holdings. XWIN Research Japan supports this theory, noting that Ethereum Treasury BitMine has boosted its market holdings to 3.63 million ETH. Additionally, a BlackRock client recently acquired tens of millions of dollars’ worth of ETH, further reinforcing the strength of current market demand. However, despite this robust market demand, ETH Spot ETF net outflows for November hit $1.42 billion, indicating there is significant selling pressure in the market.

Despite its gains in the last week, the altcoin is still down by 22.34% over the last month, suggesting the majority of short-term holders are in losses. XWIN Research Japan explains that although the overleveraged position has been cleared out with market whales now ramping up their holding, Ethereum remains in a “bottom-building phase”. Therefore, investors should still anticipate a “choppy, sell-on-rally” price action in the short term. The analysts predict a major trend reversal with time as the current price area becomes increasingly attractive to investors for massive accumulation opportunities.

    "title": "Bitcoin Miner Behavior Confirms Local Bottom Formation At $80,000 – Details",
    "body": "The Bitcoin (BTC) market continues to stabilize around $90,000 following a significant price recovery in the last week. Before these recent gains, the maiden cryptocurrency had undergone a heavy market correction, dropping about 36.10% from its all-time high of around $126,100. Amid the ongoing consolidation, the latest data on Bitcoin miner activity suggests the asset may have hit a local bottom with sights now set on a sustained uptrend. Notably, market analyst BorisD shares on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform an insight that suggests Bitcoin likely formed a local bottom as it dipped to $80,000 during its recent correction phase. The expert explains that this theory is confirmed by Bitcoin miners recording an underpaid status, which has historically been a strong signal in confirming a local market bottom. For context, Bitcoin miners become underpaid when the mining revenue, i.e., block rewards + fees, falls below miners’ average operating costs, resulting in financial stress, forced selling, and capitulation of certain miners, possibly due to bankruptcy. Related Reading: Analyst Sets Bitcoin Next Target At $95k-$96k – Here’s Why Bitcoin Miners’ Economics In Influencing Market Ends BorisD explains that Bitcoin miner profitability has been a consistent guiding metric in determining potential market tops or bottoms. For example, miner revenue in early 2024 reached intensely high levels as prices rallied strongly. This condition, created by a rise in transaction fees and block dollar value, allowed miners to become profitable to distribute supply to the market, thereby aligning early topping structures. By mid-2024, the market had created a pattern where capitulation zones often indicated local bottoms, and severely overpaid zones matched market tops with heavy liquidity outflows. Notably, this pattern held throughout late 2024, early and mid 2025, during which miners’ revenue alternated between the overpaid and underpaid zone. As Bitcoin’s price struggled in Q4 2025, falling to around $80,000, BorisD explains that miners experienced another deep underpaid regime that completed a capitulation cycle, exhaustion of miner-driven selling pressure, but most importantly, confirmation of price local bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s November Slump Could Trigger A 2026 Revival, Analysts Say Bitcoin Market Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $90,898 after a minor 0.64% gain in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is down 36.32% to $38.77 billion. According to BorisD, Bitcoin miners’ profitability is expected to continue improving, provided the market price stays above $80,000. This dynamic, in turn, supports a continuation of upward price momentum, potentially pushing Bitcoin toward another market top. Although the present market cycle has displayed atypical behavior compared to previous ones, analysts remain broadly optimistic. Many expect Bitcoin not only to recover but to eventually surpass its prior six-figure valuation. Featured image from Investopedia, chart from Tradingview",

    "title": "XRP Price At A Critical Turning Point: Analyst Maps Out Simple Rules For Breakout",
    "body": "The monthly XRP chart has entered one of its most decisive phases in years, and one of the asset’s most vocal analysts is laying out a blunt roadmap. Egrag Crypto, known for his long-standing bullish stance on XRP, released a new technical update that breaks down the future outlook for the cryptocurrency into three straightforward outcomes. The chart accompanying his analysis shows XRP trading around the $2.20 region, sitting just above an important Fib support level but still wrestling with momentum, with the monthly candle about to close. Related Reading: 320 Ether On The Move: Bhutan Ramps Up Its Staking Game XRP Must Close Above $2.60 To Keep Bullish Momentum Intact Egrag’s first decisive level is at $2.60, which matches with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level on the monthly chart. The analyst described a close above this region as bullish but the asset would not yet be fully clear of danger. The chart shows XRP repeatedly testing this price level in the first half of the year before breaking above it in July. However, the most recent breakdown in Q2 2025 has now put the price level in focus again. The analysis becomes more aggressive once price action breaks above $3.40. EGRAG identified this as the 0.888 Fibonacci level, one of the final retracement zones. According to him, a close above this level confirms a super-bullish macro breakout, which he summarized with the phrase “we are so back.” The chart reinforces this idea by showing a tight compression beneath this upper 0.888 Fib cluster, and that a decisive breakout could lead to a rapid move into new all-time high prices if there’s enough buying pressure. XRP Price Chart. Source: @egragcrypto On X A Close Below 21 EMA Would Break Bullish Structure The downside scenario in Egrag’s breakdown is equally straightforward. He warned that a close below the 21-month EMA would mean a severe failure of the bullish trend structure. His wording was intentionally harsh, noting that such a breakdown would mean “we are f**ked, no sugar-coating it.” The chart shows the 21 EMA currently sitting around the $1.83-$1.90 price zone, forming the final major support on the monthly timeframe. Losing this level would drag XRP back into a deeper corrective zone and finally undo most of the price advancement made this year. A significant development showed up towards the end of the week that aligns with the bullish continuation Egrag outlined. 21Shares confirmed that its US Spot XRP ETF, which is listed under the ticker TOXR, has received SEC approval and will officially launch on Monday. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s November Slump Could Trigger A 2026 Revival, Analysts Say The upcoming launch adds a perspective that institutional participation in XRP is only beginning. If inflows follow the early strength seen from other issuers, the ETFs could reinforce the bullish case Egrag mapped on the chart, especially if the XRP price is able to cross above $2.60 in December.

    "title": "Bitcoin Miners Face A Harsh December: Rising BTC Difficulty, Falling Hashprice",
    "body": "According to CoinWarz, the next difficulty adjustment is expected at block 927,360, moving the target from 149 trillion to close to 150 trillion. That is a modest rise, but it matters because Bitcoin miners are already working with very thin margins. Hashpower is strong enough to push difficulty up even while returns stay near record lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s November Slump Could Trigger A 2026 Revival, Analysts Say Hashprice Sits Near Break-Even Hashrate Index data shows hashprice is hovering around $38.3 PH/s per day, a touch up from a recent trough below $35 PH/s on November 21. Reports indicate that $40 PH/s is roughly the break-even level for many operations. When revenue per petahash drifts under that mark, some miners face a hard choice as they usher in December: switch off rigs or keep paying to mine. Average block times have been close to the 10-minute goal, with the network recently averaging about 9.97 minutes, which helped trigger the most recent adjustment that dropped difficulty from 152.2 trillion to 149.3 trillion. Hardware, Politics And Supply Risks Reports have disclosed a US Department of Homeland Security probe into Bitmain, the China-based ASIC maker, over concerns its machines could be accessed remotely. Bitmain is reported to control about 80% of the ASIC market, according to the University of Cambridge. That market concentration leaves the industry vulnerable. If US officials impose restrictions, tariffs, or other limits, miners could face higher hardware costs and slower deliveries. Some equipment orders might be delayed or rerouted, and expansion plans would be tested. China Unlikely To End Bitcoin Mining Ban Despite Uptick Meanwhile, overseas, a mild uptick in China’s bitcoin mining has led some scholars to urge Beijing to relax its ban so miners can use excess energy, but experts say a formal reversal is unlikely. Related Reading: 320 Ether On The Move: Bhutan Ramps Up Its Staking Game According to Hashrate Index, China’s share of global hash rate rose from 13.75% in Q1 2025 to 14% in the current quarter, placing it third behind the US and Russia. Historical data from the Cambridge index shows China’s hash rate fell to zero in July 2021 before unofficial activity pushed it back to 22.29% by September 2021; Cambridge stopped updating its mining map in February 2022. Beijing has tightened rules on crypto in recent years, arguing such activity disrupts financial order and can enable illegal behavior. Experts believe those political and policy concerns make an official lift of the mining ban unlikely, despite the recent rise in activity. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Monad Price To Crash 99%? BitMEX Co-Founder Calls Protocol Another Berachain",
    "body": "The Layer 1 blockchain Monad has grabbed the headlines in the past few days following its successful launch earlier last week. MON, its native token, enjoyed a significant 80% surge on the back of the launch, hitting an all-time high of 0.048 on Wednesday, November 26. While the Monad protocol has enjoyed significant attention since going live, it appears that not everyone is confident in its potential adoption. Most notably, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has put forward a pessimistic outlook for the project, saying its token value could fall as much as 99%. Monad Has No Real Use Case: Hayes In a YouTube interview with Altcoin Daily, Hayes stated that any other Layer 1 blockchain besides Ethereum and Solana is “zero” and is not going to do very well. Using Monad as an example, the former BitMEX CEO described the protocol’s coin as another “high FDV, low-float” token. Related Reading: Solana Braces For A Dual-Test Setup – Here’s What Could Happen Next Hayes said that Monad is going to be the new “Berachain” and expects its native token’s value to fall by 99% after the initial jump. Berachain, which launched in February 2025, has its native token BERA trading beneath $1, nearly 94% beneath its all-time high of $14.83. As of this writing, the Monad token is valued at around $0.0285, reflecting an over 40% decline since hitting its all-time high on Wednesday. Hayes highlighted that every new project’s token often enjoys an early price spike before facing a deep correction, as there is usually no real use case to back up the initial growth. The crypto founder noted that it is a classic case of FOMO (fear of missing out), especially after the massive success of Ethereum. Hayes said in the interview: Every coin gets their first pump and people want to believe in the new L1. Everybody wants to invest in the new Ethereum like they would have in 2014 when everyone missed it. Me included. But again, that doesn’t mean it [Monad] is going to actually have any real use case. Moving forward, Hayes went on to pick a “magnificent five” of protocols currently in the cryptocurrency space, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, ZCash, and Ethena. If Not Layer 1s, What Next? It is little surprise that ZCash made it to the BitMEX co-founder’s list of top blockchain protocols. According to Hayes, ZCash and other privacy-focused coins—like Monero—will dominate the crypto narrative even more in the coming year.

Specifically, the crypto founder noted that the next winner in the crypto market over the next one to two years would come from the ZK space. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "BlackRock Exec Says Bitcoin ETFs Becoming A Major Revenue Source Was A ‘Big Surprise’",
    "body": "Spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are one of the biggest narratives and have been a game-changer in the cryptocurrency space in the past two years. With these investment products, people get to participate in the cryptocurrency market without having to directly own the digital assets. Interestingly, one of the biggest winners—that often gets overlooked—has been the issuers, especially as the crypto industry has seen increased institutional adoption since the Bitcoin ETFs launched. According to the firm’s executive, the BTC exchange-traded funds becoming the major source of revenue for BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was not envisioned. BlackRock’s Bitcoin Funds Outweighing Expectations At the Blockchain Conference 2025 in São Paulo on Friday, November 28, BlackRock’s business development director in Brazil, Cristiano Castro, told reporters that the Bitcoin ETFs are the largest revenue source for their company. According to the executive, this development came as a “big surprise” to the asset management firm.

Castro said in a statement: We were very optimistic when we launched, but we didn’t believe it would reach such proportions. Just to give you an idea, it [IBIT in the US and IBIT39 in Brazil – the asset’s reference names] came very close to US$100 billion [in allocation]. This feat is notable for the Bitcoin ETFs, especially considering that BlackRock offers more than 1,400 exchange-traded products globally and has a whopping $13.4 trillion in assets under management. The US-based Bitcoin fund (with the IBIT ticker) has over $70.7 billion in net assets, becoming the first ETF to reach the $70-billion mark (doing so in June 2025). While the US Bitcoin ETF market has somewhat slowed down, BlackRock’s IBIT still continues to outpace other ETFs launched in recent years. As earlier reports suggested, IBIT had managed to generate roughly $245 million in annual fees as of October 2025. Bitcoin ETF Outflows ‘Perfectly Normal’ – Castro When asked about the recent outflows from BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF as the market leader’s value fell, the director stated that there are zero surprises in that trend. “ETFs are very liquid and powerful instruments, and they serve precisely to allow people to allocate their capital and manage their cash flow,” Castro noted. The BlackRock director said that the withdrawals are expected, considering that the product is heavily owned by retail investors, who are reactionary in nature to price corrections. On Friday, the iShares Bitcoin Trust saw a net outflow of $113.72 million, bringing the weekly record to a negative $137.01 million and the fund to its fifth-consecutive week of withdrawals.
