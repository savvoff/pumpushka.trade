    "title": "XRP Set To Lead The Next Bull Rally: Crypto Research Firm Blows The Lid Open",
    "body": "XRP is once again making headlines after a top crypto research firm issued a bold forecast, declaring it “the fastest horse” on the next bull market rally. The statement has reignited enthusiasm across the XRP community, with many investors and traders agreeing despite the token’s history of volatility and past declines. Sistine Research Sees Major Shift For XRP Market analysis platform Sistine Research has shared its outlook on X social media, saying XRP is the best-looking major digital asset in the current market cycle. The firm described XRP as the fastest mover following recent government developments that are expected to reshape the interaction between digital assets and traditional finance. Related Reading: Why Did The Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Crash On October 10 And Will It Happen Again? Sistine Research believes that several upcoming events could heavily favour XRP in the long run. Among them are a potential banking charter approval for Ripple, the introduction of the CLARITY Act, and the possibility of XRP Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). The research firm has revealed that these key developments would give Ripple a stronger foothold in global finance and expand XRP’s use case in payments and banking. In a subsequent post, Sistine Research went even further, suggesting that Ripple could soon become a fully licensed bank. The post warned that some people might downplay this milestone, but emphasized that it would be a very bullish sign for the XRP price. Such recognition and the ensuing adoption could make XRP one of the first digital assets, other than stablecoins, deeply connected to global banking infrastructure, setting it apart from other major cryptocurrencies. Notably, Sistine Research’s outlook on XRP aligns with Ripple’s long-term vision of bridging the gap between blockchain technology and traditional finance through the use of digital assets. With regulatory clarity achieved following the resolution of its legal battle with the US SEC, XRP now faces fewer obstacles to growth and development as it continues to solidify its role in the rapidly evolving crypto and financial landscape. Analyst Charts XRP’s Bullish Path To $2.7 The price of XRP is currently at $2.5, having experienced a slight recovery after weeks of choppy action and volatility. Crypto analyst Kamran Asghar has reinforced his optimistic forecast with his latest technical breakdown on X. He noted that XRP has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern and surged to about $2.5. Related Reading: Here Are The Bitcoin Whales That Have Been Dumping BTC And Crashing The Price He described this as a strong move that suggests that the cryptocurrency is “reloading” for the next phase of its bull rally. According to Asghar’s TradingView chart, the key support zone lies near $2.35. He expects a short pullback to that level before another leg higher. This implies that XRP could see a temporary 6% decline from current levels. Subsequently, if support holds, Asghar predicts a confirmed rally toward $2.7, representing an almost 15% price increase and marking the next resistance area for XRP.

    "title": "Top Crypto Presales to Watch as Coinbase Launches Its New Token Sale Platform",
    "body": "What to Know: Coinbase’s new token-sale platform brings retail traders back into early-stage crypto deals, offering one curated sale each month with USDC settlement, starting with Monad. Bitcoin Hyper connects fast transaction execution with Bitcoin’s secure settlement layer, a solid concept if BTC-linked activity continues to grow after the ETF boom. Maxi Doge combines meme-driven branding with dynamic staking and an accessible entry price of $0.0002675, classic ingredients for early-stage community momentum. Remittix targets real-world remittances through crypto-to-fiat payouts in 30+ currencies, with presale raising over $28M. Coinbase just made presales mainstream again. The exchange unveiled a platform that lets everyday users buy new tokens before they list on Coinbase, reviving a funding model retail hasn’t touched at scale since the 2017-2018 ICO era. The product targets one offering per month with algorithmic allocations and USDC settlement, positioning Coinbase at the center of primary issuance. Early access isn’t just for whales and private rounds anymore. Retail can finally get a clean, compliance-wrapped route into vetted sales. The debut sale features Monad and Coinbase, which will gate participation with registration and a one-week order window, aiming to curb the chaos that defined last cycle’s launches. For traders tracking the best crypto presales narrative, attention is rotating toward projects with clear utility, credible teams, and visible investor demand. In that slipstream, three names stand out at different points on the utility–hype spectrum: a $BTC-aligned L2 ( Bitcoin Hyper ), a meme-forward community play ( Maxi Doge ), and a payments rail aiming at real-world remittances (Remittix). Each has momentum that could benefit if Coinbase’s distribution funnel reignites presale appetite. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – BTC-Aligned L2 Built for Throughput Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has a straightforward pitch: make $BTC move at app speed without severing Bitcoin’s settlement guarantees. Public materials outline a rollup-style architecture powered by a Solana Virtual Machine execution layer that batches transactions and commits state back to Bitcoin, an approach designed to serve payments, DeFi, and dApps with near-instant finality. The presale shows strong momentum, positioning $HYPER as a potential beneficiary of renewed attention on Bitcoin scalability as ETF flows deepen. On the numbers, participation looks sticky. Cumulative commitments are over $26.8M, and you can buy $HYPER for $0.013255 right now. That matters because crypto presales thrive when big tickets can enter without slippage. The utility loop is clear: $HYPER is designed for fees, governance, and staking, with multi-chain bridges in the works to ease onboarding from ETH and SOL. If Coinbase’s token-sale venue funnels more retail into infrastructure narratives, a $BTC-settled L2 that can host meme flows and payments has a clean runway. Join the $HYPER presale now. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Meme-First Brand With Live Staking and Community Flywheels Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is the meme coin embracing ‘simple brand, sticky incentives’. The project leans on an assertive Doge aesthetic, fixed supply, and a live staking module designed to lengthen holding periods during the presale. The official site highlights dynamic APY (variable over time) and a structure geared for DEX liquidity at launch. The presale has already raised over $3.9M and you can buy $MAXI for just $0.0002675. That’s textbook meme mechanics: convert culture into commitment, then use staking to smooth the path between presale stages. When a regulated venue puts presales back in headlines, community-heavy projects with low unit prices tend to attract first-wave retail. $MAXI’s roadmap nods to contests and strategy sharing, features that help maintain high engagement when the broader market cools. It’s still high risk, as with any meme, but the combination of distribution, staking, and clear branding gives $MAXI a chance to capture spillover interest from Coinbase’s new funnel. Stake and secure $MAXI today. 3. Remittix ($RTX) – PayFi Presale Targeting Crypto-to-Bank Transfers Remittix ($RTX) is a payments platform designed for real-world transactions: send crypto and have it settled as fiat in bank accounts across 30+ currencies via local rails. The project positions itself as a ‘PayFi’ network that hides crypto complexity, flat fees, no FX add-ons, and same-day processing. Remittix uses multi-chain rails – Ethereum for contracts and Solana for speed, and offers a wallet that bridges on-chain funds to fiat payouts, aligning with the real-world remittance use case regulators favor. The project has raised over $28M as the presale advances. And right now, you can get $RTX for $0.1166. If retail can buy curated tokens prior to listing, payment-utility stories with tangible user value stand to benefit. The current presale structure maintains accessibility, while the focus on cross-border payouts with predictable fees lends the project a strong fundamental foundation beyond hype. Should the wallet’s bank-payout flow perform as advertised, $RTX could see a smoother handoff from presale to exchange liquidity. Check out the $RTX presale now. Coinbase’s early-access platform puts vetted token sales back in front of retail. For traders scanning the best crypto presales today, Bitcoin Hyper , Maxi Doge , and Remittix offer three distinct paths: Bitcoin-aligned throughput, a meme-driven community with staking, and a payments rail aimed at crypto-to-bank transfers.

    "title": "Uniswap Price Could ‘Go Parabolic’ Due To Supply Shock, Says CryptoQuant CEO",
    "body": "Uniswap (UNI) ripped higher on Tuesday after Uniswap Labs founder Hayden Adams unveiled “UNIfication,” a sweeping governance proposal that would activate protocol fees and route them into coordinated token burns. The structural shift—combined with a sharp change in how Uniswap’s teams are organized, igniting an extremely bullish sentiment, with CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju arguing that a real supply shock could be incoming. Uniswap (UNI) Supply Shock Incoming? “Uniswap could go parabolic if the fee switch is activated. Even just counting v2 and v3, with $1T in YTD volume, that’s about $500M in annual burns if volume holds. Exchanges hold $830M, so even with unlocks, a supply shock seems inevitable. Correct me if I’m wrong,” Ki Young Ju wrote. In a thread posted early Tuesday, Adams said he was “incredibly excited to make my first proposal to Uniswap governance,” describing a framework that “turns on protocol fees and aligns incentives across the Uniswap ecosystem.” He framed the move as the culmination of years of legal wrangling that had constrained Labs’ role: “UNI launched in 2020, but for the past 5 years Labs has been unable to meaningfully participate in Uniswap governance That ends today,” he wrote, adding that “the regulatory environment has shifted.” Related Reading: Binance Whales Turn Active On Uniswap As Outflows Hit Multi-Month Highs – Details The on-chain economics he outlined are unambiguous. Protocol usage would begin burning UNI; Unichain sequencer revenue would be directed to the same burn sink; and the treasury would immediately destroy 100 million UNI to account for fees that “could have been burned if fees were turned on at token launch.” Adams also described new “protocol fee discount auctions” to improve LP outcomes and internalize MEV, and an “aggregator hooks” architecture in v4 that would let the protocol capture fees sourced from external liquidity. In parallel, Uniswap Labs would stop charging fees on its interface, wallet, and API to push distribution and adoption, while Uniswap Foundation staff move to Labs under a growth mandate funded by the treasury. The net effect is a consolidation: Uniswap’s development, growth and fee policy would be operated under a single, explicitly token-aligned structure, with governance retaining control. Price action reflected Ki Young Ju’s comment. UNI spiked to multi-week highs as coverage spread. In early European trading hours, UNI showed a one-day gain near 30% while many majors treaded water, underscoring UNI’s idiosyncratic governance-driven rally. Beyond headline burns, the crux is whether the economic flywheel can be sustained without degrading liquidity provider economics. Historically, Uniswap governance has wrestled with “fee switch” design trade-offs and the risk of disintermediating LPs or pushing order flow elsewhere. Related Reading: Samourai Wallet Co-Founder Sentenced To 5 Years In Prison For Money Laundering Adams argued this blueprint is different because fee proceeds are not distributed as passive yield but are instead destroyed to concentrate value into the remaining float, while discount auctions and MEV internalization are meant to keep LPs competitive on net execution. The full rationale and parameterization—fee rates, split between pools, cadence for auctions, and the exact mechanics of the burn—are laid out in the governance post now in “Requests for Comment,” with implementation subject to the usual forum review and on-chain governance process. Adams cast the proposal as an existential scaling step: “I believe Uniswap protocol can be the primary place tokens are traded. This proposal sets the stage for the next decade of its growth […] Uniswap will ship relentlessly over the coming years and supercharge the ecosystem of developers, LPs, and traders,” he wrote. According to estimates by MegaETH Labs member BREAD, if Uniswap were to modify its standard 0.3% trading fee so that 0.25% is allocated to liquidity providers and 0.05% directed toward UNI buybacks, the protocol could channel roughly $38 million into monthly repurchases. This projection is based on an annualized fee revenue of approximately $2.8 billion and would position Uniswap’s buyback capacity slightly above PUMP’s $35 million pace, yet still below HYPE’s $95 million benchmark. At press time, UNI traded at $8.609. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Analyst Says Don’t Get Left Behind As Massive Liquidity Wave Is Coming For XRP",
    "body": "A crypto analyst known as Pumpius has issued a bold warning on social media platform X, declaring that a massive liquidity wave is about to sweep through global markets, and XRP could be the key asset positioned to capture it. His post, shared alongside a chart of the US national debt now above $38 trillion, argues that a combination of government stimulus, monetary easing, and corporate spending is about to unleash a surge of capital unlike anything seen since the 2020 pandemic. Liquidity Flood And The Return Of Stimulus Spending In his analysis, Pumpius highlighted that the United States government is preparing to inject over $400 billion in new stimulus payments, and this is going to be the first direct round of such spending since 2021. This comes at a time when the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates despite inflation still sitting above 3% and labor market data showing signs of cooling. Related Reading: XRP Price To Reach $1,000 By End Of 2025? Rumor Mills Are On Fire With BlackRock Speculations A similar setup in 2020 and 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic led to an enormous wave of liquidity that lifted both traditional and crypto markets to record highs. Now, President Donald Trump has vowed to provide each American a $2,000 dividend to be distributed from what he said was tariff revenue. The chart shown below illustrates a notable connection vividly: each major stimulus injection, from the $270 billion to $410 billion rounds, coincided with sharp jumps in the national debt and subsequent market expansions. With total US debt now projected to exceed $38 trillion, Pumpius believes another round of liquidity growth is close. The analyst went on to point out that this time, the liquidity wave is not just based on government spending but also on private-sector investment on an extraordinary scale. The so-called Magnificent 7 technology companies (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla) are collectively pouring over $100 billion every quarter into artificial intelligence infrastructure. XRP Positioned As The Bridge For Global Capital Flow According to Pumpius, all this incoming liquidity needs a bridge, an asset capable of settling large-value transactions instantly across borders. He described XRP as the only digital asset designed precisely for this purpose, built for institutional-grade, real-time settlement and capable of handling global capital flows efficiently. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Decouple From Bitcoin, Here’s What Would Happen Ripple’s technology already provides the financial infrastructure necessary to connect banks, fintechs, and payment systems that will need to move funds quickly as liquidity expands. “The math is simple,” he said. “The liquidity is coming. The rails are ready. Own XRP or be left behind,” he concluded. XRP is one of the top-traded digital assets by volume, and market participants are watching closely to see how the cryptocurrency’s price action plays out. Ripple, its parent technology company, has been making different partnership moves and company acquisitions to expand its reach. This is expected to hopefully boost XRP’s adoption on a global scale and, in turn, its price growth. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.45, down by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

    "body": "ZEC has entered a sharp correction phase after a 1,500% rally that pushed the Zcash price to a seven-year high of nearly $744. The coin, which became the top-performing privacy asset in 2025, is now down over 25% from its all-time high as traders question whether its parabolic uptrend has finally peaked. Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bottom In? Analyst Explains What Matters Now According to data from TradingView, ZEC began its meteoric rise in early September, breaking through long-term resistance levels at $400. However, analysts now warn that the asset may have reached its cyclical top. Popular trader Altcoin Sherpa cautioned that such steep, prolonged rallies often “end with a sharp and painful collapse.” Similarly, technical indicators show ZEC’s RSI recently hit 94.2, an extreme overbought reading last seen during its 2017–2018 boom. ZEC's price records sharp losses on the daily chart. Source: ZECUSD on Tradingview Analysts Warn of Deep Pullback Toward $300–$400 Range Multiple market observers expect a deeper correction in the weeks ahead. Trader Greeny noted that Zcash’s current rally is “the longest in its history” and could mirror previous cycles that ended with 45%–90% drawdowns. On the daily chart, ZEC appears trapped within a corrective channel, suggesting further downside unless strong support emerges around the $400 zone. Still, not all analysts are bearish. Technical analyst Valdrin Tahiri emphasized that ZEC’s MACD and RSI indicators, although overbought, exhibit no bearish divergence, suggesting that the pullback may be a temporary correction rather than the beginning of a prolonged downtrend. If bulls manage to defend the $400 level, the coin could stabilize before resuming its broader bullish structure. Arthur Hayes Sees Long-Term Upside Amid Fiscal Expansion Adding intrigue to the ongoing correction, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes recently reaffirmed his bullish stance on Zcash, predicting that both BTC and ZEC could benefit from renewed U.S. fiscal stimulus. Hayes argues that as government liquidity increases, privacy coins like Zcash stand to gain as investors seek decentralized and censorship-resistant assets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Does Not Have Potential For A Strong Move Upward, Analyst Says While short-term volatility dominates the charts, long-term holders remain confident. Zcash’s advanced zk-SNARKs technology continues to position it as a key player in privacy innovation, and if fiscal easing drives another liquidity wave, ZEC could yet stage a remarkable comeback.

    "body": "XRP is once again making headlines after a top crypto research firm issued a bold forecast, declaring it “the fastest horse” on the next bull market rally. The statement has reignited enthusiasm across the XRP community, with many investors and traders agreeing despite the token’s history of volatility and past declines. Sistine Research Sees Major Shift For XRP Market analysis platform Sistine Research has shared its outlook on X social media, saying XRP is the best-looking major digital asset in the current market cycle. The firm described XRP as the fastest mover following recent government developments that are expected to reshape the interaction between digital assets and traditional finance. Related Reading: Analyst Says 300% XRP Price Rally To $10 Is Fair, Here’s Why Sistine Research believes that several upcoming events could heavily favour XRP in the long run. Among them are a potential banking charter approval for Ripple, the introduction of the CLARITY Act, and the possibility of XRP Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). The research firm has revealed that these key developments would give Ripple a stronger foothold in global finance and expand XRP’s use case in payments and banking. In a subsequent post, Sistine Research went even further, suggesting that Ripple could soon become a fully licensed bank. The post warned that some people might downplay this milestone, but emphasized that it would be a very bullish sign for the XRP price. Such recognition and the ensuing adoption could make XRP one of the first digital assets, other than stablecoins, deeply connected to global banking infrastructure, setting it apart from other major cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Rare Chart Formation That Led To An 87% XRP Price Crash Has Resurfaced Notably, Sistine Research’s outlook on XRP aligns with Ripple’s long-term vision of bridging the gap between blockchain technology and traditional finance through the use of digital assets. With regulatory clarity achieved following the resolution of its legal battle with the US SEC, XRP now faces fewer obstacles to growth and development as it continues to solidify its role in the rapidly evolving crypto and financial landscape. Analyst Charts XRP’s Bullish Path To $2.7 The price of XRP is currently at $2.5, having experienced a slight recovery after weeks of choppy action and volatility. Crypto analyst Kamran Asghar has reinforced his optimistic forecast with his latest technical breakdown on X. He noted that XRP has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern and surged to about $2.5. He described this as a strong move that suggests that the cryptocurrency is “reloading” for the next phase of its bull rally. According to Asghar’s TradingView chart, the key support zone lies near $2.35. He expects a short pullback to that level before another leg higher. This implies that XRP could see a temporary 6% decline from current levels. Subsequently, if support holds, Asghar predicts a confirmed rally toward $2.7, representing an almost 15% price increase and marking the next resistance area for XRP.

    "title": "Uniswap Founder Submits Governance Proposal To Burn UNI — Token Jumps 50%",
    "body": "Uniswap is once again making headlines in the DeFi sector after Hayden Adams, founder and CEO of Uniswap Labs, announced a major governance proposal to activate protocol fees and align incentives across the Uniswap ecosystem. The announcement sent shockwaves through the market, with UNI’s price surging more than 50% in the hours following the news — reflecting renewed optimism among investors and traders. Related Reading: Anti-CZ Whale Flips Bullish On Ethereum: Now Up $15M On A $119.6M Long Position In a post shared on X, Adams reflected on Uniswap’s evolution: “Uniswap has been my passion and singular focus for the past 8 years. What started as a small side project is now global financial infrastructure powering thousands of applications with ~$1.8 trillion in annual trading.” Since UNI’s launch in 2020, Uniswap Labs has been largely unable to meaningfully participate in governance, constrained by regulatory pressures that Adams said cost “thousands of hours and tens of millions in legal fees.” Now, with the regulatory environment shifting, those limitations appear to be easing. Inside Hayden Adams’ Vision to Reshape Uniswap’s Future In his new governance proposal, Uniswap founder Hayden Adams outlined a sweeping plan to overhaul how the protocol operates, distributes value, and aligns incentives across its ecosystem. “At a high level,” Adams explained, the proposal seeks to activate protocol fees and direct them toward UNI burns, creating a sustainable mechanism for value accrual. The plan also includes sending Unichain sequencer fees to the UNI burn, further tightening the token’s supply, and burning 100 million UNI from the treasury, representing the fees that could have been burned if the mechanism had been active since launch. Another major component introduces Protocol Fee Discount Auctions, a new feature designed to improve liquidity provider (LP) outcomes and capture MEV (miner extractable value) directly for the protocol. Adams also proposes “aggregator hooks” for Uniswap v4, turning it into an on-chain aggregator capable of collecting fees from external liquidity sources — a move that could expand Uniswap’s reach across the DeFi ecosystem. Beyond these technical changes, the proposal redefines the role of Uniswap Labs, directing it to focus exclusively on protocol growth and governance-aligned initiatives, while ending fee collection on its interface, wallet, and API to encourage wider adoption. Finally, the plan would merge Foundation employees into Labs under a new growth fund and move governance-owned Unisocks liquidity to v4 on Unichain, where it would be burned. However, not everyone sees this as purely bullish. Some analysts argue the move reflects growing pressure from rivals like Aerodrome Finance, whose rapid ecosystem expansion has drawn liquidity away from Uniswap. From this perspective, the proposal may represent both a bold strategic pivot and a defensive play to reassert Uniswap’s dominance in a fast-evolving DeFi landscape. Related Reading: Ethereum Trading Volume On Binance Surpasses $6 Trillion: A Speculative Frenzy Unfolds UNI Price Analysis: Massive Breakout Follows Governance Proposal Uniswap’s native token, UNI, posted a powerful rebound following Hayden Adams’ governance proposal, with price action reflecting a decisive change in sentiment. As seen on the 3-day chart, UNI surged nearly +50%, climbing from around $5.80 to a local high above $10.30 before stabilizing near $8.20 at the time of writing. The spike came alongside a sharp rise in trading volume, indicating strong market participation and renewed investor confidence. Technically, UNI’s breakout has reclaimed both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, suggesting a potential shift in momentum after months of bearish consolidation. However, the 200-day moving average near the $9.50–$10.00 zone remains a critical resistance level to watch. A clean break above it could open the door for a continuation toward the $12–$14 range, where UNI last faced heavy distribution.

While the market may see short-term retracement following such a sharp move, the combination of bullish fundamentals and structural recovery on the chart suggests UNI could be entering a new medium-term accumulation phase — with its next trajectory likely tied to community approval of the newly proposed protocol fee activation.

    "body": "Cardano (ADA) has reclaimed major ground in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, with total value locked (TVL) soaring by 28.7% in Q3 2025, the highest level since early 2022. Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bottom In? Analyst Explains What Matters Now According to Messari’s latest State of Cardano report, the network’s DeFi growth and robust treasury expansion have pushed ADA’s market capitalization up 42.5% to $29.5 billion, marking a strong rebound for the ecosystem. ADA's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Core Protocols and Treasury Expansion Fuel Cardano’s Momentum Key protocols like Liqwid and Minswap drove much of Cardano’s DeFi momentum, with Liqwid’s TVL jumping 50.8% to $101.6 million, while Minswap dominated 74.7% of DEX volume. Cardano’s treasury balance also climbed to $1.3 billion, showing renewed developer confidence and ecosystem resilience. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson praised the community’s growing commitment to decentralization, emphasizing that ADA’s ecosystem could expand into “seven or eight digits” in DeFi value if users continue adopting native protocols. Whales Accumulate 348 Million ADA as Price Eyes Recovery Despite recent market instability that dragged ADA below $0.6, whale activity has surged dramatically. On-chain data from Santiment shows that between November 7 and 10, large holders accumulated 348 million ADA, worth over $204 million, representing nearly 0.94% of the total supply. This buying spree has coincided with a modest 21% rebound in ADA’s price from its $0.49 low earlier this month, as investors anticipate a potential breakout above $0.6. Analysts highlight a bullish “Power of Three” pattern forming, which could pave the way for a rally toward $0.73, and possibly higher in the next bullish phase. However, despite whale accumulation, overall network activity has softened slightly, with daily active addresses declining. This divergence suggests that while retail users are cautious, institutional and high-net-worth investors are positioning for long-term gains. Cardano Aligns with ISO 20022 and Expands Roadmap Cardano’s inclusion among digital assets aligned with the ISO 20022 global financial messaging standard has further strengthened its institutional narrative. Charles Hoskinson reaffirmed ADA’s full support for the framework, placing it alongside assets like XRP and XLM in global payment interoperability. In parallel, Cardano achieved full community-led governance in September 2025 and continues to roll out upgrades, such as Halo2-Plutus, which enhance privacy and scalability.

    "title": "Bitcoin STH-MVRV Rebounds From Local Low – Potential Recovery Toward $115K–$120K",
    "body": "Bitcoin has regained footing after a turbulent week of selling pressure, reclaiming crucial support levels and signaling early signs of recovery. Bulls are cautiously stepping back in, though conviction remains limited as the $110K resistance — a key psychological and technical barrier — has yet to be tested. Related Reading: Anti-CZ Whale Flips Bullish On Ethereum: Now Up $15M On A $119.6M Long Position According to CryptoQuant data, underlying market dynamics suggest that a continuation of current momentum could fuel a potential surge toward $115K. The rebound follows a period of heightened liquidations and bearish sentiment that briefly pushed Bitcoin below $100K, triggering panic among short-term traders. On-chain metrics now show improving stability across several fronts. Spot exchange outflows have increased, suggesting that investors are once again moving BTC into self-custody, a sign of renewed holding behavior. At the same time, derivatives market data indicates cooling open interest and reduced leverage — conditions that historically precede healthier, more sustainable uptrends. Short-Term Holder MVRV Suggests Potential for Bitcoin Recovery Top analyst Axel Adler highlights that Bitcoin’s Short-Term Holder (STH) MVRV ratio has shown early signs of recovery following last week’s sharp correction. On November 7, the metric reached a local low of 0.9124, nearing the lower boundary of its historical range — a zone that has often aligned with short-term market bottoms. As of today, the STH MVRV has climbed to 0.9514, signaling that selling pressure among short-term holders may be easing. This stabilization suggests a potential shift from capitulation to recovery, as traders who bought at higher levels begin to reduce loss-taking behavior. Historically, when the STH MVRV holds above 0.92 and begins trending upward, it often precedes a renewed bullish impulse. Adler notes that if this pattern continues, the metric could rise toward the upper boundary of its range, typically associated with price levels between $115K and $120K. This trend aligns with Bitcoin’s recent technical rebound and improving on-chain sentiment. While further confirmation is needed, maintaining the MVRV above this critical threshold could indicate that the market has absorbed much of the short-term selling pressure — laying the groundwork for a potential recovery phase in the weeks ahead.

The daily chart shows a short-term bullish reaction following the bounce from the 200-day moving average (red line) — a critical dynamic support level that has repeatedly marked the bottom of corrective phases throughout this cycle. However, the broader trend remains cautious. The 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages are above the current price, and both are flattening, signaling that momentum remains weak. A decisive breakout above the $108K–$110K resistance zone is needed to confirm a potential trend reversal and shift sentiment.

    "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction Sees $4,000 Next. PepeNode Readies for Rally",
    "body": "What to Know: ETH faces firm resistance at $4,000–$4,100 and could retest the $3,272 support before attempting a breakout toward $4,000. Whales started amassing $ETH in bulk, with one whale in particular reaching $1.38B in $ETH after a recent $213M purchase. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) builds a gamified mine-to-earn loop on Ethereum, aiming to turn presale interest into ongoing activity and token burns. The $PEPENODE presale is now above $2.1M, with a token price of $0.0011454, and rewards early participants with better-performing mining nodes. Ethereum is chopping just below the levels that matter. After repeated knockbacks near $3,700, liquidity still stacks between $4,000 and $4,100, while the bears keep a toehold. Analyst Ted believes that the $4.1K price point is reachable if $ETH maintains momentum above $3.7K. The right conditions seem to be there. Whales and institutions have quietly stepped in, with one whale address scooping $269,460,000-worth of $ETH , while another increased its Ethereum supply to $1.38B, following a $213M purchase . That kind of absorption often caps downside tails and sets the stage for mean-reversion rallies into stacked offers. If $ETH can reclaim $3,700 with conviction, the path toward $4,000 reopens quickly. For context, spot prices hover in the mid-$3Ks with volatility picking up. CoinMarketCap’s live board shows $ETH around the mid-$3,400s today, reminding you the market’s still rangebound and headline-sensitive. Inside that range, the bid keeps showing up at $3,400–$3,300, but $4,000 remains the battleground with thicker resting liquidity. So what do you do if the price chops for a bit longer? This is where risk rotation gets interesting. Periods of $ETH consolidation historically funnel flows toward narratives with clear catalysts. That’s why more eyes drift to early-stage plays aligned with Ethereum’s culture and rails. Enter PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , a ‘mine-to-earn’ meme token building a gamified virtual mining loop on Ethereum. When majors stall but on-chain participation holds, projects that blend gameplay, staking and token burns can soak up attention (and capital) until the next $ETH leg. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): Mine-to-Earn Utility on Ethereum That Rewards Activity PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) positions itself as the meme coin that actually gives you something to do while you wait for the next breakout. Its whitepaper describes a virtual server-room where you buy and slot ‘Miner Nodes’ and facility upgrades, then optimize a simulated hashrate to generate rewards. It’s all on Ethereum, with smart contracts tracking staking and game logic once TGE lands. The concept is simple: create your mining facility, put it to work, and upgrade your nodes whenever necessary. No spicy electricity bills, no massive investments in high-end mining equipment; PEPENODE takes care of that. PEPENODE’s docs outline burn mechanics tied to node purchases and upgrades, alongside staking that switches on during presale and flows into game rewards later. That’s a classic flywheel pitch: more play → more upgrades → more burns → tighter float, assuming adoption sticks. The project incentivizes early adoption, because early nodes deliver higher rewards. Get your ticket into PEPENODE’s ($PEPENODE) mining ecosystem today. PEPENODE, Next Crypto to Explode? The presale is over $2.1M right now with a current token price of $0.0011454, per the project’s live materials. The stage-based pricing means $PEPENODE is guaranteed to increase in value during the presale phase and, if utility checks, post-launch as well. A realistic price prediction for $PEPENODE has the token at $0.0077 by the end of 2026, although massive hype-driven adoption could push it even higher. We’re talking about a 572% ROI if you invest at today’s price. Such a performance would help PEPENODE rank among the best presales of 2025. And possibly one of the next crypto to explode . Where could this go in the broader 2025 setup? The 4-Phase roadmap details several milestones for 2026 and beyond, including launching the Virtual Mining Simulator and introducing the meme coin rewards. For traders watching risk rotations while $ETH wrestles with $3.7K and $4K, the pitch is straightforward: pick spots where the on-chain loop doesn’t grind to a halt just because $BTC and $ETH go sideways. PEPENODE’s ($PEPENODE) mine-to-earn model tries to do exactly that—keeping attention, activity, and token velocity humming until majors decide the next leg. Our guide on how to buy $PEPENODE gives you all the information you need to secure your tokens fast and easy. Go to the presale page and buy your $PEPENODE stack today.

    "title": "Ethereum Ready To Explode To $12,000 By January, Says Tom Lee",
    "body": "Funstrat co-founder Tom Lee says Ethereum could be the crypto market’s near-term leader, targeting a move to $12,000 by January on the back of Wall Street’s tokenization push and rising growth expectations for smart-contract platforms. In an interview released Nov. 10 with Tom Nash, Lee emphasized that while Bitcoin remains under-owned, “there’s a bigger move in Ethereum” over the next several weeks as capital reallocates toward the rails that power stablecoins and tokenized assets. Why Ethereum Is Poised To Rally Soon Lee anchored his call to a blend of technical and fundamental drivers. Citing Funstrat’s head of technical strategy, he noted: “Mark Newton thinks we can be like $9,000 to $12,000 by January. I think that’s about right. I think Ethereum […] more than doubles between now and year end or between now and January.” In parallel, he said Bitcoin could reach the “high $100,000s, maybe even $200,000 by the end of the year,” while reiterating that Ethereum likely has the bigger near-term upside. Related Reading: Ethereum Trading Volume On Binance Surpasses $6 Trillion: A Speculative Frenzy Unfolds The crux of the Ethereum thesis, as Lee laid it out, is that the demand side of crypto is shifting toward applications that depend on smart contracts—precisely the domain where Ethereum is most entrenched. “Even Cathie Wood wrote about it. She thinks stablecoins have been cannibalizing demand for Bitcoin and gold and tokenized gold is cannibalizing demand for Bitcoin. But stablecoins and tokenized gold run on smart contract blockchains like Ethereum,” he said. He added that “Wall Street is building and Larry Fink wants to tokenize everything on the […] blockchain. That means Ethereum is where people are starting to raise their growth expectations.” Lee argued that this change in growth expectations matters as much as, if not more than, headline monetary policy over short windows. While acknowledging that the Federal Reserve remains a critical backdrop, he framed potential December easing as a catalyst for risk assets broadly—financials, small caps, and tech—and, by correlation, crypto. “If they cut in December, they’re confirming they’re on an easing cycle,” he said, calling that “really bullish” for equities most tightly linked to growth and liquidity. In Lee’s framework, those same flows support crypto assets—and Ethereum in particular—into year-end positioning. The fund manager also located the crypto setup within a larger “super-cycle” he’s been mapping for years. He contends that markets are still in the early innings of an AI-driven capex boom and a demographic regime that keeps demand for productive technology elevated. That backdrop, he said, has repeatedly wrong-footed bears who anchored on yield-curve inversions and 1970s inflation analogs. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Critical Resistance — Bullish Breakout Or Trap In The Making? “People have a hard time understanding and grasping super cycles […] we look for story arcs that last 10 to 15 years,” he said, arguing the last three years showcased “mass misconceptions” about recession and persistent inflation that never reconciled with reported earnings. The Macro Backdrop Pressed on risks to the call, Lee downplayed the idea that inflation is about to re-accelerate and argued that oil would need to approach levels near $200 to deliver a true growth shock to US households. “The most overrated risk is that inflation’s coming back,” he said, pointing to cooling housing and labor metrics and stating that recent claims about re-heating core services inflation were “dead wrong” when checked against the PCE series. On policy path-dependence, he suggested that even a December hold by Chair Powell would likely accelerate political pressure for a leadership change, muting the medium-term impact on risk assets. Timing-wise, Lee sees positioning as the near-term accelerant. He argued that institutions remain behind their benchmarks after repeatedly fading rallies through 2023–2025 and that the final weeks of the year often force a chase into outperforming segments. “There is incredible demand for equities because people are really off-sides […] 80% are trailing their benchmark this year […] they’re going to be buying stocks,” he said, adding that the AI trade “is going to come back strong” and that crypto tends to correlate with that move. For Ethereum specifically, Lee’s case reduces to a simple through-line: the pipes getting built are where the next leg of growth accrues. Stablecoins, tokenized gold, and Wall Street’s broader tokenization agenda are traffic that runs on programmable blockchains; the market, in his view, is only beginning to price that through. “If you’re raising your growth expectations, then your discount to the future is going up,” Lee said, explaining why he believes ETH can “have a huge move into year end” and reach the $9,000–$12,000 range by January. At press time, ETH traded at $3,447. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Dominance Has Broken Below 50 EMA, What Happens If It Falls Below 40%?",
    "body": "The Bitcoin dominance has remained quite high over the last year, holding firmly above 50% and preventing altcoins from making any meaningful recovery. Even now, the dominance has climbed close to 60%, showing that Bitcoin is still determining the direction of the entire market. However, there has been a development that could change the trajectory of the Bitcoin dominance and put altcoins in the spotlight once again, highlighted by crypto analyst Unichartz. Bitcoin Dominance Breaks Below 50 EMA Since 2023, the Bitcoin dominance has remained firmly above the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), showing immense strength around this level. Even through market crashes, the digital asset has maintained its dominance, and with each passing year, the trendline has continued to rise. As long as the Bitcoin dominance stayed above the 50 EMA, it showed it would continue to dominate, but this is changing now. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Derivatives Market Is Taking Off Again, But What Does This Mean For Price? According to the post by Unichartz, it shows that the Bitcoin dominance has now crashed below the 50-Day EMA for the first time in almost one year. This comes as the dominance lost its footing above 60% and has failed to reclaim its position above it. Naturally, there has been an attempt to reclaim the 50-Day EMA once again. However, this attempt failed after the brief surge above 63% in early October was thwarted by the market-wide crash on October 10. Since then, the dominance has remained below the 50 EMA and has now spent a full consecutive month below this critical level. What This Means For The Crypto Market Historically, the altcoin season has only begun when the Bitcoin dominance has seen a decline. This trend has held strong through the years, and even through the current cycle, has prevented the rise of another altcoin season. Related Reading: Dogecoin Does Not Have Potential For A Strong Move Upward, Analyst Says However, with the crash below the 50 EMA, the analyst predicts that the Bitcoin dominance is about to see a massive crash. It shows that the dominance will fall below 40% if it fails to reclaim the 50 EMA soon. Such a crash would give room for altcoins to actually run as the focus moves away from Bitcoin. With the Altcoin Season Index sitting at a low 31 at the time of this writing, it shows that a crash in the Bitcoin dominance is sorely needed for altcoins to rise again. However, the analyst explains that if the dominance does reclaim the 50 EMA, then Bitcoin’s lead may be extended for longer before attention rotates back to altcoin.

    "title": "China’s Cybersecurity Agency Alleges US Government Stole $13 Billion In Bitcoin",
    "body": "According to a recent report by Bloomberg, the cybersecurity arm of China has openly accused the US government of orchestrating the theft of approximately $13 billion in Bitcoin (BTC), adding tension to the ongoing cyber relations between the two nations. China Alleges State-Level Operation The incident in question revolves around the theft of 127,272 BTC from the LuBian Bitcoin mining pool in December 2020, constituting one of the most substantial crypto heists in history. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Bottom Out In 300 Days: Top Expert Forecasts $38,000 To $50,000 Price Point The Chinese National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center suggests that this large-scale hack was likely a planned “state-level hacker operation” orchestrated by the US. The agency points to the discreet and delayed movement of the stolen Bitcoin as indicative of governmental involvement rather than typical criminal behavior. The report further links the Bitcoin from LuBian, a former Bitcoin mining firm, to tokens seized by the US government, which authorities claim are linked to Chen Zhi, the chairman of the Cambodian conglomerate Prince Group. Chen Zhi had been accused by the US of participating in a wire-fraud conspiracy and running a money-laundering scheme in October. Notably, details on when and how the Bitcoin was confiscated by the US remain undisclosed. The narrative put forth in the report suggests that the US government might have employed hacking tactics as early as 2020 to appropriate the 127,000 Bitcoin associated with Chen Zhi, characterizing the operation as an example of a “black eats black” maneuver orchestrated by a state-level hacking entity. Bitcoin Forfeiture Fallout Federal prosecutors involved in the Chen case have refrained from disclosing the methods used to gain control of the Bitcoin, following the Department of Justice’s civil forfeiture complaint seizing the 127,271 BTC, which stands as the most substantial forfeiture action undertaken by the US government. Recent statements from the Chinese government have highlighted a growing trend of accusing the American government of engaging in hacking activities. Related Reading: Crypto Treasuries Shift Focus From Bitcoin And Ether To These Lesser-Known Altcoins Earlier this year, China asserted that the US exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers to target Chinese companies. Just last month, China alleged that it possessed undeniable evidence of a US cyber attack on the National Time Service Center. In response to the allegations, a lawyer representing Chen Zhi has filed a request for additional time in a US court to allow for tracing of the stolen BTC from LuBian. The attorney, Matthew L. Schwartz has criticized the government’s claims against Chen as being “seriously misguided.” Schwartz, who serves as counsel to Mr. Chen and the Prince Group, stated that they are collaborating with cryptocurrency experts to trace the Bitcoin seized over a year ago and stolen back in 2020. T At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $102,550, recording losses of 3% in the 24-hour time frame. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Canary Capital filed formal paperwork on Monday that could let an XRP-backed ETF start trading on Nasdaq within days. According to the filing, Canary submitted a Form 8-A to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on November 10, 2025, a move that registers the fund’s shares under the Exchange Act and begins a regulatory clock that can lead to a listing if no objections are raised. Related Reading: Could Shiba Inu Triple? Analyst Sees 200% Move Coming Nasdaq Listing Moves Into Final Steps Based on reports, the shares are expected to trade under the ticker XRPC once Nasdaq completes its listing approval and the regulatory waiting period runs its course. The S-1 prospectus filed earlier says the trust’s shares are expected to be listed for trading subject to notice of issuance on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Market players say a key legal mechanism is now in motion. Canary removed a delaying amendment from its S-1, which triggers a 20-day countdown to automatic effectiveness unless the SEC acts. That change has led some issuers to target a November 13 listing date, though final sign-off by Nasdaq and any SEC comments could shift that plan. CEO Steven McClurg at Canary Capital on XRPETF.. #XRP pic.twitter.com/2UnDKdvc4R — RIZ.. 🇺🇸 🇵🇷 (@RizXRP) November 10, 2025 Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg said the XRP ETF could potentially double the gains Solana saw in its first week. He pointed to strong interest in XRP, reflected in its market capitalization and trading activity. Fund Details And Fees Reports have disclosed some of the fund’s basic terms. The Canary product lists a management fee of 0.50% and names custodians that are already familiar in crypto ETF work, including Gemini Trust Company and BitGo Trust Company. The trust also names US Bank as the cash custodian and US Bancorp Fund Services in an administrative role, according to market write-ups. The background numbers help frame the potential scale. According to earlier SEC filings, as of October 8, 2025, the aggregate market value of XRP was about $173 billion, which placed XRP among the top five digital assets by market cap at that date. That size is one reason multiple issuers have pushed to bring XRP into ETF wrappers. At the time of writing, XRP’s market cap stood at a little over $146 billion.

    "title": "SUI Eyes Key Retest As Price Breaks Out Of Downtrend – Rally To $3 Ahead?",
    "body": "Amid the recent market volatility, SUI is attempting to hold a key level as support following its breakout from a local resistance. Some analysts have suggested that if momentum holds, the altcoin could be preparing for a 50% rally to the next major resistance. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Reclaims $3,500 Amid Market Rebound, Analysts Forecast December Take-Off SUI Recovers Major Support Zone On Tuesday, SUI retested a crucial area as support after recovering from the recent market crash and breaking out of a one-month downtrend line. The altcoin traded between $2.30-$3.00 after the October 10 correction, when the cryptocurrency briefly crashed by over 87% to $0.50. However, the early November pullback sent the price below the local range and to seven-month low levels. Last week, SUI closed below the $2.00 barrier for the first time since April, briefly retesting the $1.80 area. After bouncing from this zone, the altcoin surged above $2.00, retesting this level as support over the weekend. As a result, SUI’s price started the new week reaching a one-week high of $2.20 on Monday, before retracing alongside most of the market on Tuesday morning. Amid its recovery, analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted that the TD Sequential indicator flashed a buy signal for the cryptocurrency, suggesting that the bottom could be in and a rally to higher levels is next. The analyst later confirmed the buy signal, adding that “sustained buying pressure here could push it to $3 or even $4.” Adding to the potential momentum, the Sui Network announced a partnership between the exchange Crypto.com and the Sui Foundation, the organization behind the adoption and advancement of the ecosystem. According to the announcement, the exchange has launched regulated custody and liquidity support for SUI, giving institutions’ clients “a secure, compliant way to store, manage, and access deep liquidity for SUI.” Downtrend Breakout Eyes 50% Rally Offering a broader outlook, market watcher Daan Crypto Trades noted that the cryptocurrency continues to trade within its big higher timeframe (HT) area, currently retesting a make-or-break zone. Notably, SUI has been hovering between the $2.00-$4.00 levels for most of the cycle, with the range’s lower boundary serving as a major support zone since late 2024. Now, the price “is holding initially on this higher low,” but must show short-term strength to break out from this area. Per the post, the altcoin has also broken out of its one-month diagonal resistance, which could send the price back to pre-November pullback levels. Currently, SUI’s price is retesting the downtrend line as support, which could turn the correction into a deviation and propel a move back above $2.30. “That’d be a solid sign of strength for me that this might be due for a larger reversal,” the trader added. Similarly, analyst Crypto Kaleo highlighted the recent performance, affirming that “when SUI breaks out of a major downtrend, it rips.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Derivatives Market Is Taking Off Again, But What Does This Mean For Price? As he pointed out, the cryptocurrency broke out of similar downtrends during the May and July rallies, soaring more than 50% within a week. Therefore, if the altcoin holds the current levels, its price could jump to the $3.00 barrier in the short term. Nonetheless, he warned that the two previous breakouts also saw some volatility after the initial move, suggesting another retest of the downtrend line could happen before the next leg up. As of this writing, SUI is trading at $2.07, a 3.8% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Spot Demand Growing For First Time Since Early October: CryptoQuant Head",
    "body": "CryptoQuant’s head of research has revealed how the “Apparent Demand” metric is now showing growth for the first time in more than a month. Bitcoin Apparent Demand Has Flipped Positive Recently In a new post on X, Julio Moreno, head of research at on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, has talked about the latest trend in the Apparent Demand for Bitcoin. This metric measures, as its name suggests, the amount of spot demand that’s currently present for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: XRP To $10? Analyst Reveals What Could Be The Spark The indicator’s value is calculated by taking the difference between BTC’s production and changes in its inventory. “Production” here refers to the amount that miners are introducing into circulation each day. Similarly, the asset’s “inventory” is the amount stashed away in the 1-year inactive supply. Now, here is the chart shared by Moreno that shows how the 30-day sum of the Apparent Demand has changed over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day sum of the Bitcoin Apparent Demand fell into the negative territory last month, suggesting demand for the asset was decreasing. Recently, however, the metric has witnessed a sharp surge back into the positive territory. Thus, it would appear that, for the first time since early October, demand for BTC is growing again. While spot buying demand may be growing now, attention over in the perpetual futures market is down. As on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post, the Bitcoin Futures Open Interest has remained at low levels since last month’s leverage flush. The Futures Open Interest here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of perpetual futures positions related to Bitcoin that are currently open on all centralized exchanges. From the chart, it’s visible this metric saw a huge plunge in October as the drawdown in the BTC price liquidated a large amount of positions. The indicator has remained at its lows since this decline, indicating that there isn’t much speculative buildup happening in the market. “Derivatives activity has slowed materially, mirroring the broader backdrop of subdued market sentiment,” noted Glassnode. Related Reading: XRP Jumps To $2.56 Despite 240% Increase In Profit Taking Another side of the sector where demand has been weak is the US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As the chart shared by Glassnode in a separate X post shows, the US Bitcoin spot ETFs have mostly seen outflows since early October. “This trend points to a broader de-risking phase among ETF investors,” explained the analytics firm. BTC Price Bitcoin has retraced some of its latest recovery as its price has come down to $103,200. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, CryptoQuant.com, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Most Reliable Bitcoin Boom Indicator Just Went Off-Script: Expert",
    "body": "Chartered Market Technician (CMT) Tony “The Bull” Severino argues that Bitcoin’s most dependable macro tell—the copper-to-gold ratio—has broken character at the very moment the market typically enters a parabolic phase, leaving the post-halving script in disarray and altcoins without their usual rotation. Why The Copper/Gold Ratio Is Crucial For Bitcoin In a 16-minute video analysis published on November 10, Severino frames the copper/gold ratio as a “growth versus fear index,” where copper strength signals expansion, rising yields and appetite for risk, while gold outperformance maps to recession risk, falling yields and risk-off behavior. “When gold is performing better than copper, it typically means economic slowdown [and] general recession fears,” he said, adding that copper’s industrial demand anchors the ratio to the business cycle. The punchline: the ratio’s cyclical turn that historically coincides with Bitcoin’s vertical phase simply never arrived. “They say the most dangerous thing to say in investing is that this time is different. Well, this time is different,” Severino said. “The business cycle based on the copper versus gold ratio did not turn back up.” Severino contends that the four-year halving lore is at best incomplete and at worst misattributed. He overlays prior halving dates with a Fisher Transform signal on the copper/gold ratio and observes that the true inflection has historically been macro, not supply-driven. “I never really thought it was the halving,” he said. “The same halving date started a bull run in the Nasdaq the halving in Bitcoin would not really have any effect on tech stocks.” In his construction, the halving has coincided with, rather than caused, the ratio’s upswing and a risk-on impulse that typically propels Bitcoin beyond prior highs into a final, parabolic leg. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Up Today? Key Reasons Explained This cycle diverged. After briefly producing a “higher high” in the ratio—the first since roughly 2010—copper/gold failed to establish a higher low and instead printed “another lower low,” marking, in Severino’s words, the lowest reading in about 15 years on his chart—“since pretty much since the Great Recession.” The Fisher Transform that had historically flipped up to confirm the risk-on window never delivered the full follow-through. “It was supposed to send Bitcoin into the final stage of its parabolic rally […] we didn’t go parabolic after going above all-time high. We’re just kind of meandering sideways.” Is The Bitcoin Cycle Top In? Timing-wise, that failure matters. Severino measures roughly a year between the ratio’s go-signal and Bitcoin’s cycle top in prior episodes. By that yardstick, “we really should have topped” already or, if anchored to the March breakout above the 2021 high, would at least be entering a risk-off window. But without the definitive risk-on impulse, the cycle landmarks blur. “Because we didn’t get the full risk on, I don’t know where the risk off signal is,” he said. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Analysis: Pre-Rally Signals Point To $180,000 Target In Q1 2026 The implications extend to altcoins and Bitcoin dominance. Historically, the ratio’s green “risk-on” phase lined up with “alt season,” but this time the setup never materialized. “You normally get your alt season at these green points […] We didn’t get it here,” Severino said, noting Bitcoin dominance is holding key support on higher-timeframe views. He also highlights an “extremely strong negative correlation” between Bitcoin and the copper/gold ratio at present; in past cycles, correlation drifting toward zero tended to coincide with altseason. “None of the conditions for altcoin season seem to be here based on past economic signals,” he added. Severino stops short of a deterministic call. The ratio’s trend structure is ambiguous—one failed breakout from a long downtrend does not make an uptrend—and the Fisher signal could still turn. But until it does, he argues, macro says caution. “We’re still in the fear sort of side of this ratio. We need to still be defensive and we should be risk off. When this starts to turn back up, we can consider being bullish risk assets again.” That ambiguity, he suggests, is precisely why Bitcoin’s post-ATH drift has defied the well-worn four-year narrative: “It just didn’t do the same thing as it did in the past […] We are different. It is genuinely different this time.” At press time, BTC traded at $104,486. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Evolves As Beyond Technology Unlocks New Possibilities — Details",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s next chapter is unfolding, and Beyond is constructing a bridge that links BTC’s unmatched security and store-of-value status with the dynamic utility of modern blockchain ecosystems. This is a redefinition of BTC’s role in the global financial architecture, opening pathways for integration that could finally merge the worlds of traditional finance and decentralized networks. Why Interoperability Is The Key To Bitcoin’s Next Phase The crypto world has grappled with a fundamental paradox, and Beyond is building the bridge that Bitcoin has been waiting for. The Founder of DrAlphaweb3 and ordinalcarrots, Dr.OVG, has highlighted that BTC will remain the leading store of value, but in many decentralized finance (DeFi) setups, it is either locked out or wrapped. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Holds $100K as Investors Move Toward This New DeFi Crypto Project By enabling BTC liquidity to move natively across chains, like layer 1s, layer 2s, and various DeFi protocols, Beyond is set to unleash BTCFi. Specifically, the initiative will enable BTC holders to lend, borrow, earn yield, and deploy their BTC without sacrificing decentralisation and security. This innovation is critical because it will unlock BTC utility as it grows to transition into an active player in the global DeFi economy. Dr.OVG concluded that traders might see some crazy runners, so individuals should position themselves accordingly. A project and protocol writer, Mattcrypted, has also mentioned that BTCFi thrives with seamless UX powered by LayerZero’s Omni-chain Fungible Token (OFT) technology. Meanwhile, Beyond bridges connections with Echoport Ordinals to 140+ chains and 200+ partners for users to move BTC and LSTs effortlessly. With Beyond mainnet set to go live in Q4, the network will support the meta protocol, sidechain wrappers, and L2 integrations. In this innovation, the dual sale structure behind the upcoming project is also designed to deliver bear market-proof valuation for token sales. The combination of a token launchpad and Ordinals participation will ensure wide accessibility during the token sales. On the technical front, EVMs would seamlessly operate as a trusted protocol backed by Animoca Brands and vVv, which is bullish, and Beyond would pioneer BTC connections across the ecosystem. Why Bitcoin Next Chapter Demands Interoperability Bitcoin is not meant to stay siloed. According to a Web3 builder, Jaouad, Beyond is a native BTC L1 interoperability layer that enables seamless movement of any token within Bitcoin while linking the flagship crypto, BRC-20s, Runes, and more to over 100 chains.

    "title": "XRP’s Next ‘Face-Melting’ Rally Could Hit Within 6 Weeks—Analyst",
    "body": "Some analysts expect XRP to climb sharply from its current price of $2.39. According to posts on X by a popular analyst known as Egrag Crypto, the coin is trading at the bottom of a descending triangle and could stage a strong rally in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Could Shiba Inu Triple? Analyst Sees 200% Move Coming Analysts Point To Historical Setups According to Egrag, two earlier runs give the pattern some weight. He compared the present chart to moves in 2017 and 2021. Back then, XRP went from $0.097 to $3.84 across a roughly three-month span around 2017–2018. In 2021, it rose from below $0.45 to above $1.90 in two monthly candles. Based on those moves, he expects a comeback within four to six weeks and projects gains of about 300% to 1,400% from today’s price. #XRP – ⚔️ Weakness? Or Just Testing the Faith of Bulls? 💎 Lately, I’ve seen many #XRP Bulls turning #Bearish 😔, frustrated by the sideways chop and the boring price action. They say things like “I see weakness on the HTF.” Let me tell you what I see 👁️‍🗨️: I see traders… pic.twitter.com/5WTibse9r7 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 11, 2025 “Mark my words: XRP will usually melt faces within 4–6 weeks, and history backs it up with evidence,” Egrag, who put a target range of $10 to $37 for this cycle, said. “I see traders chickening out, scared to lose their 10x gains. And that’s fine , protecting profits is smart,” he added. Other market voices have echoed parts of that view, reposting Egrag’s chart and wrote that XRP is “busy testing bulls’ faith.” ETF Filing Moves Forward Meanwhile, according to filings and reporting, Canary Capital has taken a key step toward launching a spot XRP ETF in the US. The firm filed a Form 8-A, a move that, once Nasdaq signs off, would let the fund list its shares. Crypto reporter Eleanor Terrett said the filing will become effective at 5:30 p.m. ET once Nasdaq certifies it, and trading is set to start when US markets open on Thursday, November 14, 2025. That development matters because an ETF can make an asset easier for many investors to buy. It does not mean prices will automatically skyrocket. It does mean more attention, and that can change market behavior in ways that are hard to predict. 🚨NEW: @CanaryFunds has filed its Form 8-A. This is the final step before it goes effective at 5:30 PM ET Wednesday once the Nasdaq certifies the listing. When that happens, the last hurdle is cleared and the first $XRP spot ETF will be set to launch Thursday at market open. pic.twitter.com/mXvkrrXbiJ — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) November 11, 2025 Short-Term Data And Market Tone At press time, XRP was trading around $2.39, down about 3% over the last 24 hours. Technical traders focus on where the price sits inside the triangle pattern and watch volume for confirmation of a breakout. Related Reading: XRP ETF Canary Takes Flight: 8-A Filing Clears Path To Nasdaq Listing Some see the structure as a setup for a large move either way. Others point out that the market environment today is not the same as in 2017 or 2021, given bigger trading volumes and different regulatory factors. The ETF timing adds a new element to watch. If Nasdaq approves Canary Capital’s Form 8-A as reported, the first spot XRP shares could start trading on Thursday. Markets often react to such milestones, but how big that reaction will be is unknown. Featured image from Gemini, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Path To $1 Million Clears With OG Sellers Fading: Dave Weisberger",
    "body": "Former chairman and co-founder of CoinRoutes and now president of BetterTrade.digital Dave Weisberger used a November 11 video to restate Bitcoin’s long-term bull case, arguing that the market’s “morose” sentiment and technician-driven calls for downside are missing the structural shift underway on both fundamentals and market microstructure. He framed his analysis in two parts—why Bitcoin is being bought and what the current market structure implies—contending that the thesis toward seven-figure pricing remains intact even without an obvious near-term catalyst. The Path To $1 Million Per Bitcoin On fundamentals, he drew a direct comparison with gold’s monetary role and size. Citing an above-ground market value of “around $28 trillion” and “about $7 trillion in known reserves below ground,” Weisberger argued that roughly 80% of gold’s value is monetary, not industrial, using the platinum–gold price relationship as a proxy. “Gold today trades at about two and a half times platinum, which for most of my life was about double the price of gold,” he said, adding that platinum is “30 times rarer and more valued by women in jewelry.” From that relative-value lens, he estimated gold’s “monetary value fully diluted around $28 trillion,” contrasting it with Bitcoin’s “fully diluted market cap just over $2 trillion at today’s prices.” Related Reading: China’s Cybersecurity Agency Alleges US Government Stole $13 Billion In Bitcoin If Bitcoin equals or surpasses gold on monetary characteristics, he argued, the gap implies transformative upside: “It could rise to equal gold. Except it’s better than gold on monetary characteristics.” He emphasized Bitcoin’s native digital finality, resistance to counterfeiting, divisibility, transparency, and programmatic supply schedule—benefits that also avoid gold’s custody, assay, and transport frictions. Even in a scenario where fiat “holds its value,” he suggested, network adoption alone could warrant a multi-fold repricing; in a debasement regime, he said, the asymmetry is stronger: “As the Bitcoin network grows and it gains acceptance it’ll likely rise by 10 times this or more.” Via X, he added “the Fundamental case” is $1 million in today’s dollars. Weisberger revisited the “fastest horse” framing popularized in the early COVID-era liquidity surge. He pointed to Paul Tudor Jones’s thesis in “May of 2020,” acknowledging he misspoke initially, and reminded viewers that the price then “did nothing” for months before a stepwise acceleration from October through the subsequent euphoric leg higher. The lesson, in his view, is that market tone can lag fundamentals until positioning resets and liquidity leadership rotates back to Bitcoin. “History doesn’t always repeat, but it can sometimes rhyme,” he said. On market structure, Weisberger took aim at the four-year halving cycle as a predictive template. Historically, he said, cyclical behavior followed a pattern—halving, a six-month period of miner-incentive doubt, then a relief-to-euphoria rally that later bled into altcoin rotation before a broad drawdown. He argued that dynamic is losing relevance because supply changes are now “irrelevant relative to the amount of demand that’s going on,” while network security trends tell a different story: “If you look at the Bitcoin hash rate chart, it’s increasing at a geometric pace.” The moving parts he sees actually driving prices are the interaction of legacy supply and institutional demand. “It’s basically the OG sellers who are selling over 100,000 [BTC] and the new buyers, whether they’re in ETFs or in MicroStrategy, etc.” Those early holders, in his telling, are rationally diversifying life-changing gains rather than capitulating, which implies a finite overhang: “Entrepreneurs don’t generally sell everything […] they sell some at a level to get where they need to be and then […] sell at later prices.” He underscored that spot ETF investors appear patient despite recent volatility. “Even after all of the carnage of the last few weeks since October 10th, less than 2% of the Bitcoin ETFs have outflown,” he said, characterizing that cohort as long-horizon allocators “looking for a 10x gain,” not trading around single-digit drawdowns. He contrasted October’s deleveraging—“$20 billion was liquidated […] but only five billion of the liquidation was in Bitcoin”—with the 2022 insolvency cascade: “This cycle doesn’t have a Celsius […] doesn’t have an FTX. The impact of the liquidations is not going to be to cause an insolvency event which causes forced sales.” Without a credit-driven unwind, he argued, technical analogies to 2022 are misplaced: “If there’s no forced sales, why do we expect a sale on the magnitude that happened in 2022 […]? They’re trying to impute something without taking into account the actual circumstance.” Related Reading: Most Reliable Bitcoin Boom Indicator Just Went Off-Script: Expert Price leadership, in his view, will return through “liquidity and slow grinding growth” while “hot money” recovers from leverage-driven losses. He expects the OG selling to “abate,” as partial profit-taking runs its course, setting the stage for the next euphoric leg once a catalyst emerges. Weisberger did not pretend to know which spark will ignite it—“I’m not a Nostradamus”—but listed plausible vectors that are consistent with prior cycles: “The catalyst could be sovereign accumulation. The catalyst could be Bitcoin being used as collateral […] It doesn’t really matter what the catalyst is.” The key risk for would-be sellers, he suggested, is time out of the market during the inflection: “Unless you are very nimble, very quick, have no tax consequences, and aren’t out of the market or on vacation in the two or three days when euphoria first starts, then I would be very, very reticent to sell here.” My 2 part Bitcoin analysis: 1) The Fundamental case for $1 Million Bitcoin in TODAYS dollar 2) Why the current gloom is unwarranted & now is a great time to accumulate Bitcoin for the long haul The Bull Case For Bitcoin 11 11 https://t.co/0ACKrn3bgQ via @YouTube — Dave W (@daveweisberger1) November 12, 2025 He closed with a caution that acknowledges the market’s capacity to frustrate both bulls and bears. “Maybe euphoria will happen after it continues to drag on and fall for another few months, but at some point it will happen,” he said. He disclosed his positioning—“I have not sold any sats, nor do I intend to”—and reiterated the discipline required in a choppy tape: “Stay safe out there. This market does look interesting and is going to likely stay that way for a while.” At press time, BTC traded at $104,954. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin Price Rally Above $0.74 ATHs In The Works As HTF Trend Holds",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Balo has assured that the Dogecoin price rally to a new all-time high (ATH) above $0.74 is in the works. He explained why this rally may be closer than some may imagine despite the recent bearish price action. Dogecoin Price Eyes Rally Above $0.74 ATH In an X post, crypto analyst Balo shared an accompanying chart showing that the Dogecoin price could surpass its current all-time high of $0.74, reaching $0.8 in the process. This came as the analyst opined that a major run was imminent for the foremost meme coin, despite its current downtrend. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Worst-Case Scenario For Dogecoin This Cycle Balo explained that at each local bottom since early 2024, there has always been a “messy” Dogecoin price action that looks designed to shake people out before the real jump. He added that DOGE has made higher lows and maintained the higher-timeframe (HTF) trend, and that the same price pattern appears to be repeating now. The crypto analyst also admitted that the parabolic surge for the Dogecoin price may feel far away, but that each mini cycle brings DOGE closer to its bull run. He also stated that this gives investors more time to accumulate before the DOGE price rallies to a new all-time high, which he claimed is just a matter of time. This bullish prediction for the Dogecoin price comes amid its current downtrend, with the meme coin struggling below the psychological $0.2 level. DOGE has continued to mirror Bitcoin’s price action, and with the flagship crypto threatening to drop below $100,000 again, crypto analyst Dogecoin OG predicts that the meme coin could fall to the $0.16 range. Analyst Predicts Mega Run For DOGE Crypto analyst Crypto Patel has also provided a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, declaring that the meme coin was ready for its next historic mega run. The analyst stated that the breakout and retest are complete and that the structure is locked and loaded for a parabolic explosion. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Set For 1,200% Rally To $2.2 In This 3rd Run Furthermore, Crypto Patel revealed that the same pattern that sent the Dogecoin price flying during the 2017 and 2021 bull cycles is repeating again on the monthly timeframe. He added that the move looks even more powerful this time around. As such, he expects DOGE to rally 10x to 33x based on the fractal confluence and macro breakout structure. Patel stated that targets 1 and 2 are $2 and $5, respectively, both of which mark new ATHs for the meme coin. His accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could reach these targets sometime next year. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.17, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "3 Top Trending Crypto to Watch as Tether Records Big Profits",
    "body": "What to Know: Tether’s new commodities desk and expanding gold reserves show crypto’s largest stablecoin is morphing into a broader financial platform. Tether’s recent Q3 report showcases profits north of $10B and a balance sheet of over $181B. For traders seeking trending crypto, infra plus utility shines: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), Best Wallet Token ($BEST), and Polkadot ($DOT) align with this shift. $DOT offers cross-chain optionality near multi-year value zones as flows broaden beyond ETH/SOL; watch ecosystem execution. Tether just signaled it’s not content being ‘only’ a stablecoin giant. In a headline-grabbing move, the company poached HSBC’s top precious-metals executives to build a commodities desk, an unmistakable push into the bullion trade. Vincent Domien and Mathew O’Neill, senior metals leaders at HSBC, are set to spearhead the new unit, according to a Bloomberg article . That’s the crypto world stepping directly onto TradFi’s most guarded turf. Why now? The firm’s latest attestation shows year-to-date profits above $10B , excess reserves of $6.8B, and double-digit billions in gold and bitcoin on the books—financial firepower that turns experiments into strategy. With a balance sheet of over $181B, liquidity ripples across crypto. For now, momentum is pointing sideways, but historically, fresh institutional rails have opened new speculative lanes. That’s why capital is hunting narratives with clear catalysts—the kind that could benefit Bitcoin scaling plays, utility tokens tied to wallets, and high-beta layer-zero ecosystems. With that as a context, here are three crypto to watch as this story unfolds. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin Rollup Narrative With SVM Firepower If Tether is normalizing real-world collateral on-chain, the next crowd-pleaser is throughput: cheap, fast execution secured by Bitcoin. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) pitches exactly that, an SVM-powered rollup aligned to $BTC settlement, aiming to make Bitcoin app-usable without impacting its security. The project’s documents and public dev notes emphasize native Solana-program compatibility, sequencing research, and a rollup-first security model, pragmatic signals for builders who want speed but won’t compromise finality. For traders watching risk rotations, a ‘Bitcoin L2 with Solana-grade performance’ is a potent narrative, while tools like the Canonical Bridge create powerful utility by dropping confirmation times from hours to seconds and reducing transaction costs significantly. The presale numbers back up the interest: over $26.9M raised so far, with a token price of $0.013255 and virtually unlimited potential. This alone makes $HYPER one of the best crypto to watch today. Based on Hyper’s value proposition, meme context, and impact on Bitcoin’s ecosystem, our price prediction for $HYPER proposes a price point of $0.08625 by the end of 2026. An easy 550% ROI if you invest at today’s price. If this sounds like profit, read our guide on how to buy $HYPER before doing anything else. Then head to the official presale page to secure your $HYPER allocation today. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Utility Token for an Active Web3 Wallet Wallet tokens trend when retail flows return. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) leverages this approach with tangible in-app perks, including reduced swap fees, early access to curated presales, boosted staking tiers, and card rewards, thereby tying token ownership to ongoing wallet usage. The token supports the Best Wallet ecosystem, which offers top security, non-custodial services, and access to a variety of present and upcoming features. These include the Best Card and the Best Dex, with access to over 50 chains. For traders, the angle is simple: if Tether’s push accelerates tokenized-asset adoption, the next wave of users needs a wallet that lowers frictions and funnels opportunities. $BEST attempts to monetize that funnel. The presale raised over $16.9M so far, with $BEST valued at $0.025935. Based on the token’s utility and Best Wallet’s value proposition, our price prediction for $BEST puts it at $0.05106175 by the end of 2026. As an early investor, you’re looking at a 96% ROI over the course of 12 months. You can read our guide on how to buy $BEST to learn more about the purchasing process. Go to the presale page and buy your $BEST today. 3. Polkadot ($DOT) — Cross-Chain Upgrades at ‘Value’ Altcoin Levels Not every rotation needs seed-stage risk. At roughly $3 and a $5B-class market cap, Polkadot ($DOT) screens as ‘value beta’ among layer-0s, with a multi-year push to simplify parachain economics and improve bridging safety. Real-time dashboards put $DOT at $3.11 and market cap just over $5B, with mainstream investor outlets flagging similar levels. If tokenized real-world assets ramp, cross-chain messaging and sovereign app-chains re-enter the conversation—and $DOT’s architecture was built for that. For developers, the play is specialized chains with common security; for traders, it’s the optionality that comes with volumes broadening beyond Ethereum and Solana. Key catalysts to watch include enhancements to core messaging, scheduling of next-generation parachain auctions, and any progress from $DOT-based RWA pilots. Price-wise, $DOT doesn’t need mania to re-rate; it needs credible throughput demand across its ecosystem—something that tends to firm up when liquidity is allocated to new venues. If Tether’s metals desk deepens on-chain settlement for RWAs, a neutral routing layer like Polkadot starts to look mispriced relative to its optionality. If you want to invest, go to your favorite exchange and buy your $DOT today. Recap: Tether’s raid on HSBC’s bullion bench isn’t a stunt—it’s a signal that tokenized commodities are entering prime time. In that environment, infrastructure and utility stand to benefit. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to be the BTC-secured rollup where apps actually run; Best Wallet Token ($BEST) anchors wallet-level utility and user acquisition; Polkadot ($DOT) offers cross-chain plumbing at a ‘value’ multiple.

    "title": "Canary Capital’s $XRP ETF Is Imminent. $SUBBD Could Be Next In Line",
    "body": "What to Know: An $XRP spot ETF listing widens regulated access to altcoins, which usually tightens spreads and deepens liquidity across adjacent sectors. Canary’s 8-A form points to a Thursday debut; $XRP already saw a price pop and volume surge into the launch window. SUBBD introduces on-chain subscriptions, token-gated content, and AI assistants that turn creator-fan interactions into repeatable transactions. The presale sits at over $1.33M, with $SUBBD valued at $0.056925 and staking at a fixed 20%. Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF has cleared the last major hurdle and is now teed up to begin trading on the Nasdaq as early as Thursday, with listing references pointing to the ticker ‘XRPC.’ $XRP reacted on cue, notching an intraday jump of up to 10% while 24-hour trading volumes swelled by roughly 40%, sending spot prices near $2.43. The timing isn’t random. In September, US exchanges won the ability to use generic listing standards for spot crypto ETFs, compressing timelines that used to drag on for months. That rule change opened the door for non-$BTC assets to follow, and the first wave has already shown how fast the playbook can run once the plumbing is in place. 💡 If $XRP joins $ETH and $SOL in the ETF club, altcoin liquidity broadens, spreads tighten, and flows begin migrating from pure crypto rails to brokerage accounts. That’s real market structure change, not just another narrative. And for $XRP, that’s payments and creator-facing commerce where fast settlement and low fees matter. This is where one of the season’s better-positioned presales, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD), is pitching utility instead of vibes: an AI-powered creator subscription stack with on-chain payments, content gating, and baked-in rewards. $XRP ETF Opens The Floodgates For Altcoin Liquidity A confirmed listing path for an $XRP spot product means passive money can finally ‘buy the basket’ of large-cap alts without dealing with self-custody. Canary’s trust moved forward after a Form 8-A filing – typically the final procedural check before trading – while market monitors flag a Thursday go-live window. That backdrop should play well for projects tied to real spend. 💡 SUBBD’s design is straightforward: creators sell subscriptions, fans unlock content and features, and $SUBBD settles the exchange while powering perks like discounts, XP multipliers, and early feature access. The team frames it as an AI-driven layer for the already-massive subscription content market. This includes native token incentives that reduce platform take rates and keep more earnings with the people actually making the content. If ETF flows are the macro tide, platforms that turn that liquidity into daily transactions are the shoreline. The SUBBD ecosystem is one of them. SUBBD Turns Creator Subscriptions Into On-Chain Utility On the product side, SUBBD ($SUBBD) ships the elements most creator platforms still duct-tape: payments, token-gated content, and AI assistants to handle requests, chat, and simple management chores. Holders pay less for subscriptions, stake to amplify XP and rewards, and gain access to exclusive drops and beta features. 🔄 For top creators, staking also unlocks VIP perks and collaboration opportunities. It’s a clean loop: pay, participate, earn, repeat – all recorded on-chain for better transparency. The $SUBBD whitepaper lays out an ecosystem where the $SUBBD token is the medium of exchange and the incentive rail, with staking and gamification stitched directly into the product rather than bolted on. Tokenomics mirror that utility focus. Allocations reserve a dedicated pool for staking rewards and liquidity, with the rest split across development, marketing, airdrops, and community incentives. Staking is live at a fixed 20% rate during presale, with a short cooldown after claiming. It’s the kind of predictable reward that helps creators and fans set expectations while the platform ramps. If you want a token built around actual usage – paid subscriptions and content access – this is the pitch, so get your $SUBBD today Presale Math And The Near-Term Upside The presale has raised $1.33M+, with a current token price of $0.056925 and staking rewards locked at 20% APY. 💰 $SUBBD’s potential is massive, though. Our price prediction for $SUBBD sees a possiblw 2026 high of around $0.668, which – if reached – implies roughly 11.6x gains from the current presale mark. That’s an ROI of 1,073%. The estimates lean on standard drivers: user growth, exchange access, and delivery of the AI tooling that turns creators into full-stack micro-businesses. None of that is guaranteed, but the path is more practical than many presales. The $XRP ETF matters here because liquidity attention tends to cascade. Payments-adjacent and creator-commerce projects sit close to XRP’s core utility narrative, so they often see spillover when fresh ETF demand hits the tape. If $XRP volumes lift and spreads compress, user-facing apps with low-friction payments usually benefit next. $SUBBD is positioning for that moment with a working economic loop and clear rewards. The first steps have already been taken, as the project has already onboarded the 2K+ of the top content creators, bringing a combined following of 250M+. So, read our guide on how to buy $SUBBD and head to the official presale website for more information. 🚀 The conclusion is simple: buy $SUBBD today before the train leaves the station.

    "body": "The cryptocurrency market has weathered a challenging period, testing the resolve of the most seasoned investors. After a prolonged period of downward pressure, the Bitcoin Supply-Loss Chart is flashing a possible bottom signal. A Deeper Look At Bitcoin Supply In Loss Chart Bitcoin on-chain data on the loss chart is currently flashing a possible bottom. In an X post, CryptosRus has revealed that the supply in the Loss metric chart tracks the total amount of BTC held by addresses where the current market price is below the average cost basis of those holdings. Essentially, the portion of BTC owners is currently underwater on their investment. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Bottom Out In 300 Days: Top Expert Forecasts $38,000 To $50,000 Price Point As a sentiment indicator, the high levels of supply in the Loss chart typically signal fear, capitulation selling, and potential market bottoms. In addition, the low levels indicate broad profitability and market greed. On April 7, 2025, when BTC traded around $74,508, the supply in loss was 5.159 million BTC. By November 5, 2025, even with BTC rising to $98,966, the supply in loss had also increased to 5.639 million BTC. During mid-2024, a similar situation reportedly occurred, marking the bottom at that time. The expert also outlined particular areas on the chart marked as 3, 4, and 5, which show uncanny similarities. Furthermore, in October 2025, recent lows showed a sharp spike in losses amid volatility, with approximately 30% of supply going underwater. On the chart, the yellow boxes highlight a rapid build-up, which has been a potent precursor to the market bottom. Currently, the supply in the loss has climbed to 28% and 33%, which is equivalent to 5.5 million BTC to 6.5 million BTC, matching the October endpoint on the chart and echoing the correction patterns seen in 2024. CryptosRus concluded that this may bring short-term bearish pressure, but it could flush out the final weak holders, opening the way for a bounce in Q4 and Q1 2026. The Accumulation Phase Before The Breakout Bitcoin has experienced three major corrections in this cycle, and each one has eventually led to a new all-time high after months of conviction. According to an analyst known as 0xBossman, this correction is no different, and each of these corrections has been brutal in its own way. BTC’s market flushed out the leveraged traders, resulting in them losing it all. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market Peak Indicators Says Hold Despite Crash Below $100,000, What’s Happening? Meanwhile, the boredom that comes as a result of these corrections is what has led to the bearish sentiment. The market feels indecisive, and altcoins have bled. Thus, 0xBossman advised that traders should step back and realize that this consolidation will end with a massive green candle. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",
