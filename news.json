    "title": "Bitcoin Adjusted SOPR Shows Market At Pivotal Junction — What’s Next?",
    "body": "Over the past week, the Bitcoin market experienced new waves of liquidations with prices dropping to around $81,000 on Thursday. Though the premier cryptocurrency has seen a slight rebound since then, bearish sentiments remain dominant with analysts expecting a potential decline to as low as $56,000. Amid this recent correction, a developing on-chain situation has reached a boiling point, putting the Bitcoin market at a critical juncture. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slide To $82K Sets Off A $1.7 Billion Chain Reaction Bitcoin aSOPR Holds Clue To Next Market Phase – Analyst The Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) is an on-chain metric used to measure whether Bitcoin investors are, on average, selling their coins at a profit or at a loss, while filtering out noise from short-term, low-value movements. In usual market trends, each new price peak is accompanied by higher conviction as investors are willing to hold longer, take profits later, and tolerate larger drawdowns because they expect even higher prices. However, during Bitcoin’s ascent from around $40,000 in early 2024 to over $100,000, the aSOPR has shown a different pattern as observed by market analyst MorenoDV. Despite a consistent uptrend resulting in multiple price peaks, Bitcoin aSOPR established a downtrend pattern marked by lower highs and lower lows, thereby creating a puzzling market divergence. According to MorenoDV, this development suggests that Bitcoin traders were aggressively taking profits with each rally, indicating a lack of long-term market confidence. Considering the descending profit-taking pattern, it can also be inferred that investors were satisfied with smaller and smaller gains, suggesting they were no longer convinced that upside continuation was likely. Related Reading: Bitmine Stakes Additional 250,912 Ethereum Worth $745M – 61% Is Now Staked The Present Market Debacle Despite the ongoing divergence, it is still observed that aSOPR respects the general market trend with each high in its descending channel aligning with a local price top, while each retest of the lower boundary coincides with a market bottom. Presently, the aSOPR is retesting this lower boundary, in a fear-ridden market with over 30% of market supply in a loss. Ideally, MorenoDV explains these are accumulation opportunities, especially in further consideration of the negative aSOPR. However, the analyst warns that a decisive fall below this line could strengthen present bearish sentiments, resulting in an intense market capitulation, as an already fearful set of investors would likely initiate a sell-off. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade around $83,819, reflecting 0.41% decline in the past day. Following the recent liquidations, the market leader is now 34% away from its all time high of around $126,100. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview",

    "title": "Crypto Funds Bleed $1.80 Billion As Metals Rally Heats Up",
    "body": "Investors stepped back this week as a mix of shifting bets and quick profit-taking pushed money out of spot crypto ETFs. Markets moved fast, and some of the biggest swings were driven by short-term reactions rather than a change in long-term views. Related Reading: Ethereum Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech Spot Crypto ETF Flows Based on reports from Farside, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs saw about $1.50 billion leave over five trading days, while spot Ether ETFs had roughly $327 million in outflows. That adds up to about $1.80 billion pulled from these funds in just a few days. On Jan. 14, reports note a very large inflow for Bitcoin ETFs — $840 million — which shows how quickly money can go in and out. Some traders treated that day as a buying moment. Others used it to take profit. That push-and-pull shows up in the numbers. A Rally In Metals, Then A Sudden Drop Gold and silver grabbed attention when they climbed to fresh highs. Prices surged, and many investors moved money into precious metals. But the rally was short-lived. On a single trading day, gold fell sharply from its peak and silver tumbled even more. Reports say those sudden reversals left some investors rethinking their moves and helped create a wave of selling across other risk assets, including crypto. Bitcoin Price Action Bitcoin has been swinging. Over the past week, BTC fell about 6.50% while Ether dropped around 8.90%, and they were trading around $82,500 and $2,685, respectively, according to CoinMarketCap. The market had a short spike after talk of the US CLARITY Act, but prices then cooled. Moves like this are often tied to positioning, margin calls, and traders reacting to headlines. At times, large flows into ETFs have pushed prices up. Other times, outflows coincide with volatile days when traders close positions quickly. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slide To $82K Sets Off A $1.7 Billion Chain Reaction What Analysts Are Saying Reports note that some market watchers view the pullback as temporary. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the current negativity about Bitcoin’s price is short-sighted and pointed to strong performance in prior years as context. Another voice, Bitwise’s Matt Hougan, suggested that continued ETF demand could send Bitcoin into a much higher trajectory over time. These views reflect different timeframes — some focus on immediate flows, others on how steady demand might shape prices months from now. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "Despite a major outflow just a day earlier, Spot XRP ETFs have defied bearish sentiment, setting record trading volumes and attracting fresh inflows. This resilience and surge in investor demand is particularly surprising given the recent crash in the XRP price and the overall downturn in the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Ethereum Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech XRP ETFs Defy Trends And Hit Record Volume XRP is making headlines after its ETF experienced fresh inflows following a significant outflow. According to data from SoSoValue, XRP ETFs saw a record $92.9 million drop on January 29, 2026. This marked the largest reduction since their launch on November 13, 2025. Since becoming available for trading, XRP ETFs have registered only three outflows, with the recent $92.9 million decrease being the third. This withdrawal was primarily driven by Grayscale’s GXRP, which saw a whopping $98.39 million leave the fund, partially offset by inflows into Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ, Bitwise’s XRP ETF, and Canary’s XRPC. At the time of the outflow, the total net assets of XRP ETFs fell to $1.21 billion from $1.39 billion the day earlier. The decline coincided with a drop in XRP’s price, which fell from $1.92 to $1.80 over 24 hours. Unexpectedly, XRP ETFs picked up just a day after the $92.9 million withdrawal. They recorded a daily total net inflow of $16.79 million, although total net assets still declined slightly to $1.19 billion. More impressively, Spot XRP ETFs achieved record trading volumes despite the overall downtrend. Data from The Block shows that XRP ETFs saw their cumulative volume rise to $2.23 billion from $2.15 billion just one day after the $92.9 million daily outflow. Reports indicated that Bitwise’s XRP ETF had the highest trading volume at the time, followed by Grayscale’s GXRP, Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ, Canary’s XRPC, and 21Shares TOXR, in that order. In terms of total Assets Under Management (AUM), XRP ETFs declined slightly, falling from $1.48 billion to $1.32 billion following the January 29 outflow. XRP Price Continues Slide Amid Market Uncertainty While XRP ETFs are recovering from recent outflows, the cryptocurrency’s price continues to decline, extending its losses from earlier this year. According to CoinMarketCap, XRP has dropped by more than 11% over the past week and a little over 3% in the last 24 hours. Following this decline, its price now sits around $1.69, representing a more than 15% fall from its $2 level seen just a few weeks ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slide To $82K Sets Off A $1.7 Billion Chain Reaction XRP’s daily trading volume is also down by more than 26.6% at the time of writing, indicating a potential decline in trader confidence and growing uncertainty in the market. Supporting this trend, XRP’s Fear and Greed Index has fallen into the “Fear” zone.

    "title": "Bitcoin Slips Below This Key Zone — Is A Final Flush Coming?",
    "body": "Bitcoin has once again fallen below a critical support zone, raising questions about whether the market is gearing up for a deeper sell-off. With selling pressure still intact, traders are now watching key levels closely to see if a final flush toward lower support is imminent. Price Faces Another Rejection MakroVision Research shared on X that Bitcoin has once again met strong rejection, resulting in a decisive break below several key support levels. Price has now slipped back into the range of the previous low and continues to trade beneath the critical green resistance zone between $85,200 and $86,200, highlighting that bearish pressure remains in control for now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Begins To Rise, Raising Early Bear Market Concerns On the very short-term timeframe, there are early signs of an attempted rebound, but without a timely and sustainable reclaim of the $85,200–$86,200 zone, this move is best viewed as a technical counter-bounce rather than the start of a meaningful trend reversal. As long as the price remains capped below this area, the broader short-term downtrend remains intact. From a tactical perspective, the $85,200–$86,200 region has become the key battlefield. A clean reclaim and hold above this zone would be the first clear indication that selling pressure is beginning to fade, potentially allowing for price stabilization and a relief rally. If this reclaim attempt fails, the risk of continued downside acceleration increases. In that case, focus would turn to the $72,300–$75,300 range, a technically prominent support zone with historical significance. This zone may ultimately serve as a potential support and reversal region should the market experience another phase of capitulation. CME Gap Opens: What To Expect From Bitcoin This Weekend Crypto analyst MartyParty, in a recent Bitcoin Wyckoff Accumulation update, highlighted that a CME gap is opening, which is expected to be filled by Sunday evening. This sets the stage for potential short-term volatility, with traders closely watching key technical levels and liquidation activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Backs Off Resistance — Breakdown Or Brief Pause? Several scenarios are possible over the coming days. One possibility is the continued liquidation of remaining leveraged longs, with the lowest 25x Binance liquidation currently around $79,350, potentially completing the classic Wyckoff Spring pattern. Another scenario is a retest of secondary support at $81,800, which could act as a temporary floor for Bitcoin’s price action. If support at $81,800 holds, Bitcoin may trade sideways or attempt to push toward the primary support level, which has now turned into resistance at $84,800. The most probable scenario suggests a move up through $84,500 toward $86,463, followed by a retest of $84,500 on Sunday night as the CME gap is filled, completing the near-term Wyckoff accumulation setup.

    "title": "Why Shiba Inu Holders Should Look Forward To Sunday",
    "body": "Shiba Inu has spent recent weeks locked in a downward price action with bullish momentum fading and investor interest thinning without a clear bullish direction. However, holders may finally have something concrete to anticipate. Refreshing activity from Shytoshi Kusama, the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s lead developer, has diverted attention to a key moment expected on Sunday. Lead Dev Breaks Silence, Teases Sunday That dynamic began to change when Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous lead developer and co-founder of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, resurfaced on X after a prolonged absence since early December. However, Kusama broke his silence this week with a thread on X explaining the reasons behind his inactivity and has since returned to regular posting and reposting activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slide To $82K Sets Off A $1.7 Billion Chain Reaction One post stood out more than the rest, in which Kusama hinted at a revelation scheduled for Sunday. In that message, he spoke about arriving at a discovery by pure chance and referenced what he described as an ancient marker older than time itself. Although the message was a bit cryptic, it immediately generated attention across the SHIB community, which has been hungry for direction and clarity amid recent challenges in Shiba Inu’s price action. The significance of Sunday became clearer following an interesting exchange between Kusama and a Shiba Inu community member who openly expressed concerns about transparency, reassurance, and leadership presence after recent ecosystem issues. The community member, known as RuggRat on X, noted how there has been no official statement or simple explanation of what happened from Kusama regarding the Shibarium exploit. This is in reference to the September 2025 Shibarim Bridge exploit, which saw attackers making off with $4.1 million worth of crypto assets. In response, Kusama acknowledged the concern, stating that silence can sometimes be strategic and framing Sunday as a moment for addressing issues step by step. “This is what Sunday is for. One at a time,” Kusama said. Fair. But sometimes silence is a weapon for quiet wars. This is what Sunday is for. One bandage. Take off. Fix. Put on. One at a time. — Shytoshi Kusama™ (@ShytoshiKusama) January 29, 2026 Shiba Inu’s Challenging Phase Has Tested Holder Confidence Shiba Inu’s price action has struggled to gain any meaningful upside traction since the beginning of 2026, an extension of its late 2025 run. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading around $0.0000071, keeping it pinned down by 1.8% and 10.5% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. Price structure during this period has been marked by a series of lower lows, with persistent selling pressure leaving little room for a meaningful higher high to form. Related Reading: Ethereum Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech This prolonged stagnation has been difficult for many Shiba Inu holders, and many of them are increasingly becoming sellers.

    "title": "SUI At The Smart Money Zone: Big Moves Brewing Above $2",
    "body": "SUI is approaching a critical smart money zone, with price action signaling that big moves could be on the horizon. Sustained trading above $2 may trigger a breakout, setting the stage for the next significant leg higher. SUI Reaches Stage For Major Money Entry Crypto analyst Crypto Patel, in a recent post, highlighted that SUI is at the same stage where big money typically enters the market, urging traders not to miss this opportunity. According to the weekly chart, the long-term ascending channel remains intact, and price is currently trading near a sell-side liquidity grab close to trendline support, signaling potential accumulation. Related Reading: SUI Reclaims Key Support With Strength — Is $2.35 The Next Target? The chart also shows strong weekly demand and a bullish order block between $1.15 and $0.80, indicating that the market structure is poised to turn super bullish if SUI clears higher-timeframe resistance. The current compression phase is a classic setup for expansion, meaning the market is preparing for a potential breakout. Crypto Patel emphasized that smart money tends to buy during compression, while retail often enters after confirmation of the move. If the breakout confirms, projected targets for SUI are $5, $10, and $20, illustrating the potential scale of the next trend. As Crypto Patel puts it, “This is how big trends are built, slowly, then suddenly. Liquidity is cleared, demand is active, and patience gets rewarded.” Price Trading Around $1.28 Altcoinpedia outlined that SUI is currently trading around $1.28, which serves as the anchor for near-term market analysis. The price structure indicates ongoing consolidation above support near $1.50, while resistance is observed around $2.00. This setup reflects a tightening range as buyers and sellers balance, suggesting that a decisive move could be approaching. Related Reading: Sui Restores Service After Major 6-Hour Outage Shook Network Price oscillation within this range highlights that sustained volume expansion above $2.00 could drive the next leg of the trend toward $2.50. Conversely, failure to break this resistance, particularly with shrinking volume, increases the likelihood of a retest of support at $1.50. Should that level fail to hold, price could decline further toward $1.20. Momentum currently resides in a neutral state, reflecting indecision in the market. In a bullish scenario, a clean break above $2.00, confirmed by momentum indicators, would signal trend continuation. On the downside, a breach of support under heavy volume could accelerate selling pressure and confirm a bearish scenario. Traders are advised to use key range boundaries for entries and exits, managing risk around both support and resistance levels. For longer-term investors, it is prudent to wait for a decisive breakout from the current consolidation, which would provide a clearer signal for trend direction and reduce the risk of false moves within the neutral range.

    "title": "Here’s Why Bitcoin Fall Below $80,000 Could Be A Deep Pit – Analyst",
    "body": "In the past few hours, Bitcoin has dropped below $80,000 amid another wave of liquidations as January comes to a rather volatile close. Analysts at Kobeissi note there have been three notable liquidation events in the past 12 hours, resulting in a combined loss of $1.3 billion. Such developments, coupled with a very fearful market after last week’s price slump, have pushed Bitcoin below a key price level. According to the renowned market expert Burak Kesmeci, Bitcoin’s behavior towards this $80,000 price zone holds significant consequences for the market trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio Spikes To New High — Fresh Volatility Ahead? Bitcoin Slips Under ETF Realized Price As Downside Risk Grows In a recent X post, Burak Kesmeci outlines the technical and on-chain importance of the $80,000 price level to the Bitcoin market. Before Bitcoin’s recent breakdown below $80,000, the asset had twice retested this zone following the correction phase that began in early October 2025. Each successful rebound from these retests reinforced $80,000 as a critical support level, with certain chart formations even hinting at potential trend reversal. This underscored the market’s technical sensitivity to this level before the recent loss. However, Kesmeci highlights an on-chain importance of the $80,000 price point in that it also functions as the cost basis of the Bitcoin Spot ETFs. Therefore, the recent price fall below $80,000 places a large cohort of institutional investors at risk of entering unrealized losses. In January 2026 alone, the Bitcoin ETFs already witnessed massive levels of withdrawals, resulting in a total net outflow of $1.61 billion. However, these figures are likely to surge higher as sustained price decline below the ETF cost basis is expected to trigger a wide-scale, panic-driven redemption among investors. In addition to its on-chain and technical importance, Kesmeci also notes that $80,000 presently functions as the True Market Mean. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy Signal For XRP On Key Price Condition – Analyst What Next For Bitcoin? According to Burak Kesmeci, a bearish scenario would require a weekly close below the $80,000 support level. If confirmed, the analyst warns that bearish momentum could intensify, potentially driving Bitcoin lower toward $72,000, $68,000, and eventually $62,000 in sequence. This is because these levels align with notable volume profile clusters, representing potential areas where liquidity could accumulate, and the price may temporarily stabilize. Conversely, in a bullish scenario, Kesmeci notes that a sustained rebound from current levels could shift momentum back in favor of the bulls. The first major upside hurdle lies at $90,000, followed by the 111-period Simple Moving Average (SMA111) near $95,000, which is described as a critical level for confirming a medium-term trend reversal. A decisive break above the psychological $100,000 resistance would further strengthen the bullish case and signal a potential resumption of the broader uptrend. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $77,832, reflecting a 7.1% loss in the past day. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview",

    "title": "Bitcoin Air Pocket Presents Potential Fall To $73,000 – Details",
    "body": "Bitcoin bearish sentiments continue to dominate the market, after prices fell below the key $80,000 on January 31, resulting in a new wave of market liquidations. Interestingly, a pseudonymous analyst with the username CryptoMe has identified an “air pocket” in the present price structure, which potentially points to the downside target of this recent price drop. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adjusted SOPR Shows Market At Pivotal Junction — What’s Next? Bitcoin Now Below $80K Support Zone – What Next? In a QuickTake post on January 31, CryptoMe draws attention to an existing price vacuum between $73,000 – $80,000 as confirmed by three different market metrics. This observation is important in anticipating Bitcoin downside targets, considering the presently heightened market fears following the latest price decline. According to CryptoMe, liquidity levels on the Binance spot order book showed a concentration of limit buy orders between $73,000 – $80,000 that formed between late October and early November. Despite the price surge from $80,000 to around $100,000 seen in late Q4 2025, the liquidity cluster price zone remained untouched. Therefore, the zone is likely to act as a short-term price magnet should bearish momentum persist, as markets often gravitate toward areas of unfilled liquidity during periods of heightened volatility. Another on-chain metric that supports the existence of an air pocket between $73,000 – $80,000 is the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) price histogram. Each Bitcoin transaction consumes existing UTXOs and creates new ones; therefore, UTXOs are a good measure of on-chain transaction activity. As seen in the chart above, the sparse UTXO density between $73,000 and $80,000 suggests that a small number of transactions occurred within this price range. Thus, investors failed to establish a cost basis that would prevent further price decline, as prices have now slipped below $80,000. The final metric highlighted by CryptoMe is the Spot ETF Investor Average Cost, which currently stands at $79,000. Following the launch of the Bitcoin Spot ETFs in January 2024, Bitcoin has failed to trade below its realized price until now. Considering all three metrics, it’s likely that Bitcoin is headed for the $73,000 price mark, which the market has not visited since April 2025. Moreover, such a decline would represent a 40% devaluation from the present market all-time high.

    "title": "Bitcoin LTH Supply Rises Again Amid Bearish Market Dynamics",
    "body": "The Bitcoin market experienced a shockingly dramatic weekend, as opposed to the typical silent price action displayed in previous weekends. On Saturday, January 31st, the world’s leading cryptocurrency seemingly led other crypto assets south of the charts, with its price falling from $84,350 to as low as $75,000 in a single swoop. As this unfolded, an inversely correlated shift also played out underneath the charts. A recent on-chain evaluation has pointed out that Bitcoin’s Long-term Holder behavior is changing, contrary to what its short-term holders are doing. Long-Term Holders Accumulate As Short-Term Supply Declines Pseudonymous on-chain analyst Darkfost recently took to CryptoQuant, via a Quicktake post, pointing out that Bitcoin’s long-term holders are racking up more BTC. The relevant indicator here is the LTH supply change (Coinbase fix). Related Reading: Rising Above The Ashes: XRP ETFs Set New Record Despite Market Crash For context, this metric tracks the net change in the amount of Bitcoin held by long-term holders (typically coins unmoved for ~155 days). According to the analyst, approximately 186,000 (on a monthly average) have been added to the Long-term holders’ supply. Seeing as more coins are aging past 155 days, Darkfost implied that short-term holder supply is, in turn, witnessing steady contraction. Notably, the analyst pointed out this kind of transition (between long-term and short-term investors) last happened in April, as the Bitcoin price retraced. As it is intuitively evident, a rising LTH supply is typically interpreted as growing conviction among Bitcoin’s long-term investors. By extension, this means that long-term holders are distributing less of their holdings and stowing away more. In theory, this behavior is bullish news for the cryptocurrency. This is because, as LTHs absorb supply, the amount of available Bitcoin for sale reduces. Historically, it is also a bullish signal for the BTC price, as it has often appeared during the early stages of accumulation periods or late into correction stages. However, the broader market implications in the current context might not be so favorable. Darkfost highlighted that there is very weak demand available to cushion the falling BTC price. At the same time, the Bitcoin market appears to be entering a bearish phase; hence, it is not far-fetched to see major capitulation events in the near-term. If this happens, the Bitcoin price would likely plummet, as weaker investors may sell off their holdings in fear or as victims of liquidation events. For a bullish outlook to be truly relevant, there has to be a clear recovery in demand, alongside continued long-term holder accumulation. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of press time, the Bitcoin price stands at approximately $78,060, reflecting a 6.9% loss in the past day.
