    "title": "Bitcoin Faces Elevated Downside Risk: Loss Selling Takes Hold As STH SOPR Falls Below 1",
    "body": "Bitcoin has been under intense selling pressure in recent sessions, leaving market participants increasingly cautious about near-term direction. On Wednesday, BTC briefly surged from the $86,000 area toward $90,000, offering short-term investors a moment of relief after weeks of downside volatility. That rebound, however, proved short-lived. Price quickly retraced back to the $86,000 level, once again stalling bullish momentum and reinforcing the perception that sellers remain firmly in control. Related Reading: From Cycles To Continuity: Why Bitcoin’s 4-Year Pattern May Be Breaking This failed recovery attempt has weighed heavily on sentiment, particularly among short-term holders who entered positions at higher levels during the previous consolidation range. According to a report by Axel Adler, on-chain data reveals that this cohort has entered a clear stress regime. Bitcoin’s price has fallen below the average purchase price of short-term holders, a condition that historically increases the probability of reactive selling behavior. The stress is further reflected in the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR, 30-day), which has declined to 0.98. This reading indicates that short-term holders are, on average, realizing losses when they sell. Such environments often coincide with deteriorating confidence and heightened sensitivity to further downside moves. With BTC unable to hold recent relief rallies and short-term participants increasingly underwater, the market enters a fragile phase. The coming days will be critical in determining whether this pressure evolves into deeper capitulation or stabilizes into a base-building process. Short-Term Holders Under Stress as Loss-Taking Accelerates Adler explains that the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR 30D) is a critical gauge of short-term market stress, as it measures whether recent coin sales are occurring at a profit or a loss. Values above one indicate that short-term holders are selling profitably, while readings below one signal loss realization. Historically, sustained periods below one reflect deteriorating confidence and raise the risk of further downside, as loss-taking behavior can cascade into additional sell pressure. A continued decline in SOPR would likely intensify this dynamic and open the door to new local lows. By contrast, a meaningful recovery would require the metric to reclaim and hold above the one level, signaling that selling pressure is being absorbed and losses are no longer dominant. This stress is reinforced by the Short-Term Holders Positive vs Negative Sentiment chart. The indicator classifies holders based on whether they are in profit or at a loss. Over the past five weeks, sentiment has shifted decisively toward the orange and purple zones, representing negative positioning. The growing dominance of underwater holders increases the probability of panic-driven selling. Together, both charts deliver a consistent message: short-term participants are under pressure, and the current environment remains fragile until clear signs of relief emerge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Structure Turns Bearish As Structural Indicators Flip Negative Bitcoin Tests Critical Support as Bears Persist Bitcoin continues to trade under pressure, with the chart showing price consolidating around the $87,000 area after a sharp corrective move from the October highs near $125,000. The rejection from the upper range marked a clear shift in market structure, as BTC lost the 50-day and 100-day moving averages and failed to reclaim them on subsequent rebounds. The blue moving average has now turned downward, reinforcing the short- to medium-term bearish bias. Price is currently hovering just above the 200-day moving average, plotted in red, which sits near the $86,000–$88,000 zone. This level represents a critical area of long-term demand and structural support. Historically, sustained closes below the 200-day average tend to coincide with deeper corrective phases or prolonged consolidation. Related Reading: XRP Liquidity Dries Up: Futures Buy Volume On Binance Falls from $5.8B to $250M Volume dynamics add to the cautious outlook. Selling pressure expanded significantly during the breakdown in October and November, while recent rebound attempts have occurred on relatively muted volume. This suggests that short-covering and tactical buying, rather than strong spot demand, are driving price stabilization. Structurally, Bitcoin is forming lower highs since the peak, keeping the broader trend vulnerable. A recovery scenario would require BTC to reclaim the $95,000–$100,000 region and hold above the declining moving averages. Until then, the chart favors continued consolidation or further downside risk around the long-term support zone. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Gold and silver hit fresh highs on Tuesday while Bitcoin slid back under $89,000, sending a clear message that some investors are favoring metal over riskier bets. Related Reading: Russia Rejects Crypto As Legal Tender, Finance Official Confirms According to Reuters and market data, gold traded above $4,330 an ounce and silver pushed past $66 an ounce in what market participants called a strong run for bullion. Reports have disclosed that silver’s rally has lifted local prices in India to about ₹2.06 lakh per kilogram. Metals Rally, Hit New Highs Silver’s advance has been dramatic. It is up roughly 120-130% year-to-date, a jump that outpaces gold by a wide margin. Traders point to a mix of stronger industrial demand from solar and electronics, tighter supplies, and flows into safe assets as reasons behind the move. Gold buyers have also been encouraged by signs that US inflation may cool and by shifting expectations for central bank policy, which tends to support non-yielding assets when real yields fall. JUST IN 🚨: Silver soars to $66 for the first time in history 📈🥳🫂 pic.twitter.com/YGCrB5VDPH — Barchart (@Barchart) December 17, 2025 Safe Haven Demand And Industrial Use Some investors are treating metals as a hedge. Others want exposure linked to real economy needs. Both forces are at work. Analysts say silver’s dual role — as an industrial metal and as a store of value — is amplifying moves. Energy prices and supply reports have added pressure on markets, and that has upped demand for physical metal in several trading hubs. Bitcoin Slips Under Key Level Bitcoin fell below $89,000 and was trading nearer to $88,450 in mid-session, giving back gains from earlier months. Based on reports and market feeds, BTC is about 7% lower year-to-date and roughly 30% below its October 2025 peak above $126,000. Some crypto funds recorded outflows recently, and several traders described market tone as risk-off, which has weighed on digital assets this week. Liquidity, ETF Flows And Sentiment ETF flows played a role. Where money leaves ETFs, prices can feel the impact quickly. Margin calls, profit taking after a volatile run, and investors moving to what they see as safer stores of value have all been cited by sources watching the tape. Technical levels near $84,000 to $85,000 are now being watched for support, while resistance sits close to $90,000 to $92,000. Related Reading: 5,606 Bitcoin: Lightning Network Sets Fresh Capacity Record Markets Eye Data And Policy Moves Economic reports and central bank signals are next on traders’ calendars. US inflation prints and comments from global central banks have been flagged as possible triggers for fresh moves in both metals and crypto. Investors also noted that equity weakness, especially in some large tech names, has nudged money toward hard assets and away from riskier positions. Several market strategists said that policy shifts overseas, including from the Bank of Japan, could further change global liquidity and investor choices.

    "body": "As the market volatility continues, Bitcoin (BTC) has failed to hold its short-lived momentum and reclaim a key resistance level for the second time this week. Some market watchers have affirmed that the flagship crypto may continue to have a disappointing end-of-year rally and potentially reach new lows before the pain is over. Related Reading: Did Crypto Investors Stop Believing In The Four-Year Cycle? Analyst Weighs In New Lows Before A 2026 Recovery? On Thursday, Bitcoin attempted to break past a crucial level after surging 2.9% from its daily opening. The cryptocurrency has been unable to reclaim $89,000-$90,000 area since the start-of-week correction, which sent the price to a two-week low of $85,145. Notably, the flagship crypto retested the crucial resistance area twice in the past 24 hours but has been rejected, falling back to the local lows. Market observer Ted Pillows highlighted that BTC has been holding above the $85,000 support zone despite the volatility, which could lead to another retest of the key $90,000-$92,000 zone if it holds. However, if price break below local support zone, Bitcoin would likely see a retest of the November lows, around the $80,000 mark. Ted also pointed out that the cryptocurrency may be mirroring its Q1 2025 price action, which suggests that a price drop below the recent lows could happen. Per the chart, BTC briefly bounced in March from its early 2025 correction before recording a lower low in the next few weeks. This was then followed by the Q2 and Q3 recovery rallies that propelled the price to its latest all-time high (ATH) of $126,000. Now, Bitcoin displays a similar performance, currently recovering from the initial corrective phase. If history repeats, the flagship crypto could see a 10%-15% drop to the $74,000-$76,000 area in the coming weeks before kicking off a rally toward new highs in 2026, the analyst suggested. Bitcoin To Continue With ‘No Direction’ Similarly, Ali Martinez affirmed that the cryptocurrency is at an inflection point and risks dropping up to 20% if the $87,000 support doesn’t hold. He explained that BTC is breaking out of a bear flag, which could target the $70,000 level if selling pressure spikes. Meanwhile, another analyst considers that “sentiment [is] flipping based on every last daily candle colour.” Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that Bitcoin has been trading within the $84,000-$93,500 for the past four weeks, “moving up and down in a choppy fashion, while trading in between these two larger levels.” To the trader, the next few weeks will continue to be “generally very choppy and lack direction” due to lower liquidity and trading volume during the holiday season. “I don’t think you’d be missing much if you log off and come back somewhere early January,” he added. Related Reading: XRP Price Must Defend This Level To Avoid 50% Breakdown, Analyst Warns On the contrary, analyst Crypto Jelle affirmed that despite the low-timeframe struggles, Bitcoin “still flat out refuses to drop lower, no matter how hard bears try.” He noted that price still sits “on a clear weekly support level” that has held since April, explaining that as long as this area holds, price can still reclaim the monthly opening, around the $90,300 area. As of this writing, BTC trades at $86,138 a 5.3% decline in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Crypto payment platform MoonPay is poised to receive a significant fundraising boost as recent reports suggest that Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is exploring an investment in the company. According to a Bloomberg report, which cited sources familiar with the discussions, MoonPay is close to finalizing this fundraising round and is targeting a valuation around $5 billion. New Regulatory Approval And Investment Talks Based in New York, MoonPay specializes in simplifying the trading of cryptocurrencies through various payment methods, including PayPal, Apple Pay, and Venmo. The platform also offers tools for users to send, receive, and manage stablecoins. Notably, MoonPay recently obtained a Limited Purpose Trust Charter from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), a significant regulatory approval that complements its existing BitLicense. Related Reading: Bitwise’s 2026 Crypto Forecast: Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Poised For New Record Highs This charter enables MoonPay to expand its custody and other crypto services within New York, placing the company in league with established players like Coinbase (COIN) and PayPal, which also operate under the state’s strict digital asset regulations. The momentum for MoonPay continues to build, particularly with news that Caroline Pham, the acting chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), plans to join the firm as its chief legal and administrative officer. CFTC Chair Caroline Pham to Join MoonPay Pham has been a notable figure in the regulatory landscape, having served on the CFTC’s board since April 2022 and becoming acting chair in January 2025. She announced her intention to return to the private sector once a permanent chair was confirmed, which is expected to happen this week with Mike Selig’s anticipated confirmation. Under Pham’s leadership, the CFTC expedited several initiatives focused on cryptocurrencies, including the allowance for spot crypto trading on futures exchanges and the launch of a digital assets pilot program permitting the use of assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in derivatives markets. Additionally, Pham implemented various operational changes within the CFTC, reportedly leading to nearly $50 million in annual savings by enhancing governance and accountability. Related Reading: Optimism Grows In Crypto Market Structure Bill After Wednesday’s Senate Banking Meeting Pham articulated that her agenda as acting chair concentrated on executing a range of presidential executive orders aimed at promoting regulatory clarity and efficiency across government agencies. Reflecting on her decision to join MoonPay, she emphasized the importance of people in her career choices, stating that meaningful connections guide her decisions. Her connection to MoonPay began through a dinner hosted by Christie’s Art + Tech in 2023, where she met MoonPay’s president, Keith Grossman. A conversation that started at the dinner evolved into a friendship and later professional discussions as Pham considered her options post-government. Grossman expressed confidence in Pham’s capabilities, stating, “MoonPay has really matured, and Caroline is the exact type of leader with the exact type of big bank and regulatory experience that’s needed for us to be able to move to the next level.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Solana (SOL) Support Shattered, Potential $100 Test Looms, Says Analyst",
    "body": "Solana (SOL) is currently one of the poorest performers among the top ten largest cryptocurrencies in the market, experiencing a sharp 13% decline over the past week. Bearish Patterns Emerge For Solana This downturn comes as the cryptocurrency has broken below the critical support level of $120, which had acted as a pivotal floor since the start of the month and previously prevented further drops. The situation appears even more dire for investors with bullish sentiments, as recent data from CoinGecko indicates that Solana has retraced nearly 60% from its all-time high of $293, reached back in January of this year. Year-to-date, the token has experienced a significant loss of 40%, which raises additional concerns among top analysts about its near-term stability. Related Reading: Optimism Grows In Crypto Market Structure Bill After Wednesday’s Senate Banking Meeting Experts are cautioning that unless conditions change, the Solana price may soon retest the $100 mark—an area not seen since April. Should this scenario materialize, it would imply an additional drop of approximately 15.9%. Some analysts, like market commentator EddieTradezz, have pointed to a bearish “head and shoulders” pattern formed in SOL’s daily chart, suggesting that Solana is on the brink of a substantial decline. He notes that it is now breaking through strong long-term resistance, with April’s lows around $95 potentially being a more realistic target than $100. Adding to the bearish sentiment, fellow expert ColdBloodShill has indicated that Solana may be heading toward a price point of $80, which would result in a drastic additional drop of 32%. However, as EddieTradezz mentioned, the possibility for recovery would largely depend on market-wide conditions and investor sentiment. Institutional Interest Grows As SOL ETFs See Major Inflows Despite the prevailing bearish indicators, there has been a noteworthy development on the institutional front. Recently approved Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US have seen impressive uptake, amassing $63.9 million in net inflows over the past week. This suggests that institutions are beginning to accumulate Solana, potentially viewing it as a long-term investment opportunity. However, this positive news has been overshadowed by heavy selling pressure in spot markets. Related Reading: Bitwise’s 2026 Crypto Forecast: Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Poised For New Record Highs Increased volatility has led to a rise in liquidations for leveraged positions, dampening Solana’s price reaction to the overall positive developments in institutional interest. Ultimately, Solana’s future remains uncertain. While institutional interest may offer some hope, the immediate outlook is clouded by increased selling pressure and the inability to regain capital in the broader market, which has recently dropped below the $2.90 trillion mark in total market capitalization.

Related Reading: UK Crypto Ownership Takes Biggest Hit Since 2021, Regulator Says Developers Call Threat Distant According to Bitcoin developer Adam Back of Blockstream, quantum machines remain far from able to break Bitcoin’s protections. He said the tech is still “ridiculously early” and that research hurdles persist. Back expects no real threat within the next decade and argued that even if parts of Bitcoin’s cryptography were compromised, the network would not automatically be emptied. Security, he noted, does not rest solely on encryption in a way that would allow mass theft on the blockchain. i think the risks are short term NIL. this whole thing is decades away, it’s ridiculously early and they have massive R&D issues in every vector of the required applied physics research to even find out if it’s possible at useful scale. but it’s ok to be “quantum ready” and — Adam Back (@adam3us) December 18, 2025 The Risk That Keeps Some Awake Other voices in the community disagree. Jameson Lopp, a well-known Bitcoin engineer, has warned about the worst-case outcome if quantum advances allowed attackers to break the ECDSA signature scheme that secures many wallets. In that scenario, forged signatures could be used to move funds, and user confidence might erode quickly. That warning has been repeated as a technical possibility, not as something imminent. How should we treat quantum vulnerable coins in a future where quantum computing becomes a threat? This panel from the Presidio Quantum Bitcoin Summit features myself, @theblackmarble, and @cryptoquick.https://t.co/jhr6hjLXru — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) September 14, 2025 Investors Worry, Capital Shifts Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, told observers that it is “extremely bearish” when influential developers appear to dismiss any quantum risk outright. He said the gap between investor concern and developer assessment is large. Reports have disclosed that some capital is being held back while large holders consider spreading risk into other assets. Craig Warmke of the Bitcoin Policy Institute added that perceived quantum risk has already pushed some holders to reduce their Bitcoin positions. Quantum risk is stemming the flow of capital into bitcoin, and encouraging large holders to diversify out of bitcoin. When non-technical people express concerns, they sometimes use technically incorrect language. It’s frustrating to see technical people dismiss concerns with an… https://t.co/MtSNY7Ivg3 — Craig Warmke (@craigwarmke) December 18, 2025 Current Technology Falls Short Most cryptographers agree quantum computers today are not powerful enough to crack Bitcoin’s cryptography. That assessment is widely reported by analysts who follow both fields. Metaculus’s median date for when quantum computers will break modern cryptography is 2040:https://t.co/Li8ni8A9Ox Seemingly about a 20% chance it will be before end of 2030. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) August 27, 2025 Still, the timeline is debated. Based on reports from researchers and public comments from industry figures like Vitalik Buterin, there is a measurable chance — about ~20% — that a machine capable of breaking today’s crypto could exist by 2030. That estimate has prompted calls for proactive steps. Related Reading: Trump-Linked World Liberty Backs USD1 With Treasury-Fueled Expansion Calls For Preparedness Grow Financial institutions and national programs, the reports say, are investing heavily in quantum work, and tools like AI are accelerating research in the field. As a result, many in the crypto world argue contingency plans should be ready well before any practical threat appears. Suggestions include moving to quantum-resistant signature schemes and improving wallet practices so funds are not left exposed while upgrades take place. Some experts point out that banks and other big targets may face attacks earlier, which could give the crypto sector time to respond. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "XRP Holders Are In For More Pain As There’s ‘Not A Single Support Holding’",
    "body": "XRP holders could be facing another prolonged stretch of downside pressure as the cryptocurrency continues to lose ground in a weakening market. XRP’s performance this period has been underwhelming enough that analysts have seemingly given up hope of the price challenging higher resistance levels in the near term. They revealed that XRP has slipped below key support zones, leaving few technical barriers to slow further declines. XRP Faces Further Decline As All Support Fails A crypto market analyst who goes by the name ‘Guy on the Earth’ on X has shared a rather bleak outlook on XRP’s near-term prospects. In his post on Thursday, the analyst revealed that XRP looks set for more pain as the market structure continues to deteriorate. He noted that price action is now threatening to lose its Descending Channel, signaling overall weakness rather than stabilization. Related Reading: Bitcoin Just Entered Extreme Oversold Levels And Analysts Predict New ATH Targets According to the expert, the probability of XRP reclaiming the $1.95 level by the weekly close is incredibly low. However, losing this consolidation range that has contained price since November 2024 opens the door to a technical downside target near $0.90. He also pointed out that a confirmation from the monthly timeframe aligns with the two-week chart, which is fast approaching its close in just a few days. Guy on the Earth stated there was little optimism left in the current price setup. He emphasized that no meaningful support levels are holding, and the market demand appears thin, leaving XRP vulnerable to continued selling pressure and potential declines. The analyst’s review of the cryptocurrency’s performance was blunt, suggesting that the market “is what it is” at this stage. Looking at the chart shared alongside the analysis, XRP is clearly trading within a well-defined downward channel that has guided price lower for several months now. Each bounce attempt has been capped by descending resistance, reinforcing the cryptocurrency’s bearish trend. Recent candles also show price drifting toward the lower boundary of the Descending Channel, increasing the risk of a correction. Momentum indicators at the bottom of the chart also reflect ongoing pressure. XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits near the lower end of its range, showing persistent weakness as price fails to recover. Related Reading: Ripple Goes Institutional: What The Doppler Finance And SBI Partnership Means For XRP Analyst Weighs Short-Term Hope For XRP When asked by a crypto community member if a daily close back inside the Descending Channel could temporarily save XRP from an extended downturn, Guy on the Earth acknowledged the possibility. He stated that such a move could help in the short term but described it as a “trivial” development compared to larger structural levels. The crypto analyst’s focus remains on the $1.95 level on the two-week close, highlighting it as the most critical area to watch. He pointed out that this structure has remained intact for the past 13 months, making it a defining support zone for XRP. While bouncing back to the channel would not erase the broader bearish trend, the expert revealed that it would at least suggest that XRP still has a chance to grow.

    "title": "Here’s How Much % Of Bitcoin Supply Is Currently Sitting In Losses",
    "body": "On-chain analytics platform Glassnode has revealed the number of Bitcoin supply that is currently sitting at a loss. This comes as the BTC price continues to trade below the psychological $90,000 level following its crash, which began last month. Here’s The Amount Of Bitcoin Supply At A Loss In a report, Glassnode revealed that the Bitcoin supply in loss has risen to 6.7 million BTC, marking the highest level of loss-bearing supply observed in this cycle. The analytics platform further noted that this represents 23.7% of the circulating supply, which is currently underwater. 10.2% of this supply is held by long-term holders and 13.5% by short-term holders. Related Reading: The Bearish Structure That Puts Bitcoin Price At $92,550, And Then $82,000 Glassnode stated that this distribution suggests that, much like in prior cycle transitions into deeper bearish regimes, the loss-bearing Bitcoin supply accumulated by recent buyers is gradually maturing into the long-term cohort. Meanwhile, the analytics platform noted that the 6-7 million range, which has been at a loss since mid-November, mirrors early transitional phases of prior cycles, where mounting investor frustration came before a shift toward more bearish conditions and intensified capitulation at lower Bitcoin prices. Notably, the Bitcoin price has dropped to levels last seen in 2024, erasing its year-to-date (YTD) gains. Glassnode stated that this has left behind a dense supply cluster accumulated by top buyers in the $93,000 to $120,000 range. The resulting supply distribution is said to reflect a top-heavy market structure where recovery attempts are capped by heavy overhead sell pressure, especially in the early stages of a bearish phase. Glassnode declared that as long as the Bitcoin price remains below this range and fails to reclaim key thresholds, most notably the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis at $101,500, the risk of further corrective downside persists. BTC Spot Demand Is Unstable Glassnode revealed that the Bitcoin spot market flows continue to reflect an uneven demand profile across major venues. The Cumulative Volume Delta bias is said to show periodic bursts of buy-side activity, but has failed to develop into sustained accumulation, especially during the recent BTC price pullbacks. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Down Today? BlackRock Deposits Spark Worry The on-chain analytics platform noted that the Coinbase spot CVD remains relatively constructive, indicating steadier participation from US-based investors. On the other hand, Binance and aggregate Bitcoin flows remain choppy and largely directionless. Glassnode stated that these dispersion points point to selective engagement rather than coordinated spot demand. Meanwhile, the platform alluded to recent Bitcoin price declines, which it pointed out have not triggered decisive expansion in positive CVD. Glassnode noted that this suggests dip-buying remains tactical and short-term. In the absence of sustained accumulation across all venues, Bitcoin’s price action continues to rely more on activity in the derivatives market and liquidity conditions rather than organic spot demand. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $86,800, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "Dogecoin is showing resilience at key support, with buyers repeatedly stepping in to absorb downside pressure. However, momentum indicators and the broader structure continue to favor the bears, keeping the short-term trend under stress. This tug-of-war sets the stage for a decisive move, as the next reaction will determine whether DOGE stabilizes or slides deeper. DOGE Stuck In A Prolonged Corrective Phase According to a recent update by More Crypto Online, Dogecoin’s price action remains stuck in a corrective phase that has been in place since November 2024. The sharp flash crash on October 10 added complexity to the broader structure, making the chart harder to interpret. However, the core scenarios outlined in earlier analyses are still valid, with the short-term trend clearly leaning to the downside. Related Reading: Fading ETF Interest Puts Pressure on Dogecoin as Price Approaches Critical Cost-Basis Zone Although the “yellow” scenario allows for the possibility of one more push higher, downside momentum is still currently in control. Until DOGE shows a decisive reaction at a major support level, or at least manages to stabilize before slipping below the 9.6-cent level that marks the October 10 low, further weakness should be expected. Initial support sits at 9.6 cents, followed by deeper levels at 8.0 cents and then 5.4 cents. Whether price eventually reaches these lower targets is still uncertain, but for now, there are no technical signals suggesting that a local bottom has formed. Overall momentum remains negative, with DOGE still trading within a local downtrend. While a bullish reversal could develop at some point, current conditions do not justify adopting a bullish bias. Trying to anticipate a reversal ahead of confirmation carries increased risk in this environment, making caution the prudent approach for now. Bears Press, But Dogecoin Refuses To Break Crypto analyst Broke Doomer revealed that DOGE is displaying significant resilience, as bears have attempted to push the price lower multiple times without success. Despite the persistent downward pressure, the price continues to hold its ground, suggesting that the current support level is much firmer than sellers anticipated. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Can Stage A 96% Rally If It Breaks This Falling Wedge Pattern The analyst noted that every dip into this specific zone is being bought up relatively quickly, a clear indication that strong bids are still stepping in whenever weakness is shown. This aggressive “buy-the-dip” behavior suggests that institutional or large-scale buyers are likely positioning themselves within this consolidation range, preventing a deeper breakdown. Given this ongoing battle between supply and demand, the focus has now shifted to the longevity of this base. Broke Doomer raised the question of how long this support will hold before buyers finally seize full control of the momentum. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "$2,500 Solana? Scaramucci Says The Setup Is Already In Motion",
    "body": "SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci said he still sees a path to Solana reaching $2,500 over a five-to-ten-year horizon, arguing that tokenization plus clearer US regulation could turn Solana into a core financial “rail system.” Scaramucci made the remarks in an interview with SolanaFloor filmed during last week’s Solana Breakpoint conference and released on Dec. 18. Why Solana Is Still Poised For $2,500 Scaramucci framed the $2,500 thesis as a long-duration bet that won’t play out cleanly. “It’s not going to come without… volatility,” he said, pointing to what he called a messy US regulatory year and sticky inflation as headwinds that “probably slowed down our trajectory.” “If you had asked me at the beginning of the year” whether Washington would pass stablecoin legislation and “the market structure, the CLARITY bill,” he said he would have expected both. “That did not happen.” Still, he argued “the timing is still right,” with the caveat that price will likely remain jumpy until those macro and regulatory variables resolve. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Support Shattered, Potential $100 Test Looms, Says Analyst To explain the patience required, Scaramucci leaned on a tech-investing analogy, recalling Amazon’s drawdowns by 90% before mass adoption. The lesson, in his words: stay with “great technology” through uncertain stretches because durable infrastructure eventually gets adopted. Asked what surprised him most this cycle, Scaramucci singled out the Trump and Melania memecoins. He described their Solana launch as “a compliment to Solana” because it was selected for “ability to handle large scale large volume transactions with great certainty and finality.” But he also argued the episode backfired on policy. “I think those coins slowed down the regulatory process in the US,” he said, suggesting that the optics of a US president entering the memecoin business created a political “foil” that opponents could use to resist crypto bills. “I think we would have gotten everything that we wanted this year had the president sort of stayed out of the meme coin business,” he added, calling it “short-term regulatory” damage. He also claimed the memecoin surge “sucked out all the liquidity from a lot of the altcoins,” which he said “hurt the industry,” even as it showcased Solana’s throughput. Tokenization Is The Endgame Scaramucci’s core argument was simple: tokenization is coming, and Solana is positioned to host a meaningful share of it. He said Paul Atkins, whom he described as a longtime personal friend, delivered what Scaramucci considers an underappreciated prediction: “In 5 years all of our assets are going to be tokenized.” Scaramucci then pushed his own conclusion: “What’s going to be the number one rail system to tokenize on? It’s going to be Solana.” He argued superior systems tend to win through adoption, not ideology. “If you have something that works better than something else, it gets adopted,” he said, comparing Solana’s trajectory to the internet’s jump from dial-up to today’s high-bandwidth reality. He also flagged operational progress on the network. “I don’t want to jinx us,” he said, but suggested Solana had gone “two years now without any” downtime. Related Reading: Solana Value Proposition Extends Beyond Tech Into Economic Infrastructure SolanaFloor challenged Scaramucci on why SkyBridge tokenized a $300 million fund on another chain. Scaramucci said it was “a very small fund,” and that a larger fund “will likely get tokenized on Solana.” He also rejected maximalism: “I don’t believe in chain monogamy,” he said. His view is that “three or four chains” will win, naming Solana and Avalanche. He argued Avalanche can be attractive for certain compliance-driven deployments, while Solana is where “stocks and bonds are going to be tokenized” and where “the larger funds are going to be tokenized.” Scaramucci also disclosed his personal positioning: “My largest personal position even greater than Bitcoin is my position in Solana and I have it all staked,” he said, adding he owns Avalanche and Bitcoin and holds a “very small position” in Ethereum. Scaramucci tied the next leg of the cycle to US policy and liquidity. If the US passes market-structure rules next year, he said, prices should respond. If inflation cools and the Fed can cut more aggressively under a new chair, he argued that would add liquidity and reinforce a “positive flywheel.” At press time, SOL traded at $125.

    "title": "Bitcoin Price Lags Network Utility: A Valuation Reset Is Underway",
    "body": "Bitcoin continues to struggle below the $90,000 level as volatility remains elevated and market conviction weakens. Short-term price swings have failed to establish a clear directional bias, reinforcing a broader sense of uncertainty among traders and investors. While price remains historically high, internal market conditions suggest that underlying stress is building beneath the surface, particularly within the mining sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Elevated Downside Risk: Loss Selling Takes Hold As STH SOPR Falls Below 1 A recent analysis by Axel Adler highlights growing pressure on Bitcoin miners using the Miner Financial Health Index, a composite metric that assesses mining profitability relative to price. Readings above 80% historically signal excessive profitability and late-cycle conditions, while levels below 20% indicate financial strain and elevated risk for miners. Currently, the index sits near 22%, once again approaching the Alert zone. This places miner profitability near one of its weakest levels since 2022, despite Bitcoin trading well above its summer 2022 price range. Similar conditions have typically appeared during post-correction phases or shortly after halving events, when revenue compression collides with high network difficulty. This divergence between elevated price levels and deteriorating miner fundamentals raises important questions about the sustainability of Bitcoin’s current structure as the market searches for its next equilibrium. Miner Economics Signal Growing Stress Beneath Bitcoin’s Price Adler’s analysis further examines the demand–supply balance within Bitcoin’s mining economics, offering deeper insight into why miner profitability continues to deteriorate. This index tracks the ratio of transaction fee revenue relative to new coin issuance, effectively measuring how much users are willing to pay for blockspace compared to the rate of supply expansion. Historically, readings above 70% indicate strong demand and a risk-on environment, while levels below 30% reflect structural weakness. Currently, the demand–supply balance sits near 38% on a 30-day average. While not yet in outright stress territory, the metric has declined steadily from local highs above 60%, placing it firmly in a neutral-weak zone. This trend suggests that organic demand for blockspace remains subdued, with users showing little urgency to outbid one another through higher fees. For a clear improvement in conditions, Adler notes that the index would need to reclaim levels above 50%, likely requiring a surge in transaction activity or a meaningful on-chain catalyst. This weakness is mirrored in absolute miner revenue. Bitcoin miner revenue, measured in US dollars and smoothed over seven days, has fallen to roughly $40 million after a recent peak. Although consistent with 2025 averages, this level remains well below revenue spikes seen during periods of heightened network activity. With difficulty remaining elevated, declining revenues amplify pressure on less efficient miners, reinforcing the stress signaled by both profitability and demand metrics.

BTC is currently trading around the $88,000 area following a rebound from recent lows, but the broader trend remains fragile. The selloff from the $120,000–$125,000 region marked a clear break in momentum, with price slicing below the short-term moving averages and triggering accelerated downside pressure. Notably, Bitcoin lost the daily 50-day and 100-day moving averages during the decline, confirming a shift toward a bearish short-term structure. While the 200-day moving average continues to trend higher and remains intact, price is now consolidating just below it, turning this level into a critical zone of resistance. As long as BTC fails to reclaim and hold above this long-term trend line, upside attempts are likely to face selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Structure Turns Bearish As Structural Indicators Flip Negative The sharp increase in sell volume during the breakdown contrasts with relatively muted buying volume on the rebound, suggesting that recent upside moves are corrective rather than impulsive. Structurally, Bitcoin is forming a lower-high pattern, which keeps downside risk elevated if support near $85,000–$86,000 fails. For bulls to regain control, BTC must reclaim the 200-day moving average and establish higher highs. Until then, the chart favors consolidation or further volatility rather than a sustained recovery.

    "title": "Ethereum Exchange Supply Just Crashed To New Lows, Why This Is Bullish For Price",
    "body": "CryptoQuant has released a new report, highlighting a significant shift in Ethereum’s exchange supply dynamics and institutional behavior. According to the data, the amount of ETH held on crypto exchanges has crashed to unexpected lows. The decline coincides with growing institutional accumulation, a trend often viewed as an early signal of a bullish price outlook. Ethereum Exchange Balances Fall To 2016 Lows Arab Chain, a crypto analyst on CryptoQuant, revealed that Ethereum’s exchange supply ratio across all tracked platforms has declined to approximately 0.137. According to the data referenced in the report, this represents one of the lowest readings observed since 2016. Related Reading: Ethereum 2-Year Trend Maps Out This Unique Crash Path To Bottom At $2,187 The analyst emphasized that this metric reflects the proportion of total ETH supply currently held on exchanges relative to the overall circulating supply. Lower levels of this metric reflect a smaller fraction of ETH ready for liquidation on exchanges, which the analyst identifies as an important factor in understanding market liquidity conditions. Arab Chain also noted that the sustained decline in this ratio indicates a continued outflow of ETH from centralized exchanges to external wallets. This movement suggests that a smaller portion of Ethereum’s supply is readily available for trading. It also signals growing confidence among holders who prefer long-term positioning over short-term speculation. From a broader market perspective, a shrinking exchange supply is often seen as bullish for prices due to basic supply-and-demand dynamics. When fewer coins are available to sell, even a slight increase in demand can push prices up, as buyers compete for a smaller pool of liquid ETH. Reduced liquidity can also limit the intensity of declines, as large sell orders become harder to execute without moving the market. In his report, Arab Chain references historical behaviour, illustrated by a chart showing the Ethereum supply ratio for all exchanges. The analyst noted that similar declines in exchange supply have occurred during periods of reaccumulation or in the lead-up to stable price movements following significant market volatility. Ethereum Supply On Binance Crashes Arab Chain has also shared insights on Ethereum’s supply on Binance. The analyst disclosed that ETH balances on the exchange have been steadily declining over the past few months. As one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, Binance’s reserve changes often reflect broader market sentiment. Related Reading: Why Did The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP Prices Crash, And Will It Continue? The CryptoQuant report highlights that the Exchange Supply Ratio on Binance has crashed to 0.0325, a relatively low level compared to previous months. This indicates a steady withdrawal of ETH from the crypto exchange, reducing the amount of tokens available for immediate spot market selling. Arab Chain suggested that the drop in Ethereum supply on Binance shows that traders are becoming more cautious. Rather than engaging in short-term trades, many appear to be holding ETH off exchanges due to ongoing market volatility and uncertainty. The analyst added that the falling supply, combined with ETH’s price stability, indicates lower selling pressure. It also signals that the market may be entering a new phase of liquidity absorption and repositioning. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",
