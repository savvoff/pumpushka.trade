    "title": "Ethereum ETFs Record Over $600M In Outflows — Warning Signal For Traders?",
    "body": "The price of Ethereum endured significant selling pressure over the past week, reflecting the current climate of the crypto market. The latest data shows that the spot US-based Ethereum ETFs (exchange-traded funds) did not have it any better, as significant capital flowed out of the market in the past week. Ethereum ETFs Weekly Outflow Exceeds $600 Million In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, market pundit CryptoOnchain revealed an overwhelming exodus of institutional capital from the Ethereum market. More specifically, the analyst highlighted that over $600 million in capital flowed out of the US-based spot Ethereum ETFs over the past week. The relevant indicator here is the ETH ETF Net Flow metric, which monitors the net movement of capital (in millions of USD) into or out of the Ethereum exchange-traded fund market. Related Reading: Why XRP Price Is Playing Catch-Up Despite Successful ETF Launch: Analyst BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (with the ticker ETHA) is the primary contributor to the massive outflows witnessed by the Ethereum ETFs in the past week. CryptoQuant’s data shows that about $470 million in value was withdrawn from ETHA in the last trading week. Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (ticker: FETH) also registered a notable amount in net outflows, as around $35 million was withdrawn by investors. Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF (ETHE) also posted significant net outflows of approximately $49 million in the past week. What The Outflow Means For Ethereum Price In normal conditions, the Ethereum ETFs tend to provide substantial price stability and institutional support for the ETH price. However, these products could also be a source of immense volatility for the market, depending on their investor behavior. Typically, waves of ETF outflows indicate a reduction in institutional risk appetite for Ethereum. CryptoOnchain explained that when the week begins with reduced exposure from institutional participants, their not-so-optimistic sentiment becomes apparent in the market, as price nosedives, too. The lack of institutional demand could, in turn, make it difficult for Ethereum to defend its immediate support levels. Moreover, this could mean that institutional interest sits at price levels further south of the Ethereum price. This creates a vacuum of demand beneath the current price levels, which short-term traders in general may have trouble filling. Until ETF flows begin ascending towards positive values, the Ethereum market could be in for more bearish pressure. It, then, becomes very likely that the ‘king of altcoins’ would revisit lower support levels. Hence, it is important that investors involve themselves in the market with utmost caution. As of press time, Ethereum is valued at approximately $2,975, with no significant price movement in the past day.

    "title": "Whale Inflows Dampen XRP ETF Optimism As Selling Pressure Persists",
    "body": "Expectations around XRP exchange-traded funds were seen as a turning point that could unlock new institutional demand and change XRP’s price structure in favor of buyers. However, recent on-chain data suggests the price response has diverged immensely from that narrative. Metrics tracked by the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant point to a very different dynamic unfolding beneath the surface, one that explains why the altcoin continues to struggle for traction despite headline optimism and inflows into Spot XRP ETFs. Related Reading: Banks Could Favor A Higher XRP Price, Finance Expert Says Whale Exchange Inflows Expose Supply Pressure Data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant reveals an interesting trend among XRP whale addresses and their activity on crypto exchange Binance. A closer look at the Binance Inflow-Value Band chart shows that recent XRP deposits to exchanges are overwhelmingly concentrated in the 100,000 to 1 million XRP range and transactions exceeding 1 million coins. These are not retail-sized movements. They reflect activity from large holders moving significant balances onto exchanges, and this behavior aligns with distribution or preparation for selling. The chart showing the exchange inflow into Binance makes this pattern clear, with repeated inflow spikes driven almost entirely by these higher-value bands, while smaller transaction sizes are comparatively lower. The chart image below shows inflows in chunks between 100,000 XRP and 1 million XRP in purple and inflows of chunks more than 1 million XRP in light blue. Most of the inflows into Binance in the past few days have been characterized by these two cohorts, with a few instances of inflows in chunks between 10,000 XRP and 100,000 XRP. XRP Ledger: Exchange Inflow Value Bands – Binance. Source: CryptoQuant This imbalance means that supply is being added to the market by whales at a pace that smaller buyers cannot absorb, and this is why inflows into Spot XRP ETFs have failed to have a positive effect on the altcoin’s price action. Lower Highs, Lower Lows Confirm Supply Overpowering Demand As shown in the price action overlaid in the chart above, the coin printed repeatedly lower highs and lower lows after major exchange deposits. This happens because of the relatively low numbers of new spot buyers on Binance, and even moderate selling pressure has been enough to cap rallies. As it stands, the crypto is facing selling pressure every time it approaches $1.95. Based on the intensity of exchange inflows and the market’s reaction, the first meaningful support zone is between $1.82 and $1.87. However, if large inflows persist, the data suggests the XRP price could continue declining to the $1.50 to $1.66 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Feels The Weight Of Quantum Risk Concerns, Industry Leaders Warn The interpretation is that the ETF trend did not translate into sustained spot demand for XRP. Instead, whales who accumulated XRP ahead of ETF approval expectations appear to have used the resulting attention as an opportunity to dump their holdings. That said, inflows into Spot XRP ETFs may have helped limit deeper downside, as data from SoSoValue shows these funds recorded $82.04 million in inflows over the recent week.

Ethereum started a decent upward move above the $2,950 zone. The price is trading above $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $2,920 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above the $3,050 zone. Ethereum Price Eyes More Gains Ethereum price started a decent increase from $2,775, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to surpass the $2,850 and $2,880 resistance levels to enter a positive zone. The bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,175 swing high to the $2,775 low. Moreover, there was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $2,920 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . If there is another upward move, the price could face resistance near the $3,020 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,175 swing high to the $2,775 low. The next key resistance is near the $3,050 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,080 level. A clear move above the $3,080 resistance might send the price toward the $3,150 resistance. An upside break above the $3,150 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,220 resistance zone or even $3,250 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,050 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,950 level. The first major support sits near the $2,915 zone. A clear move below the $2,915 support might push the price toward the $2,880 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,840 region. The next key support sits at $2,800. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.
