    "title": "Ethereum Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech",
    "body": "According to reports, Vitalik Buterin has pulled 16,384 ETH from his reserves and plans to spend it on privacy and truly open technology. That move is paired with a call for five years of thrift at the Ethereum Foundation so the foundation can keep building core software while staying healthy for the long run. Related Reading: Gold, Silver Steal The Spotlight As Crypto Hype Fades On Social Media: Santiment A New Focus On Privacy And Openness Reports say the funds, worth about $45 million, will back a broad list of projects: open silicon, secure hardware, private messaging, local-first operating systems, and tools that mix zero-knowledge proofs with other privacy tools like FHE and differential privacy. He has already put money toward encrypted messaging and air quality work, and some new efforts aim to make secure hardware more affordable and verifiable. The plan covers both pieces of tech and the systems people run on them. Simple apps for daily life are included, not just fancy research. In these five years, the Ethereum Foundation is entering a period of mild austerity, in order to be able to simultaneously meet two goals: 1. Deliver on an aggressive roadmap that ensures Ethereum’s status as a performant and scalable world computer that does not compromise on… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 30, 2026 Personal Money For Public Good Buterin is taking on what might once have been “special projects” of the foundation. He withdrew the ETH personally, and reports note he is looking at secure, decentralized staking to route future staking rewards into these efforts. That shifts some financial risk from institutions to an individual who wants those projects to survive even when they are slow or controversial. Some of the initiatives are unlikely to attract fast capital. That is why personal backing matters. A Stronger Core, Not Bigger Hype The Foundation is said to be entering a phase of mild austerity so it can meet two clear goals at once: finish an aggressive technical roadmap and remain alive and independent into the far future. The technical aim is to keep Ethereum fast and scalable without losing decentralization or security. At the same time, the team wants to protect users’ ability to control their keys, their data, and their privacy. Reports note that “Ethereum for people who need it” is the guiding line, rather than chasing large corporate deals that transform how people use the chain.

    "title": "Avalanche (AVAX) Defies Bear Market With Explosive On‑Chain Growth, Messari",
    "body": "A newly released report from crypto market intelligence firm Messari offers a detailed look at Avalanche’s (AVAX) performance during the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2025, revealing a sharp contrast between weak price action and record‑breaking on‑chain activity. Metrics Climb Even As AVAX Suffers Steep Q4 Decline According to Messari, Avalanche’s native token, AVAX, experienced a steep decline during the final quarter of the year. The token fell 59.0% quarter‑over‑quarter (QoQ) and 65.5% year‑over‑year (YoY), dropping from around $30.00 at the end of Q3 in September to approximately $12.30 by the close of Q4. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slides Toward $85,000 Despite Progress On US Crypto Market Structure Bill Avalanche’s circulating market capitalization mirrored that drop, falling 58.3% QoQ and 63.9% YoY from $12.7 billion to $5.3 billion. Yet, the decline in valuation also impacted Avalanche’s relative standing among digital assets. AVAX slipped from 14th to 21st place in rankings by circulating market cap over the quarter. Despite this, Messari highlighted that network usage continued to expand, effectively breaking the typical link between token price performance and network fees. While total fees measured in US dollars declined 11.7% QoQ, that drop was modest compared with the 59.0% fall in AVAX’s price. In native terms, fees paid on the network increased meaningfully. Fees denominated in AVAX rose 24.9% QoQ, climbing from 105,719 AVAX to 132,016 AVAX. Average daily transactions on the C‑Chain jumped 63% to 2.1 million, while a wave of liquidations during the market crash on October 10, 2025, generated $520,715 in transaction fees. Messari noted that this was the highest single‑day fee total recorded on Avalanche since February 2024. Avalanche Sees Record Transaction And User Activity Looking more broadly, Avalanche’s ecosystem reached new activity highs in Q4 2025. Aggregate usage across the C‑Chain and all Avalanche Layer‑1 networks accelerated sharply. Average daily transactions increased 4.5% QoQ and surged 1,162.1% YoY to 38.2 million. At the same time, average daily active addresses climbed 25.1% QoQ and an extraordinary 16,360.3% YoY, reaching 24.7 million. Activity on the C‑Chain alone reached historic levels. Average daily transactions rose 69.0% QoQ and 799.3% YoY, making Q4 2025 the busiest quarter on record for the chain. Staking metrics, however, reflected the pressure from falling prices. The total USD value of staked AVAX declined 59.9% QoQ and 69.1% YoY to $2.3 billion, largely tracking the token’s price drop. Rising DeFi Base And Major RWA Growth Avalanche’s decentralized finance ecosystem also continued to evolve despite market headwinds. Messari reported that the DeFi Diversity Score, which measures how many protocols account for 90% of total value locked, rose 5.9% QoQ and 63.6% YoY, increasing from 17.0 to 18.0. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Begins To Rise, Raising Early Bear Market Concerns Total DeFi TVL across Avalanche L1s and the C‑Chain declined 41.9% QoQ and 3.8% YoY, falling from $2.2 billion to $1.3 billion. At the same time, the network’s stablecoin market cap grew modestly, increasing 1.7% QoQ and 24.3% YoY to $1.8 billion. As seen in the chart above, measured in AVAX rather than dollars, native DeFi TVL rose 34.5% QoQ to 97.5 million AVAX, even as USD‑denominated TVL fell 44.9%. Messari explained that this divergence occurred because AVAX’s price declined faster than the underlying value held within DeFi protocols. One of the strongest areas of growth for Avalanche in Q4 was real‑world assets (RWAs). RWA TVL jumped 68.6% QoQ and 949.3% YoY, rising from $789.8 million at the end of Q3 to $1.33 billion by the close of Q4 2025. Featured image from OpenArt, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin To $30,000? Analysts Warn BTC Crash Could Be Deeper Than Expected",
    "body": "After bouncing 2.6% from recent lows, Bitcoin (BTC) has been attempting to turn the $82,000-$83,000 area into support. Some analysts have warned that the cryptocurrency must hold the crucial macro support levels or it will “confirm bearish acceleration.” Related Reading: Ethereum Drops Below $2,800 As Crypto Liquidations Near $1B – Should Investors Worry? Bitcoin To Drop 76% From its Peak On Thursday, Bitcoin crashed alongside the rest of the market, retracing nearly 9% in a day toward the $81,314 area. BTC had been trading between $86,000-$93,500 since early November, closing above the lower boundary of its two-month range in the weekly timeframe despite constant volatility. At the moment, the flagship cryptocurrency has lost this key support in the daily timeframe and risks a deeper correction if the price doesn’t recover the $86,000 level before the end of the week. As the price hovers between levels not seen since the late November correction, a market observer has warned that the leading cryptocurrency has lost its 100-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as support. Ted Pillows asserted that the last two times Bitcoin had a weekly close below the 100-week EMA, back in 2018 and 2022, it dropped 50% in just 4-6 weeks. Moreover, he highlighted BTC’s historical pattern, noting that the cryptocurrency has repeated a similar performance between the 2017-2018 and 2021-2022 cycles. The chart shows an eight-year ascending trendline that has marked the top of the previous cycles. The trendline began during the late 2017 peak and continued into the next bull market, marking the 2021 cycle top too. Notably, the 2018 bear market correction saw Bitcoin retrace 83.11% from the ascending trendline, while the 2022 pullback had BTC dropping 77.57% from the cycle top. Per the chart, this has formed a rising support line that has marked where BTC’s price bottomed during previous bear markets. Now, Bitcoin has seemingly topped around the trendline once again and could retrace up to 76.88% toward the $30,000 mark in 2026, if history repeats. BTC Retests Macro Triangle Bottom Analyst Rekt Capital also shared his perspective on BTC’s recent pullback now that it has broken down from its weekly price range and is revisiting the $82,500 bottom of its Macro Triangle formation. The analyst explained that Bitcoin has been forming a triangle pattern in the monthly timeframe since mid-2024, similar to its 2021 triangle formation that preceded the previous bear market. Per the analysis, the flagship crypto has shown a nearly identical price action to its 2021-2022 performance, with the price respecting the macro support and descending resistance. A breakdown from the macro triangle bottom “would confirm Bearish Acceleration,” he noted, adding that for bull market continuation, the cryptocurrency would need to break and hold above the macro descending resistance on longer timeframes. “Until then, we have more evidence that maybe we will be following 2021 [performance]. (…) It’s just a little bit more compressed.” He also pointed out that BTC is displaying a similar Bull Market EMAs crossover that occurred during the early stages of the previous bear market. Related Reading: Analysts Say Dogecoin Consolidation Is About To End – Parabolic Run Or Crash Ahead? Rekt Capital highlighted that the imminent crossover does not necessarily predict additional downside, but “is effectively confirming weakness, kind of responding to the weakness that we are already seeing and have seen for a while.” “History is suggesting to us that if we continue to make these macro lower highs, which are a result of weakening demand at historical support regions, then there’s more reason to be bearish rather than bullish,” he concluded.

    "title": "Hyperliquid (HYPE) Rally: Expert Suggests Continued Growth, $35 Target Looms",
    "body": "Hyperliquid (HYPE) has emerged as one of the few large‑cap cryptocurrencies showing sustained strength across multiple time frames, even as the broader digital asset market remains under pressure. While Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and most major tokens have struggled amid a market‑wide pullback, Hyperliquid has continued to post notable gains, setting it apart during what many consider the early stages of a bear market. What’s Driving Hyperliquid Higher Market data from CoinGecko shows that HYPE surged roughly 31% over the past week, pushing the token toward the $34 level earlier in the week, and marking its highest price in more than a month. Over the past 14 days, HYPE is up around 17%, while gains of 13% and 8% were recorded over the 30‑day and year‑over‑year periods, respectively. By comparison, Bitcoin has fallen 12% over two weeks, slipped 4% over the past month, and is down roughly 21% year‑over‑year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Begins To Rise, Raising Early Bear Market Concerns Experts have pointed to fundamental and structural developments as key drivers behind HYPE’s performance. Crypto analyst Elite Crypto highlighted the impact of Hyperliquid’s HIP‑3 upgrade, which introduced permissionless perpetual contracts tied to real‑world assets (RWAs) such as gold, silver, and other commodities. According to the analyst, trading activity in these products has expanded rapidly, with silver‑based perpetuals alone exceeding $1 billion in daily volume on many occasions. Elite Crypto also pointed to signs of institutional accumulation, noting that decentralized autonomous traders, including strategies operating directly on Hyperliquid, have been steadily increasing their exposure. In addition, research firm Citrini has published bullish commentary on the platform, and speculation around a potential HYPE exchange‑traded fund (ETF) has added to market interest. HYPE Faces Crucial Technical Test From a technical perspective, analysts see important levels coming into focus. DeFi Guru noted that HYPE is currently testing its primary descending resistance, describing recent price action as impulsive and confidence‑driven, suggesting a shift in momentum. The analyst identified $30 as a key level to reclaim decisively. A clean move above that area could open the door to the next major target near $35, which aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slides Toward $85,000 Despite Progress On US Crypto Market Structure Bill Another analyst, Efloud, offered a more cautious view and outlined potential support and resistance zones for Hyperliquid. He identified a key support region near the $23.7 level, which is crucial in determining whether the cryptocurrency will continue its rally. Efloud noted that price has already reached an intermediate resistance area and suggested that short‑side setups would only be considered if bearish market structure appears on lower time frames, either at current levels or closer to the $38–$39 range. Despite the broader bullish narrative, Hyperliquid has not been immune to short‑term volatility. Over the past 24 hours, HYPE has pulled back by roughly 10%, falling toward around $29. Analyst Ox Kaize described the recent dip as a normal market reaction, particularly given recent developments affecting both gold and Bitcoin. He asserts that a recovery in those markets could provide additional upside momentum for Hyperliquid, potentially pushing the token toward the $50 level. Additional catalysts remain on the horizon. A second Hyperliquid airdrop is expected in the near future, and Kaize believes the timing could be deliberate, as distributing tokens while prices remain below peak levels may support longer‑term ecosystem growth.

    "title": "Trump Nominates Pro-Crypto Kevin Warsh For New Fed Chair — Details",
    "body": "United States President Donald Trump has unveiled former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as his pick for the next chair of the US central bank. This move confirms the circulating rumors after the former Fed governor reportedly met with Trump at the White House on Thursday, January 29. Trump Pushes Warsh To Senate For Fed Chair Position On Friday, January 30, Trump, via his social media platform Truth Social, announced his nomination of ex-Fed official Kevin Warsh as the successor of Jerome Powell as the Federal Reserve chairman. Prior to this announcement, prediction platforms had heavily tipped Warsh as Trump’s likely pick. Related Reading: Why Litecoin Price Going To $2,000 Is Not A Fantasy, But Market Cap Math Warsh previously served on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011 and held senior roles at the White House National Economic Council during former President George Bush’s administration. The former Morgan Stanley banker was considered for the Fed chair job in 2017 before Powell was eventually appointed. Trump said in his announcement: I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best. On top of everything else, he is “central casting,” and he will never let you down. Congratulations Kevin! Warsh has been a vocal critic of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy long before Powell became chair. Unsurprisingly, his recent stance appears to align with Trump’s agenda of lowering interest rates. In fact, the former Wall Street executive said in an interview last July that President Trump was right to push the Fed to cut rates. Trump’s nomination of Warsh as the Fed chair still needs to be confirmed by the US Senate, with many commentators expecting a battle between the executive and legislative arms. While Trump seeks a Fed chair that listens to the White House, a homage that Powell has refused to pay, the Senate believes the Federal Reserve should function independently. What Does Warsh’s Selection Mean For Crypto? Warsh and Powell seem to be on opposite sides of the divide when it comes to the cryptocurrency industry and Bitcoin. While the current Federal Reserve chair has consistently played down BTC’s relevance in the greater US economy, Warsh has been fairly positive about the world’s largest cryptocurrency. In a recent conversation hosted by the Hoover Institution, Warsh said that Bitcoin is an important asset that doesn’t trouble him, and he doesn’t view the coin as a substitute for the dollar. “Bitcoin can help inform policymakers when they are doing things right or wrong,’ the former Morgan Stanley banker said.

    "title": "Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio Spikes To New High — Fresh Volatility Ahead?",
    "body": "After surging toward the $100,000 mark a few days into the new year, the price of Bitcoin looks set to end January in stark contrast to how it started the month. On Thursday, January 29, the flagship cryptocurrency fell to a multi-month low of around $81,500, with the general market sentiment worsening over the past few weeks. Going into the weekend, the price of Bitcoin has somewhat cooled off, recovering above the $93,000 level on Friday, January 30. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data suggests that the market leader is only on the verge of another violent price movement. BTC Setting Up For A Violent Liquidation Cascade In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, CryptoOnchain shared insights into the current on-chain condition of the Bitcoin price. According to the market quant, the Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) witnessed a notable upswing on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, while price was undergoing its most recent correction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Needs Deeper Liquidity Before A Real Recovery Takes Shape: Analysts For context, the Estimated Leverage Ratio is an on-chain metric that tracks the ratio between open interest and the reserve of an exchange (Binance, in this case). This metric measures the average amount of leverage used by the traders in a particular market or exchange. A higher ELR signals a higher market risk, suggesting that small price movements could lead to significant liquidations. According to data from CryptoQuant, CryptoOnchain highlighted that the Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio recently spiked to a critical level of 0.188 when the price fell to around $81,500, indicating that the Open Interest is exceptionally high relative to the exchange’s reserves. Furthermore, CryptoOnchain shared that the divergence between rising leverage and falling prices is a classic “bearish divergence” signal in the derivative market. “It indicates that despite the price weakness, traders are aggressively increasing their leverage positions,” the on-chain expert added. What’s more, CryptoOnchain revealed that when the market becomes heavily over-leveraged during a price correction, it implies that the traders are either “buying the dip” with high leverage or increasingly taking short positions. The market quant said this setup usually precedes a “violent liquidation cascade.” Overall, CryptoOnchain concluded that the market is currently in a high-tension zone, with the combination of peak leverage and low prices suggesting that a “squeeze” is imminent. The analyst, however, clarified that the direction of the next violent movement depends on the dominant side (bulls or bears) of the market. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $84,200, reflecting a nearly 1% jump in the past 24 hours.

    "title": "Tether Breaks Records: $10B Profit And $186B USDT Now In Circulation",
    "body": "Tether closed out the year with numbers that turned a few heads in finance circles. Reports say the firm posted net profits above $10 billion for 2025 while the stablecoin USDT grew to roughly $186 billion in circulation — a new high for the token and a sign of how central it has become to crypto markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Suppression? Analyst Claims Single Force Keeping Price Under $90K Strong Balance Sheet And Big Reserves Reports note that Tether’s balance sheet shows solid backing after dividends and payouts. The issuer reportedly ended the year with several billion in excess reserves and total assets that comfortably outmatched liabilities. That cushion has calmed investors who worry about backing for so much stablecoin. Tether’s cash and short-term holdings are heavy on US Treasury exposure. Based on reports, a large slice of its reserves sits in Treasuries and similar instruments that generate steady interest income. That income helped drive the large profit number, even as the company moved into other assets. The numbers came from Tether’s most recent annual attestation, prepared by independent accountants at BDO, highlighting the company’s status as one of the top earners in the digital asset sector. Gold Buys And A Shift In Mix Reports say Tether has been increasing its holdings of physical gold alongside Treasuries. Recent filings and public comments show roughly 27 tons of gold purchased in the final quarter of the year, and the firm has said it may aim for between 10% and 15% of its portfolio in gold over time. That move is meant to diversify reserves and trim exposure to any single market. Stock And Market Effects The profit and the increase in the USDT supply have spillover effects. Market makers and exchanges usually use Tether as the primary dollar substitute in the crypto market, and the increased USDT supply improves trading and payment liquidity. On the other hand, some rating agencies and analyst firms have pointed out some concerns. There are potential issues with transparency and risk if markets turn against them due to increased allocations to non-Treasury assets. What This Means For Users And Regulators For users, the first thing to note is that the increased supply of USDT in the market typically means improved on-ramps for trading and moving value between platforms. For regulators and big lenders, the numbers underline why stablecoins attract scrutiny. Reports note that watchdogs want clearer, repeatable disclosures to match the scale of these holdings. Related Reading: Ethereum Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech Tether’s recent performance frames a larger story about how crypto handles dollar-like liquidity in practice. The company says its reserves and reporting meet its own standards, while independent commentators push for still greater clarity. Either way, USDT’s role has grown, and the conversation about risk, disclosure, and where those backing assets sit is only getting louder. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Adjusted SOPR Shows Market At Pivotal Junction — What’s Next?",
    "body": "Over the past week, the Bitcoin market experienced new waves of liquidations with prices dropping to around $81,000 on Thursday. Though the premier cryptocurrency has seen a slight rebound since then, bearish sentiments remain dominant with analysts expecting a potential decline to as low as $56,000. Amid this recent correction, a developing on-chain situation has reached a boiling point, putting the Bitcoin market at a critical juncture. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slide To $82K Sets Off A $1.7 Billion Chain Reaction Bitcoin aSOPR Holds Clue To Next Market Phase – Analyst The Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) is an on-chain metric used to measure whether Bitcoin investors are, on average, selling their coins at a profit or at a loss, while filtering out noise from short-term, low-value movements. In usual market trends, each new price peak is accompanied by higher conviction as investors are willing to hold longer, take profits later, and tolerate larger drawdowns because they expect even higher prices. However, during Bitcoin’s ascent from around $40,000 in early 2024 to over $100,000, the aSOPR has shown a different pattern as observed by market analyst MorenoDV. Despite a consistent uptrend resulting in multiple price peaks, Bitcoin aSOPR established a downtrend pattern marked by lower highs and lower lows, thereby creating a puzzling market divergence. According to MorenoDV, this development suggests that Bitcoin traders were aggressively taking profits with each rally, indicating a lack of long-term market confidence. Considering the descending profit-taking pattern, it can also be inferred that investors were satisfied with smaller and smaller gains, suggesting they were no longer convinced that upside continuation was likely. Related Reading: Bitmine Stakes Additional 250,912 Ethereum Worth $745M – 61% Is Now Staked The Present Market Debacle Despite the ongoing divergence, it is still observed that aSOPR respects the general market trend with each high in its descending channel aligning with a local price top, while each retest of the lower boundary coincides with a market bottom. Presently, the aSOPR is retesting this lower boundary, in a fear-ridden market with over 30% of market supply in a loss. Ideally, MorenoDV explains these are accumulation opportunities, especially in further consideration of the negative aSOPR. However, the analyst warns that a decisive fall below this line could strengthen present bearish sentiments, resulting in an intense market capitulation, as an already fearful set of investors would likely initiate a sell-off. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade around $83,819, reflecting 0.41% decline in the past day. Following the recent liquidations, the market leader is now 34% away from its all time high of around $126,100. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview",

    "title": "Crypto Funds Bleed $1.80 Billion As Metals Rally Heats Up",
    "body": "Investors stepped back this week as a mix of shifting bets and quick profit-taking pushed money out of spot crypto ETFs. Markets moved fast, and some of the biggest swings were driven by short-term reactions rather than a change in long-term views. Related Reading: Ethereum Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech Spot Crypto ETF Flows Based on reports from Farside, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs saw about $1.50 billion leave over five trading days, while spot Ether ETFs had roughly $327 million in outflows. That adds up to about $1.80 billion pulled from these funds in just a few days. On Jan. 14, reports note a very large inflow for Bitcoin ETFs — $840 million — which shows how quickly money can go in and out. Some traders treated that day as a buying moment. Others used it to take profit. That push-and-pull shows up in the numbers. A Rally In Metals, Then A Sudden Drop Gold and silver grabbed attention when they climbed to fresh highs. Prices surged, and many investors moved money into precious metals. But the rally was short-lived. On a single trading day, gold fell sharply from its peak and silver tumbled even more. Reports say those sudden reversals left some investors rethinking their moves and helped create a wave of selling across other risk assets, including crypto. Bitcoin Price Action Bitcoin has been swinging. Over the past week, BTC fell about 6.50% while Ether dropped around 8.90%, and they were trading around $82,500 and $2,685, respectively, according to CoinMarketCap. The market had a short spike after talk of the US CLARITY Act, but prices then cooled. Moves like this are often tied to positioning, margin calls, and traders reacting to headlines. At times, large flows into ETFs have pushed prices up. Other times, outflows coincide with volatile days when traders close positions quickly. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slide To $82K Sets Off A $1.7 Billion Chain Reaction What Analysts Are Saying Reports note that some market watchers view the pullback as temporary. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the current negativity about Bitcoin’s price is short-sighted and pointed to strong performance in prior years as context. Another voice, Bitwise’s Matt Hougan, suggested that continued ETF demand could send Bitcoin into a much higher trajectory over time. These views reflect different timeframes — some focus on immediate flows, others on how steady demand might shape prices months from now. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "Despite a major outflow just a day earlier, Spot XRP ETFs have defied bearish sentiment, setting record trading volumes and attracting fresh inflows. This resilience and surge in investor demand is particularly surprising given the recent crash in the XRP price and the overall downturn in the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Ethereum Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech XRP ETFs Defy Trends And Hit Record Volume XRP is making headlines after its ETF experienced fresh inflows following a significant outflow. According to data from SoSoValue, XRP ETFs saw a record $92.9 million drop on January 29, 2026. This marked the largest reduction since their launch on November 13, 2025. Since becoming available for trading, XRP ETFs have registered only three outflows, with the recent $92.9 million decrease being the third. This withdrawal was primarily driven by Grayscale’s GXRP, which saw a whopping $98.39 million leave the fund, partially offset by inflows into Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ, Bitwise’s XRP ETF, and Canary’s XRPC. At the time of the outflow, the total net assets of XRP ETFs fell to $1.21 billion from $1.39 billion the day earlier. The decline coincided with a drop in XRP’s price, which fell from $1.92 to $1.80 over 24 hours. Unexpectedly, XRP ETFs picked up just a day after the $92.9 million withdrawal. They recorded a daily total net inflow of $16.79 million, although total net assets still declined slightly to $1.19 billion. More impressively, Spot XRP ETFs achieved record trading volumes despite the overall downtrend. Data from The Block shows that XRP ETFs saw their cumulative volume rise to $2.23 billion from $2.15 billion just one day after the $92.9 million daily outflow. Reports indicated that Bitwise’s XRP ETF had the highest trading volume at the time, followed by Grayscale’s GXRP, Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ, Canary’s XRPC, and 21Shares TOXR, in that order. In terms of total Assets Under Management (AUM), XRP ETFs declined slightly, falling from $1.48 billion to $1.32 billion following the January 29 outflow. XRP Price Continues Slide Amid Market Uncertainty While XRP ETFs are recovering from recent outflows, the cryptocurrency’s price continues to decline, extending its losses from earlier this year. According to CoinMarketCap, XRP has dropped by more than 11% over the past week and a little over 3% in the last 24 hours. Following this decline, its price now sits around $1.69, representing a more than 15% fall from its $2 level seen just a few weeks ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slide To $82K Sets Off A $1.7 Billion Chain Reaction XRP’s daily trading volume is also down by more than 26.6% at the time of writing, indicating a potential decline in trader confidence and growing uncertainty in the market. Supporting this trend, XRP’s Fear and Greed Index has fallen into the “Fear” zone. The broader crypto market is showing similar weakness, with the index signaling extreme fear across major digital assets. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Slips Below This Key Zone — Is A Final Flush Coming?",
    "body": "Bitcoin has once again fallen below a critical support zone, raising questions about whether the market is gearing up for a deeper sell-off. With selling pressure still intact, traders are now watching key levels closely to see if a final flush toward lower support is imminent. Price Faces Another Rejection MakroVision Research shared on X that Bitcoin has once again met strong rejection, resulting in a decisive break below several key support levels. Price has now slipped back into the range of the previous low and continues to trade beneath the critical green resistance zone between $85,200 and $86,200, highlighting that bearish pressure remains in control for now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Begins To Rise, Raising Early Bear Market Concerns On the very short-term timeframe, there are early signs of an attempted rebound, but without a timely and sustainable reclaim of the $85,200–$86,200 zone, this move is best viewed as a technical counter-bounce rather than the start of a meaningful trend reversal. As long as the price remains capped below this area, the broader short-term downtrend remains intact. From a tactical perspective, the $85,200–$86,200 region has become the key battlefield. A clean reclaim and hold above this zone would be the first clear indication that selling pressure is beginning to fade, potentially allowing for price stabilization and a relief rally. If this reclaim attempt fails, the risk of continued downside acceleration increases. In that case, focus would turn to the $72,300–$75,300 range, a technically prominent support zone with historical significance. This zone may ultimately serve as a potential support and reversal region should the market experience another phase of capitulation. CME Gap Opens: What To Expect From Bitcoin This Weekend Crypto analyst MartyParty, in a recent Bitcoin Wyckoff Accumulation update, highlighted that a CME gap is opening, which is expected to be filled by Sunday evening. This sets the stage for potential short-term volatility, with traders closely watching key technical levels and liquidation activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Backs Off Resistance — Breakdown Or Brief Pause? Several scenarios are possible over the coming days. One possibility is the continued liquidation of remaining leveraged longs, with the lowest 25x Binance liquidation currently around $79,350, potentially completing the classic Wyckoff Spring pattern. Another scenario is a retest of secondary support at $81,800, which could act as a temporary floor for Bitcoin’s price action. If support at $81,800 holds, Bitcoin may trade sideways or attempt to push toward the primary support level, which has now turned into resistance at $84,800. The most probable scenario suggests a move up through $84,500 toward $86,463, followed by a retest of $84,500 on Sunday night as the CME gap is filled, completing the near-term Wyckoff accumulation setup.

    "title": "Why Shiba Inu Holders Should Look Forward To Sunday",
    "body": "Shiba Inu has spent recent weeks locked in a downward price action with bullish momentum fading and investor interest thinning without a clear bullish direction. However, holders may finally have something concrete to anticipate. Refreshing activity from Shytoshi Kusama, the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s lead developer, has diverted attention to a key moment expected on Sunday. Lead Dev Breaks Silence, Teases Sunday That dynamic began to change when Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous lead developer and co-founder of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, resurfaced on X after a prolonged absence since early December. However, Kusama broke his silence this week with a thread on X explaining the reasons behind his inactivity and has since returned to regular posting and reposting activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slide To $82K Sets Off A $1.7 Billion Chain Reaction One post stood out more than the rest, in which Kusama hinted at a revelation scheduled for Sunday. In that message, he spoke about arriving at a discovery by pure chance and referenced what he described as an ancient marker older than time itself. Although the message was a bit cryptic, it immediately generated attention across the SHIB community, which has been hungry for direction and clarity amid recent challenges in Shiba Inu’s price action. The significance of Sunday became clearer following an interesting exchange between Kusama and a Shiba Inu community member who openly expressed concerns about transparency, reassurance, and leadership presence after recent ecosystem issues. The community member, known as RuggRat on X, noted how there has been no official statement or simple explanation of what happened from Kusama regarding the Shibarium exploit. This is in reference to the September 2025 Shibarim Bridge exploit, which saw attackers making off with $4.1 million worth of crypto assets. In response, Kusama acknowledged the concern, stating that silence can sometimes be strategic and framing Sunday as a moment for addressing issues step by step. “This is what Sunday is for. One at a time,” Kusama said. Fair. But sometimes silence is a weapon for quiet wars. This is what Sunday is for. One bandage. Take off. Fix. Put on. One at a time. — Shytoshi Kusama™ (@ShytoshiKusama) January 29, 2026 Shiba Inu’s Challenging Phase Has Tested Holder Confidence Shiba Inu’s price action has struggled to gain any meaningful upside traction since the beginning of 2026, an extension of its late 2025 run. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading around $0.0000071, keeping it pinned down by 1.8% and 10.5% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. Price structure during this period has been marked by a series of lower lows, with persistent selling pressure leaving little room for a meaningful higher high to form. Related Reading: Ethereum Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech This prolonged stagnation has been difficult for many Shiba Inu holders, and many of them are increasingly becoming sellers. Furthermore, expectations around ecosystem expansion and utility has yet to reflect positively in the price. That environment is exactly why leadership communication has mattered more than usual.
