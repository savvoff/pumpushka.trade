    "title": "Bitcoin Risks Drop To $69,000 If Pennant Support Breaks, Analyst Warns",
    "body": "A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how Bitcoin could risk a crash to $69,230 if the support level of this Bear Pennant doesn’t hold up. Bitcoin Might Need To Hold Above $87,200 In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a support level that BTC might have to hold in order to avoid a steep drop. The level in question is the lower line of a Bear Pennant. A Pennant is a pattern from technical analysis (TA) that’s similar to a Flag. Both of these patterns are characterized by an initial sharp move (commonly known as the “pole”) and a subsequent phase of consolidation. But unlike Flags, which involve a parallel consolidation channel, Pennants involve a triangular channel instead. Related Reading: $460M Crypto Longs Squeezed As Bitcoin Slips Below $90,000 When the price is trading inside the consolidation portion of the Pennant, it encounters resistance at the upper line and support at the lower one. A breakout of either of these levels may signal a sustained move in that direction. Pennants are generally considered to be continuation patterns, so a move may be more likely to take place in the same direction as the pole. In a Bear Pennant, the pole is represented by a downward move, implying that a bearish continuation could succeed the pattern. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Bear Pennant that Bitcoin has been trading inside on the daily timeframe over the last couple of months: As displayed in the above graph, Bitcoin retested the upper line of the Pennant’s consolidation region when its price surged above $94,000. This retest ended up in rejection, and the coin has since retraced to lower levels. If the current trajectory in the cryptocurrency continues, it’s possible that a retest of the support level could take place, which is situated around $87,200. Since the pattern involved here is a Bear Pennant, BTC failing a retest of this line could signal a bearish breakout. Pennant breakouts are usually considered to lead to a move that’s similar to the pole in length. Based on this, BTC’s breakout target from the current pattern could lie near $69,000. “Bitcoin $BTC must hold above $87,200 to avoid a drop toward $69,230,” explained the analyst. Bitcoin is currently also trading near an important on-chain level: the Active Realized Price. This indicator keeps track of the average cost basis of the active network participants. According to data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the Active Realized Price is located at $87,700 right now, meaning that the active investors are in a slight amount of net profit.

    "body": "The notorious crypto crash on October 10 of last year sent shockwaves through the market, resulting in the largest liquidation event in history with nearly $20 billion in losses. This catastrophic event ignited significant criticisms and fears among investors regarding the stability of the cryptocurrency market. However, the upcoming crypto market structure bill, known as the CLARITY Act, is being touted as a potential safeguard against future crashes. Market Manipulation In Crypto Could Plummet Market expert Crypto Rover recently took to social media to express optimism about the CLARITY Act as the Senate prepares for a markup on January 15. According to Rover, this crypto bill could reduce market manipulation in the crypto space by an impressive 70% to 80%. Related Reading: 3 Vital Factors Needed For A Lasting 2026 Crypto Surge, Bitwise CIO Unveils He noted the devastating effects of the October 10 event, describing it as a “massacre” for crypto holders, many of whom lost their life savings without clear answers about who was ultimately responsible for the chaos. Rover is confident that with the implementation of the CLARITY Act, the cryptocurrency market could begin operating more like traditional financial markets (TradFi). Institutional Investment Set To Surge Once the CLARITY Act passes in the Senate, Rover asserts that it will move to the floor for a full vote before returning to the House for final approval and eventually reaching President Trump’s desk. He further suggested that this entire process could take one to two months, potentially allowing the CLARITY Act to be signed into law by March 2026.

    "body": "On-chain data show a significant amount of Shiba Inu still held on exchanges, putting the SHIB price at risk of a decline due to sell-offs. This comes amid a positive increase in net flows, indicating that more coins are flowing into exchanges, likely to offload them. SHIB Price At Risk With 82 Trillion Shiba Inu On Exchanges CryptoQuant data shows that the Shiba Inu exchange reserve is at 82 trillion coins. This indicates higher selling pressure, especially as the value has risen from around 81 trillion at the start of the year. Amid this development, the SHIB price has trimmed some of its year-to-date gains, with the meme coin dropping from a high above $0.000009 just as the exchange reserve rose. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Shiba Inu Price Jumped Over 13% Another bearish indicator for Shiba Inu at the moment is the exchange netflow. Further data from CryptoQuant show that the exchange netflow has turned positive, indicating that more coins are being deposited into exchanges than removed. As such, the meme coin is likely currently facing more selling pressure than buying pressure, putting the SHIB price at risk of a decline. Notably, the Shiba Inu exchange netflow turned positive just as the SHIB price reached its yearly high above $$0.000009. The recent bearish sentiment in the broader crypto market has likely contributed to these sell-offs for SHIB, with the Bitcoin price dropping back to $90,000 after rising above $94,000 at the start of the year. Activity in the Shiba Inu derivatives market also paints a bearish picture for the SHIB price. CoinGlass data shows that trading volume has dropped by just over 5%, to $203 million. SHIB’s open interest is also down over 7%, dropping to $108 million. However, a positive is that most traders are still bullish on the meme coin, with the long/short ratio above 1. An Increase In SHIB Whale Transactions A positive for the SHIB price is that whales still appear to be bullish on the meme coin. On-chain analytics platform Santiment recently pointed out a 111% spike in Shiba Inu’s whale transactions. Thanks to this development, SHIB ranks among the tokens with a market cap of at least $500 that have seen an increase in whale transactions above $100,000. Related Reading: Shiba Inu End Of Year Predictions Remain Bearish, High Volatility Expected Meanwhile, CryptoQuant data show that the number of daily Shiba Inu active addresses has climbed since the start of the year and has remained above the 3,000 threshold. This is a positive as it indicates that attention is now returning to the SHIB ecosystem, which could positively impact the SHIB price once the crypto market rebounds again. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.000008752, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "Ripple Builds ‘Next Amazon’ With XRP At The Center, Says Crypto CEO",
    "body": "Ripple’s 2025 acquisition spree is starting to look, in the eyes of Digital Ascension Group CEO Jake Claver, less like opportunistic dealmaking and more like an attempt to build the “Amazon of financial infrastructure,” a vertically integrated stack where XRP and Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD sit at the settlement layer. In a video, Claver said Ripple spent roughly $2.45 billion on acquisitions in the last seven months of 2025, arguing the purchases form “pillars for a master plan” that mirrors how Amazon built dominance by owning infrastructure rather than just selling products. Why Ripple Could Be The ‘Next Amazon’ The core analogy was explicit. “Amazon’s success came from building infrastructure, not just from self products,” Claver said. “You got AWS. It became the most profitable piece of their business. That was infrastructure. They own all of the warehouses and logistics and the cloud and the marketplace.” Related Reading: How XRP Ledger Becomes The Leading Blockchain In 2026: Fintech CEO His contention is that infrastructure plays create structural advantages: lower marginal costs, faster iteration, and higher switching costs once institutions integrate. “This vertical integration is rare in financial services,” he said, arguing that most firms “specialize in one layer or partner for the rest,” which introduces friction, delays, and blame-shifting when systems fail. He also claimed the endgame resembles “winner take all dynamics,” where “network effects make the large networks exponentially more valuable than small ones” and “switching becomes cost prohibitive” once workflows are embedded. To explain the Amazon comparison, Claver mapped Ripple’s 2025 deals to what he sees as the minimum viable infrastructure bundle for an institutional “platform.” “You need custody and clearing for assets. You need treasury management for corporate operations. You need payment rails that work globally 24/7, 365,” he said. “You need a stable coin infrastructure for efficient settlements. And you need settlement assets to be able to move between all of those.” He argued Ripple has assembled those layers through a mix of older buys and 2025 mega-deals, culminating in what he called an end-to-end institutional product branded “Ripple 1.” The most prominent 2025 move, Claver said, was the $1.25 billion purchase of Hidden Road in April, now rebranded “Ripple Prime.” His framing: prime brokerage is the institutional “plumbing” that makes large-scale trading and settlement possible. “Prime brokers provide the behind-the-scenes services that make institutional trading possible,” he said. “They handle clearing. They make sure trade actually settles between counterparties. They provide custody and hold assets securely.” He added that Hidden Road served “over 300 institutional clients” and cleared “more than $3 trillion” in 2024, and claimed the business has grown “3x” since the acquisition announcement. Related Reading: XRP Retrace Is Only Temporary, What Happens Once the Uptrend Resumes He also pointed to an integration hook meant to create internal demand for Ripple’s stablecoin: “Hidden Road will use RLUSD as collateral across prime brokerage products. And this creates organic demand for Ripple stablecoin with institutional adoption.” The second pillar, he said, was Rail, acquired for about $200 million in August 2025, described as a stablecoin payments platform that operates 24/7 and reduces the need for enterprises to hold crypto directly. He claimed Rail was forecast to process “over 10%” of a $36 billion global B2B stablecoin payments market in 2025. Third came GTreasury, acquired for $1 billion after being announced in October 2025 and closing in December, which Claver described as treasury software used by large corporations and processing $12.5 trillion in annual payment volume. The strategic value, he argued, is distribution: access to CFOs and treasurers via trusted software already embedded in corporate finance workflows. The fourth, Palisade, announced in November 2025 with undisclosed terms, was framed as the “hot wallet” layer: operational wallet-as-a-service infrastructure for high-velocity transaction use cases, complementing deeper custody solutions.

    "title": "Ethereum’s Long Accumulation Nears Completion While ETH/BTC Holds The Line",
    "body": "Ethereum continues to trade within a prolonged accumulation phase, signaling that the market may be approaching a pivotal transition. As ETH/BTC firmly defends long-term cycle support, the structure points to quiet strength building beneath the surface, often a precursor to rotation and a decisive next move. Ethereum’s Inverted Monthly Chart Signals Late-Stage Accumulation EGRAG CRYPTO made a post, showing that Ethereum’s inverted monthly chart continues to reflect a familiar cyclical pattern, though with notable evolution. Each market cycle follows a similar rhythm, but as the asset matures, volatility compresses, and price behavior becomes more controlled. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Q1 Outlook: Analyst Shares Historical Setup As Price Nears Key Resistance In the first cycle, Ethereum experienced a brief accumulation phase followed by a sharp and violent drop. The second cycle extended the accumulation period, resulting in a more gradual decline. Meanwhile, in the third and current cycle, accumulation has lasted significantly longer, suggesting that any corrective phase should be comparatively shallow. It is important to note that the chart is inverted, meaning what appears as a drop on this view actually represents a breakout on the standard price chart. In this context, the current structure suggests that accumulation is nearing completion, and the market may be approaching its next decisive move. This setup points to a less explosive move compared to earlier cycles, but more controlled. From a price roadmap perspective, initial resistance is projected between $3,800 and $4,500. A successful flip of that zone into support could open the door toward the $6,000 to $7,500 region. The primary risk scenario remains a deeper retest toward the $1,800 to $2,200 range before a broader upside continuation. Why ETH/BTC Is A Key Market Barometer Right Now In a recent post on ETH/BTC, CyrilXBT emphasized that this remains one of the most important charts to monitor. Ethereum continues to defend the 2018 cycle support, consistently printing higher lows while price action tightens just below key resistance levels. This kind of compression often signals that the market is preparing for a larger move rather than breaking down. Related Reading: Here’s The Ethereum Descending Triangle Structure That Threatens A Crash Below $2,800 Importantly, there is no sign of panic or structural damage. Sellers have failed to force a decisive breakdown, while buyers continue to step in at higher levels, reinforcing the strength of the underlying support. The longer this base holds, the more meaningful the eventual breakout or rotation becomes. At this stage of the cycle, Ethereum does not need to outperform aggressively. Simply holding its relative value is usually enough to signal the early stages of capital rotation. Historically, sustained stability on the ETH/BTC pair tends to precede periods where Ethereum begins to take the lead once momentum fully returns.

    "body": "Cardano rallied this month after a clear rebound from a low zone around $0.33–$0.35. Prices jumped more than 10% on January 2, and ADA is up 20% year-to-date. Related Reading: Crypto Market Watches As Clarity Act Enters Senate Debate Next Week: US Senator Reports have disclosed that whale activity spiked on that day across both spot and futures markets, according to recent data. Governance on January 8 approved a 70 million ADA treasury allocation aimed at supporting USDC/USDT integrations, oracle work with Pyth Network, and cross-chain tools. Market players say that is hard cash being put to work. Hoskinson Sees Bitcoin As A Trigger According to Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, a fresh Bitcoin push to a record high would help lift other tokens, including ADA. He has forecast that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 toward the end of this year, a move that would push its market cap to roughly $5 trillion. Hoskinson argued that when Bitcoin leads a rally, investors tend to buy BTC first because it offers liquidity and a sense of relative safety, and then capital flows into higher-risk assets later. UPDATE: #Cardano $ADA Founder Charles Hoskinson says “I believe Bitcoin will reach an all-time high, and I also believe there’s going to be some value leakage from Bitcoin into the altcoin space.” $NIGHT pic.twitter.com/yFAzinx4cs — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) January 7, 2026 Past Runs Show Rotation Into Altcoins Based on reports and past market moves, Bitcoin’s big rallies have often preceded strong gains in alternative tokens. In 2021, Bitcoin climbed to about $68,000 and several major altcoins surged afterwards. Ethereum hit roughly $4,950 in August 2025, while XRP peaked near $3.66 in July of that year. Back then, ADA topped above $3 at its peak. Those episodes are often cited as examples where profit-seeking behavior shifted from the largest coin into smaller projects. Bitcoin’s Recent Highs Did Not Help All Tokens Market watchers point out that history is not a guarantee. In October 2025, Bitcoin reached a new record of $126,198, but only a few assets rode that wave. Many altcoins stayed flat or posted modest gains. That pattern is being used by some analysts to temper expectations about how much value will “leak” from BTC into altcoins this cycle. The size of any rotation, Hoskinson himself warned, is still uncertain and could differ from earlier cycles. Liquidity and macro conditions will matter. ETF flows, trader positioning, and whether developers and users adopt new features are among the things investors will watch. A Measured Outlook Reports note that Cardano’s recent treasury spend targets stablecoins and oracle access, which could help DeFi activity on the network if projects take up the funding. Competition from other layer ones and scaling solutions is real, and capital can move quickly between chains. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Bring The Heat: $1.2 Billion Flows In First 48 Hours—Analyst The view from Hoskinson is bullish on the linkage between Bitcoin highs and altcoin upside, but the evidence from late 2025 shows that link can be uneven. ADA’s recent moves — a bounce from $0.33–$0.35, a more than 10% single-day gain on January 2, and a 70 million ADA treasury allocation on January 8 — give the token practical catalysts beyond market talk. Whether those actions translate into sustained price gains will depend on broader market flows and how the allocated funds are used. Featured image from Gemini, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Price Hits Crash Line, But This Time Is Not Random",
    "body": "According to a new technical analysis, the Bitcoin price has returned to its “Crash Line,” fueling talk of a possible bullish turnaround. The expert behind this analysis has suggested that this is not a random event, but a deliberate move that could signal the beginning of Bitcoin’s next upward move. Bitcoin Price Revisits Familiar Crash Line In a recent post on X, market analyst Crypto Tice announced that Bitcoin has just hit the Crash Line, a level that has repeatedly acted as a critical reload point during the current bull cycle. The analyst indicated that this trendline has historically led to strong price rallies for BTC. He observed that throughout the bull market, Bitcoin has consistently followed the same sequence each time the price returns to the Crash Line. Related Reading: Crypto Market Watches As Clarity Act Enters Senate Debate Next Week: US Senator The process begins with momentum overheating, meaning buyers push prices up too quickly, creating unsustainable upward pressure. As this momentum builds, excessive leverage accumulates in the market, followed by a sharp correction. This price decline often brings Bitcoin back to the Crash Line. From this point, BTC usually starts gearing up for its next expansion phase. Crypto Tice shared a weekly chart illustrating this pattern. Each time Bitcoin approached the Crash Line, its price corrected by about 33.10% and 30.97% before quickly surging higher. Now that Bitcoin has returned to the Crash Line after a recent 33.38% drop, the analyst suggested it could follow the same historical trend and launch a major rally. Crypto Tice also noted that the Crash Line has consistently marked leverage flushes, selling-pressure exhaustion, and trend continuation zones for Bitcoin. Rather than signaling structural weakness, the analyst said this trendline has acted as a transition point. He noted that if the broader structure remains intact, the Crash Line could mark the area where Bitcoin’s upside reloads. Analyst Predicts Next Possible Moves For Bitcoin In a separate X post, market expert Crypto King said that Bitcoin is currently “stuck in a no trading zone,” meaning that the market still lacks a clear direction despite its recent rebound above $90,000. The analyst added that BTC’s liquidity and market participation are drying up, particularly as price moves sideways and the risk of getting caught in false moves increases. As a result, Crypto King has outlined two possible scenarios for Bitcoin. If the cryptocurrency can push above $92,000 and hold that level, he expects it to flip from resistance into support. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator On the other hand, if price fails to reclaim $92,000, the analyst predicts Bitcoin could decline again, this time testing the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap at $88,000. The analyst has highlighted two potential demand zones on the chart: one around the CME gap and another extending lower between $60,000 and $50,000.

    "body": "After a fairly optimistic start to the new year, the Bitcoin price might finally be ready to take off, as revealed by a market analyst. The pundit believes that the flagship cryptocurrency can reclaim its six-figure valuation over the next few weeks, particularly as a key technical indicator has turned bullish. Why BTC Price Could Be Headed For $105,000 In Three Weeks In a January 9 post on the social media platform X, pseudonymous crypto pundit Bitbull shared a positive outlook for the Bitcoin price in the coming weeks. According to the crypto analyst, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could return to around $103,000 and $105,000 in the next three to four weeks. Related Reading: Cathie Wood: Trump May Buy Bitcoin For US Reserve Ahead Of Midterms This optimistic prediction is based on changes in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the Bitcoin weekly chart. The relative strength index is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis to assess the magnitude and speed of an asset’s price changes. The RSI oscillator typically analyzes whether a crypto asset (Bitcoin, in this case) is being overbought or oversold, suggesting a possible price or trend reversal. When the relative strength index rises above 70, it usually suggests an overbought market condition, with the asset’s price likely to witness a bearish reversal. On the other hand, an RSI value below the 30 mark means that the market is oversold, with the price potentially reaching a bottom. BitBull revealed that the Bitcoin weekly RSI has been in an extended decline in the past three months and has only just broken above the downward trend line. According to the market pundit, the technical indicator is signaling further upside for the Bitcoin price. As observed in the chart above, the price of Bitcoin went on a significant rally the last time the weekly RSI broke out of a downward trend. This breakout last occurred in April 2025, preceding BTC’s rally to its current all-time high of $126,080, representing an almost 50% surge. This time around, BitBull expects the Bitcoin price to rise to between $103,000 and $105,000 in the course of the next three to four weeks. Hitting this target would represent an approximately 15% rally from the current price point. Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, the price of BTC sits around $90,600, reflecting an almost 1% decline in the past 24 hours. While the premier cryptocurrency made a strong start to the year, the market has since cooled down. The Bitcoin price has been mostly hovering around the $90,000 mark, with only a few runs above $91,000 in the past week. According to data from TradingView, the BTC price is up by 3% so far in 2026.
