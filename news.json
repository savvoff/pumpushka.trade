    "title": "Bitcoin Emerges As A Hedge Amid Rising Global Geopolitical Tensions",
    "body": "As global geopolitical tensions intensify from trade fragmentation and sanctions to regional conflicts and currency weaponization, Bitcoin is increasingly emerging as a hedge outside the reach of politics. In an environment where traditional financial systems are shaped by state power and cross-border capital controls, BTC’s decentralized design is drawing renewed attention as a form of monetary insurance in an increasingly unstable world. Bitcoin’s Performance During Periods Of Instability The geopolitical tension may boost Bitcoin. Walter Bloomberg has noted on X that BTC’s recent rebound suggests rising geopolitical tensions are increasingly pushing investors toward cryptocurrencies. Walter made reference to 21Shares strategist Matt Mena’s statement, who stated that BTC is gaining recognition as a neutral reserve asset, alongside traditional safe havens such as gold and silver. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply Is Being Absorbed By Powerful Financial Players — What This Means After falling more than 6% last year, BTC has historically avoided back-to-back annual declines, supporting the case for gains this year. BTC was last down 0.3% at $93,740, after reaching a seven-week high of $94,725 on Monday, underscoring its resilience amid heightened global uncertainty. Considering most of the world is ecstatic with 8% annual returns, an analyst known as Juicy pointed out that the idea of doubling your money in one or two years is already an exceptional outcome for most average people. The hard truth is that most people will never hold their BTC long enough before they cash out 3 to 5 times their money, especially when BTC is down 50% in a bear market, because most people are emotionally attached to their money. Generational wealth with BTC is made by holding through multiple 50% bear market drawdowns across decades. The expert stated that his strategy is never to fully sell BTC, but to sell small portions at basic milestones like $250,000, $500,000, and $1 million, or even $10 million, while the main stack will not be sold. Extreme Supply And The Shift In Spot Momentum A trader known as DD highlighted that BTC traded directly into extreme supply just below Monday’s high and was aggressively rejected from there. This move was followed by a sharp push lower and was driven by heavy spot selling, confirming that this area remains a significant supply zone rather than a breakout point. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks A Year-Long Bear Market If This Happens: On-Chain Data DD recalled the weak weekly low, a level that has now been cleared. The market is now in a phase where the response matters more than a continuation. If the price begins to form local accumulation inside demand, that would present an opportunity to look for long exposure. On the other hand, if BTC bounces back into supply and shows clear signs of weakness, then the short setup will also remain valid. Structurally, losing the $91,000 level will open the door towards the weak monthly low around $87,800, which stands out as the next downside level.

    "title": "XRP Mirrors Gold’s Trajectory: What A Similar ATH Rally Would Mean",
    "body": "After enduring weeks of capitulation, sustained price declines, and overall market weakness last year, XRP is showing signs of a recovery. The cryptocurrency has rebounded above the $2.2 level after beginning the new year at a low of above $1.90. According to a crypto expert, XRP’s long-term outlook remains significantly bullish. He compares XRP’s projected trajectory to gold’s price movement, predicting a similar historic all-time high rally. XRP Tracks Gold’s Historic Run Market analyst ‘Steph is Crypto’ has stated that XRP is showing a rare chart setup that closely mirrors gold’s macro move between 2023 and 2025. In his analysis shared on X, the crypto expert explained that after a prolonged corrective phase, XRP has completed a clean Wave 4 structure, formed a Falling Wedge, and is now breaking out in a way that reflects early trend expansion behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Parabola: What’s Different Between The Last Bull Cycle And This One? The analyst shared a parallel chart that illustrated gold’s price action over the years on one side and XRP’s movement and future trajectory on the other. Over the two-day timeframe, XRP has completed an impulsive Wave 1-3, followed by a downward-sloping corrective channel that slopes into Wave 4, ending with a compression typical of a Falling Wedge. Steph is Crypto directly compares this formation and price movement to gold, which went through an almost identical structure earlier between 2022 and 2023. Following this corrective pattern, gold broke out decisively, entering a strong expansion phase that carried the price to new ATHs over the past months. The breakout also led to a sustained rally with minimal pullbacks and consolidation for almost two years. Based on gold’s explosive historic performance, Steph is Crypto has projected that XRP could replicate a similar trajectory in 2026. The XRP chart shows price stabilizing above the Falling Wedge breakout area near the mid-$2 range. From there, the projected path suggests a rapid expansion phase that mirrors gold’s post-breakout trajectory. If XRP replicates this historic run, it implies a new all-time high cycle, with the price potentially skyrocketing toward $37 before the end of 2026 or the beginning of 2027. The visual projection line on the chart shows that XRP could also experience a similar steady price expansion phase with minimal pullbacks along the way. Analyst Says XRP Could Outperform Bitcoin Soon Crypto analyst Matt Hughes has shared a new analysis of the XRP/BTC chart, pointing to a potential shift in long-term price performance. He believes that XRP is gearing up to outperform Bitcoin this year, based on a rate technical signal that just emerged on the trading pair’s chart. Related Reading: Popular Crypto Founder Dumps Millions In Ethereum, Here’s What He’s Buying According to Hughes, an incredibly bullish setup that has not appeared in years is developing on the XRP/BTC chart. He stated that price is about to break above the monthly Ichimoku Cloud for the first time since 2018, when XRP exploded to its current ATH of $3.84. Notably, a successful move above this cloud would signal a deep structural change in the cryptocurrency’s trend, potentially leading to significant relative gains this year.

    "title": "Strategist Reveals What Will Drive XRP Price To $100 Per Coin",
    "body": "XRP has opened the year on a firm footing, reversing the bearish momentum that carried it through the closing weeks of last year. Interestingly, one strategist is already pushing the conversation far beyond near-term targets. In a recent post on the social media platform X, BarriC outlined a psychological roadmap that explains how XRP could eventually trade at $100 per coin. This roadmap is built around how investor attitudes start to change as XRP reaches different price levels, which will gradually turn disbelief into C and urgency. Complacency At $2 To Quiet Regret Above $10 BarriC’s model starts with what he described as a dangerous sense of comfort at the lower end of XRP’s price range. Around $2 per XRP, most people assume they will always have access to cheap tokens, which removes any urgency to act. This attitude is evident in XRP’s current price action, with the cryptocurrency trading around $2.25 and slowly grinding higher. Related Reading: Here’s What Ripple Haters Get Wrong And Why XRP Is Set To Explode BarriC projected that even as the XRP price moves back toward $3, a successful reclaim of that level will still fail to generate excitement, because XRP is still seen as ordinary and easy to obtain. That same mindset, according to the strategist, will carry through to $5, where skepticism will start to take over. At that stage, critics begin questioning why XRP is only at $5 if it is truly expected to play a meaningful role in the future of global finance. However, BarriC believes the psychology will start to change once XRP pushes into double-digit territory, although not yet fully. Even if XRP is trading in the $10 to $20 range, most investors will not suddenly rush in but are still more likely to feel a subtle sense of regret mixed with resignation. This is where many convince themselves that XRP has likely reached its peak and that they have already missed the opportunity. BarriC describes this phase as one where people comfort themselves with the idea that at least it wasn’t a move to $100. Why $100 Becomes The Emotional Breaking Point According to BarriC, the fear of missing out is what will ultimately push the price of XRP into triple-digit territory. In his view, once XRP reaches $100, the disbelief will collapse and will be replaced by frustration and urgency, especially among investors who had long accepted the idea that such prices were impossible. Related Reading: XRP Price At $100 Is A liquidity Event Number, What This Means However, that will force latecomers to chase XRP at prices up to fifty times higher than its current price of $2. He extended this logic further by explaining that above $100, buying pressure would no longer be based on excitement alone. At $1,000 per XRP, the motivation will turn into desperation. His most extreme projection is a $10,000 XRP. This is a point of resignation, where investors fully grasp how severely they underestimated XRP’s long-term importance and the scale of the opportunity they once dismissed.

    "title": "SUI Isn’t Done Yet: Weekly Accumulation Holds As Buyers Reload Below",
    "body": "SUI continues to show resilience on the weekly chart, holding firm within a key accumulation zone even after a sharp correction from its highs. Buyers are once again stepping in at lower levels, suggesting reloading rather than distribution, as market structure hints that smart money may still be positioning for a broader upside move. Weekly Structure Holds After Deep 2024 Reset According to Crypto Patel, SUI continues to hold a high-timeframe accumulation zone on the weekly chart following a deep correction from its 2024 highs. The broader market structure points toward a re-accumulation phase, with signs that smart money participation is gradually returning after a sell-off. Related Reading: Analysts Turn Bullish on SUI as Token Extends Gains Amid Renewed Institutional Interest From a technical perspective, several key conditions are aligning. Liquidity has already been swept at the lows, while a strong weekly bullish order block between $1.50 and $1.30 remains intact. A Fair Value Gap (FVG) overlapping with this demand zone further strengthens the case for sustained buyer interest in SUI at these levels. Price action has already responded positively, delivering an approximately 45% bounce from the highlighted entry region. Furthermore, the rising channel structure remains unbroken, and the High-timeframe bias is now slowly tilting bullish as structure stabilizes. Crypto Patel maintains upside targets at $5, $10, and $20. As long as SUI/USDT stays above the $1.20 level, the macro bullish thesis remains valid, which acts as the key line separating continuation from failure. The setup is described as patience-driven, offering attractive risk-to-reward conditions for spot and swing traders willing to let the weekly structure play out. A weekly close below $1.20 would invalidate the bullish outlook, while continued defense of that level keeps the accumulation narrative firmly in play. SUI Remains Locked Within Its Established Structure In an earlier update, CryptoELlTES highlighted that SUI remains confined within the same broader market structure, with price continuing to respect its established range. This behavior suggests that the market has not yet committed to a new directional move, keeping both continuation and rejection scenarios in play. Related Reading: SUI Climbs Into High-Risk Territory As Wave 4 Nears Its Exhaustion Point The rising base has now been tested and defended multiple times, and once again, buyers stepped in aggressively from the lower trendline. Even so, the upper trendline remains intact, and that resistance is the real hurdle standing in the way of a confirmed bullish expansion. A decisive and clean break above that upper boundary would shift the overall tone, signaling stronger conviction and opening the door for sustained upside. However, if price fails at that level, the move risks being classified as just another relief bounce within the range, leaving the market stuck in consolidation and the larger direction still undecided.

    "title": "Solana Builds Strong Case for Higher Valuations as ETFs and Network Metrics Surge",
    "body": "Investors are expecting Solana (SOL) to gain momentum in 2026, driven by rising on-chain activity, expanding DeFi participation, and increasing institutional exposure through exchange-traded funds. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Bring The Heat: $1.2 Billion Flows In First 48 Hours—Analyst While SOL trades at $139, below its all-time high, recent data suggests that the network’s fundamentals are strengthening alongside a gradual price recovery. Together, these trends are shaping a clearer narrative around how Solana’s valuation could be supported beyond short-term market moves. SOL's price trends sideways on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Network Activity and DeFi Metrics Show Sustained Growth On-chain usage has picked up notably since the start of the year. Active addresses on Solana rose from around 3.38 million to 3.78 million in early January, indicating broader participation across transfers, trading, and application usage. This increase in activity has coincided with a steady rise in decentralized finance metrics. The TVL across Solana-based protocols increased from approximately $8 billion to just over $9 billion, reflecting higher capital commitments to lending, liquidity provision, and yield-focused strategies. These gains align with longer-term data from Solana’s 2025 network review, which showed that daily active wallets averaged 3.2 million and non-vote transactions reached a record 33 billion over the year. Decentralized exchange activity also remained a key contributor. The annual DEX volume reached $1.5 trillion in 2025, up 57% year-over-year, with SOL-stablecoin trading volume exceeding $780 billion. Raydium led DEX platforms in terms of volume, while several others surpassed the $10 billion threshold. Application Revenue and Ecosystem Expansion Revenue generation across the Solana ecosystem continues to scale. Applications built on the network generated $2.39 billion in revenue in 2025, a 46% increase from the prior year. Seven applications surpassed $100 million in annual revenue, while smaller projects collectively contributed more than $500 million. The network itself reported $1.4 billion in revenue, reflecting a sharp rise in economic activity tied to usage rather than speculation alone. Beyond DeFi, Solana also saw growth in stablecoin transfers, tokenized equities, and Bitcoin-related activity. Stablecoin supply more than doubled to $14.8 billion, while transfers reached $11.7 trillion, pointing to increased settlement and payment use cases. Solana ETF Inflows and Price Levels in Focus Institutional participation has become more visible through Solana-focused ETFs. Assets under management across these products recently crossed $1.02 billion, with Bitwise’s BSOL accounting for the majority share. Data shows cumulative inflows of nearly $800 million and steady trading volumes, suggesting ongoing demand for regulated exposure. In the spot market, SOL has rebounded from the $120 area to trade near $140, supported by rising volume and improving technical indicators.

    "title": "Did Morgan Stanley Orchestrate Bitcoin October Crash? Analysts Draw Correlations",
    "body": "Morgan Stanley’s filing for a Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF), coupled with MSCI’s decision to retain digital asset companies in its index, has ignited a wave of speculation among analysts. Notably, analysts from Bull Theory have alleged that these events could be indicative of a larger-scale market manipulation. Bitcoin Market Manipulation? In a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the Bull Theory analysts drew attention to the timeline of events involving Bitcoin, arguing that the trajectory from its October crash to its subsequent recovery in January resembles an orchestrated setup supported by data. The first significant trigger occurred on 10 October, when MSCI — previously a division of Morgan Stanley — proposed removing Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs) from its global indexes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Accumulation Continues: Strategy Purchases 1,287 BTC Amid Rising Prices This decision would affect firms like Strategy and Metaplanet, which hold substantial Bitcoin assets on their balance sheets. The implications were profound, given that MSCI’s indexes guide trillions of dollars in passive investments. If these companies were removed, institutional investors, including pension funds and ETFs, would be compelled to divest, leading to a substantial contraction in institutional exposure to Bitcoin and an immediate tightening of liquidity. Following that announcement, Bitcoin’s price plummeted by nearly $18,000, wiping out over $900 billion from the total crypto market cap. Morgan Stanley And The MSCI Shift The uncertainty continued with a consultation period that remained open until December 31. This three-month window of prolonged anxiety effectively froze investor demand for Bitcoin. Passive investors became wary, index-linked funds faced potential forced selling, and as a result, prices saw a stark decline—with Bitcoin dropping about 31% and altcoins suffering even more, marking the worst quarter for crypto markets since 2018. However, the tide began to shift on January 1, 2026, as Bitcoin experienced an unexpected surge, rising 8% in just five days. This $7,300 increase, from $87,500 to $94,800, left many analysts puzzled, especially since the relentless selling had seemingly halted abruptly. The analysts noted that this sudden upturn could imply that insiders might have had prior knowledge of forthcoming developments. Then, the narrative shifted dramatically on January 5 and 6. In a matter of 24 hours, Morgan Stanley unveiled its plans for spot Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and Solana ETFs. This was followed by MSCI announcing its decision not to proceed with the previously proposed exclusion of crypto-heavy companies from its indexes. A Calculated Move? The sequence of these events has led the analysts to present a narrative: MSCI initiated pressure by threatening index removals in October, leading to an extended period of uncertainty and suppressed prices. Related Reading: Solana Shatters Records: 2025 Annual Review Reveals New All-Time Highs In Key Metrics Once institutions had accumulated at lower prices, Morgan Stanley introduced its ETF, and MSCI subsequently removed the threat of exclusion, raising serious concerns about the possibility of coordinated efforts to manipulate market conditions. Bull Theory analysts assert that as the market now transitions back towards liquidity, the same entities that potentially orchestrated the prior downturn may be strategically positioned to profit from the rebound. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $91,550, having retraced 2% from the $95,000 2-month high reached at the beginning of the week. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Why Morgan Stanley’s Bitcoin ETF Is The ‘Most Bullish Thing Ever’: Jeff Park",
    "body": "Morgan Stanley’s decision to file for spot Bitcoin and Solana ETFs caught even seasoned ETF watchers off guard and in Jeff Park’s telling, it’s a stronger signal about crypto’s next leg of adoption than another round of flows into the existing market leaders. The surprise wasn’t merely that a major wirehouse wants in. It was the branding and the timing. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said he “didn’t see this coming,” amplifying Eric Balchunas’ “SHOCKER” reaction to the filings. Seyffart then pointed to Matt Hougan’s framing of what made it unusual: “Morgan Stanley manages 20 ETFs, but mostly under the Calvert/Parametric/Eaton Vance brands. These will be the 3rd and 4th ETFs to bear the ‘Morgan Stanley’ brand. Pretty remarkable.” Park, the head of alpha strategies at Bitwise and ProCap CIO, argues the late-cycle entry is precisely why the filing matters. “It is unheard of for a vanilla ETF product to launch two years after the first to market has already secured the liquidity throne,” he wrote. “IAU famously tried a year later, and never caught up.” Park’s point was that Morgan Stanley wouldn’t make that bet unless internal channels were flashing something the broader market still underestimates. Why This Is ‘The Most Bullish Thing’ For Bitcoin Park framed the filing as a total addressable market story, not a product story. “It means the market is MUCH bigger than even crypto professionals anticipated, especially to reach NEW customers,” he said. “This signals that despite IBIT being the fastest ETF in history to reach $80Bn in AUM (roughly 1/5th the time it took for second place VOO), there is enough untapped interest as viably researched and ascertained through MS’ proprietary wealth channels that they are willing to bet that a branded product has commercial viability.” He finished that thought with the kind of line that reads like a thesis statement for 2026: “It means we are still so early.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Wins As Trump Pumps GDP, Suppresses Oil: Arthur Hayes The “why now” also fits with Seyffart’s longer-running view that institutional platforms would eventually shift. “I’ve been saying for literal years that most of these firms will change their tune on crypto,” he wrote. “But it really was just a couple months ago that Morgan Stanley advisors were barred from buying crypto ETFs for their clients.” In other words: the timeline is compressing, and the posture is moving from cautious access to product ownership. Park’s second argument is that Morgan Stanley is treating Bitcoin as an identity product as much as an allocation sleeve. “It means that Bitcoin is ‘socially’ important just as much as it is ‘financially’ important as a product to offer to customers,” he wrote. “Consider the fact that for being ‘digital gold’ there are virtually no branded gold ETFs in existence, yet for Bitcoin there is.” In his view, that difference is the tell: a house-branded Bitcoin ETF isn’t only about exposure, it’s about what the firm signals to clients and recruits by having it at all. Park argued the branding functions as a credibility marker with a specific audience in mind. “This is because every asset manager knows that having a Bitcoin ETF communicates that they are forward thinking, young, and a little edgy that allows targeting the most challenging investor cohort that everyone wants to reach: UHNW Independent Investors,” he said.“ Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates Improve, But Signal Still Not Decisive: Glassnode Morgan Stanley is making the bet that even if their ETF doesn’t scale to blockbuster success, there’s an intangible benefit that will help build their clout.” The third pillar is defensive: platform economics. “It is at the core a defensive move against platform disintermediation and fee leakage,” Park wrote. “By launching their own BTC ETF after IBIT already consolidated liquidity, Morgan Stanley is implicitly acknowledging a hard truth: DISTRIBUTION owns the customer, not product superiority.” He added why that matters strategically: “They are not going to let advisors default to third parties by outsourcing the economic rent. That’s why at first glance while this launch looks irrational through a pure AUM lens, also totally inevitable through a PLATFORM ECONOMICS lens.” That logic also surfaced in Seyffart’s exchange with James Van Straten, who asked why anyone would be surprised if a firm has “own distribution” and “huge demand from clients.” Seyffart’s answer didn’t dispute demand; it underscored that Morgan Stanley historically “doesn’t do a ton of ETF launches,” and that the decision to do so here is itself informative, even if, as he put it, “there’s plenty of demand” for many products that platforms never bother to manufacture. On timing, Seyffart said approval is “at least 75 days from now,” emphasizing that 75 days can be the fastest possible path under current processes, but also that “there’s plenty of products that don’t launch right at 75 days.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,256.

    "title": "XRP Named The ‘New Cryptocurrency Darling’ After Strong Start Of The Year",
    "body": "Following a remarkable performance in the first trading days of the year, CNBC anchors have named XRP the breakout trade of 2026, arguing that it has been the silent outperformer during the recent crypto market volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin At A Crossroads: $93,500 Reclaim Holds The Key For Next Move XRP Becomes The Hottest Trade Of The Year CNBC’s Brian Sullivan highlighted XRP’s strong start to the year, calling the cryptocurrency the “new cryptocurrency darling” of 2026 and placing it ahead of the market’s leading assets. During the Power Lunch segment, the network’s anchor affirmed that “the hottest crypto trade of the year is not Bitcoin, it is not Ether, it is XRP,” arguing that there’s “big money behind this trade.” In his initial remarks, he pointed out the altcoin’s remarkable seven-day rally toward the recent highs. XRP has seen a notable performance since the start of the year, climbing over 30% from its yearly opening to its two-month high of $2.41 on Tuesday morning. Amid this recent performance, the altcoin recently flipped BNB again to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a place it had lost during the December market volatility. Moreover, it has outperformed most of the largest cryptocurrencies in the weekly timeframe, including BTC’s and ETH’s 4.3% and 6.2% respective rallies. CNBC’s MacKenzie Sigalos weighed in on XRP’s performance on various segments, affirming that “XRP has been the quiet outperformer for months now.” She addressed whether XRP is taking its place as “the next cool thing to know about” or whether it has a different and more relevant use case that sets it apart from the leading cryptocurrencies, emphasizing its role in cross-border payments as one of its key appeals. What’s Driving The Rally? Sigalos cited three main reasons for the strong star-of-the-year performance. First, she stated that “the regulatory overhang has finally cleared as Ripple has fully wrapped up its SEC fight as of August 2nd.” Second, she asserted that people consider the cryptocurrency “a less crowded trade than Bitcoin or Ether,” which “proved out to be true” just in the first trading days of January. For the third reason, she pointed out that “the flows have held up even during the Q4 dip,” arguing that investors continued to add to XRP-based funds, while the largest crypto ETFs’ flows fell with the price. Well, it’s actually been interesting is that during the doldrums of Q4, you actually saw a lot of people piling into those XRP ETFs, which is the exact opposite of what happens with the spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, where people really move in tandem with the price of the coin. But it was the fact that it is a way to have a higher percentage jump. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Q1 Outlook: Analyst Shares Historical Setup As Price Nears Key Resistance Notably, XRP funds had a remarkable performance since their launch in Q4 2025. The investment products, which first debuted in November, have recorded cumulative net inflows of $1.25 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. The ETF category has not recorded a single day of negative net flows in nearly two months, with consistent inflows since going live. During the first three trading days of the year, XRP funds have seen a total inflow of $78.81 million. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $2.19, a 20% increase in the weekly timeframe.

    "body": "In the lead-up to the potential passage of the crypto market structure bill, known as the CLARITY Act, Faryar Shirzad, Chief Policy Officer at Coinbase, shed light on the ongoing discussions surrounding key provisions of the already enacted GENIUS Act. GENIUS Act Under Fire Shirzad noted that the stablecoin rewards provisions of the GENIUS Act are currently a central topic of debate among lawmakers. Shiraz remarked, “reopening it now only creates uncertainty and risks the future of the US Dollar as commerce moves onchain.” Shirzad emphasized the importance of protecting the GENIUS Act, arguing that rewards benefit consumers without adversely affecting community banks. Related Reading: Solana Shatters Records: 2025 Annual Review Reveals New All-Time Highs In Key Metrics He alleged that the motivation behind banks’ opposition to stablecoin rewards is evident. He claimed that US banks currently generate approximately $176 billion annually from the $3 trillion they hold at the Federal Reserve (Fed) and another $187 billion from card swipe fees, which averages to nearly $1,440 for each household. This results in over $360 billion yearly from payments and deposits, in addition to substantial unused lending capacity, as the Federal Reserve incentivizes banks to maintain reserves rather than deploy them. According to Shirzad, stablecoin rewards pose a challenge to these financial margins—not by impeding banks’ ability to lend, but by introducing real competition in payment systems. Shirzad further expressed alarm at how, during these Senate discussions, China has recognized the opportunity presented by the bank lobby. The country has recently announced interest payments to users of its Digital Yuan, aiming to undermine the supremacy of the US dollar. He warned that banning rewards in the Senate would inadvertently aid China’s efforts to challenge the dollar’s dominance. Concluding his remarks, Shirzad asserted that the opposition from banks toward stablecoin rewards is not based on prudential concerns but stems from a desire to protect lucrative revenue streams threatened by competition. Deaton Critiques ABA’s Threat To Stablecoin Rewards John E. Deaton — attorney for XRP holders in the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple Labs and a former Senate candidate — also reacted to these developments. He emphasized the importance of the situation as China officially began offering interest on the digital yuan. He highlighted that the American Bankers Association (ABA) is exerting pressure on the Senate to close a “third-party loophole” in the GENIUS Act, which would restrict companies like Coinbase (COIN) and Kraken from offering rewards to consumers.

Deaton argued that banning American firms from providing yield to everyday citizens does not protect banks, as claimed by the ABA; rather, it risks forcing global reliance on China’s currency over the US dollar. He emphasized that major banks are threatened by the concept of digital dollars because they are unable to “rent” that money back to consumers if individuals are earning yield themselves. The criticism also extended to banking officials, with Deaton asserting that the Banking Policy Institute, led by figures like Jamie Dimon, has crafted an anti-crypto bill last year that undermines the interests of average Americans. He contended that if the Senate capitulates to the bank lobby, it effectively imposes a hidden tax on retail investors and customers nationwide to safeguard Wall Street’s profits.

    "title": "Bitcoin Bounce A Bull Trap? Analyst Sees 2022-Style Bear Flag",
    "body": "A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how the recent Bitcoin price action could echo the bear flag formation from the 2021-22 period. Bitcoin May Be Inside A Bear Flag Right Now In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a similarity that has been emerging between the Bitcoin price trend from 2021-22 and that from 2025-26. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Nears Neutral As Price Recovers Below is the chart shared by Martinez that puts the two periods side-by-side. As is visible in the graph, Bitcoin saw a 54% drawdown during the first half of 2021, before witnessing another leg of the bull run to a new all-time high (ATH) above $69,000 later in the year. This high was followed by a bearish shift, with the price quickly sliding off as 2022 arrived. In 2022, the cryptocurrency observed consolidation inside a technical analysis (TA) pattern known as a Bear Flag. As the name suggests, Flag patterns look like a flag on a pole. In the case of a Bear Flag, the setup is oriented in the reverse direction; an initial sharp downward move represents the “pole,” while a parallel consolidation channel makes up for the “flag.” When the asset is trading inside the flag, it finds support at the lower level of the channel and resistance at the upper one. A break out of either of these bounds can signal a sustained move in that direction. Flags are considered to be continuation patterns, meaning that breakouts from them are likely to lead into the same direction as the preceding price trend. That is, a breakout could occur in the same direction as the pole. From the chart, it’s apparent that this appears to be what happened with Bitcoin back in 2022, with the price escaping downward from the Bear Flag with a sharp crash. Jumping to the recent Bitcoin price action, the cryptocurrency saw a similar trajectory in 2025 as in 2021, with an initial leg of the bull run leading to a second one that resulted in a new ATH (this time above $126,000). One difference, however, was that the legs of this bull market were separated by a price decline of just 30%. Since the latest record, BTC has once again faced a bearish transition, with its price plummeting to a low in November and beginning a period of consolidation. The analyst thinks that the latest phase of sideways movement could be occurring inside a Bear Flag, similar to the one from 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates Improve, But Signal Still Not Decisive: Glassnode It now remains to be seen whether the cryptocurrency’s trajectory is indeed similar this time around as well or if the two cycles will diverge. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen a setback in its recovery as its price has dropped back to $91,000. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Whales Wake Up: $100,000+ Transfers Hit 3-Month High",
    "body": "XRP Ledger whale activity spiked sharply at the start of the week, with on-chain data provider Santiment flagging a surge in large-value transfers that pushed the network to its highest $100,000+ transaction count in roughly three months, a setup the firm says typically coincides with elevated volatility. XRP Whales Are Waking Up Again “XRP Ledger has seen a major increase in whale transactions (moved valued at $100K or more on the network),” Santiment wrote in a post on Wednesday via X alongside a Sanbase chart. “Monday saw 2,170 of them, and yesterday shot all the way up to 2,802 (a 3-month high). Volatility should be higher than usual.” The chart, labeled “XRP $1M+ & $100K+ Whale Transactions Per Day,” highlights two specific data points for the $100K+ threshold: 2,170 transactions on Jan. 5, 2026 and 2,802 transactions on Jan. 6, 2026. The Jan. 6 print is marked as the local peak and, per Santiment’s commentary, the strongest reading in approximately three months, the highest shown since the infamous October 10 liquidation event. Related Reading: XRP Rally Reopens The $8–$12 Zone Debate, Says Will Taylor While Santiment’s post spotlights $100K+ transfers, the chart also tracks $1 million-plus whale transactions. That series suggests large-holder activity picked up across multiple size bands into the early-January move, with $1 million transactions pushing to a one-month high, the strongest reading since early December. The jump stands out because $1 million-plus activity appears to have been comparatively muted through most of December, especially when set against the mid-October to November stretch, when the chart shows more frequent days with higher counts. Related Reading: XRP Sees Back-to-Back Liquidation Waves: Binance Absorbs Majority Of Liquidations In practical market terms, traders tend to watch bursts in large on-chain transfers for what they might represent rather than treating the raw counts as a directional signal. Spikes can reflect accumulation or distribution, internal treasury movements by large entities, exchange-related transfers, or positioning around liquidity events. What they often share is mechanical impact: when large holders move size, the probability of sharper intraday swings tends to increase, particularly if that activity persists over multiple sessions. XRP Also Re-Enters The Social ‘Trending’ Set The whale-transaction alert landed alongside a separate Santiment update that placed XRP among the assets seeing the biggest jumps in discussion across social channels. In that post, Santiment grouped XRP with Solana, Ethereum, Bitcoin, MicroStrategy, and Litecoin as the day’s top “trending” tickers by changes in conversation volume for Wednesday. For XRP specifically, Santiment said the discussion mix leaned heavily institutional in tone: ETF flows, “record-breaking net assets,” and the idea of XRP as a high-beta trade into 2025–2026 narratives while also referencing perceived regulatory clarity after the SEC case resolution and use cases such as bridge activity for stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets. Those claims were presented as themes circulating in social chatter rather than as independently verified developments in the post itself. At press time, XRP traded at $2.127.

    "title": "Bitcoin Absorbs The Flush: Quantum Structure Signals Wave (3) Toward $104,000",
    "body": "Bitcoin has absorbed a sharp sell-off and stabilized at key support, signaling that buyers are firmly in control. With the market holding its structure, insights from Quantum Models suggest that Wave (3) is underway, pointing toward a near-term target around $104,000. Q-Structure Confluence Holds Firm, Keeping The Bullish Bias Alive Elliott Chart, in a recent update, highlighted that Bitcoin remains firmly supported around the Q-Structure λ₅ confluence zone, a level that continues to underpin the broader bullish outlook. This support area has absorbed selling pressure, suggesting that larger participants are still defending key levels despite recent volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dips Further, Setting Up a High-Stakes Support Moment Upon closer examination of market structure, the recent pullback is now being classified as a complex corrective phase rather than the beginning of a larger downtrend. Specifically, the correction is interpreted as Intermediate Wave (2), unfolding through a Zigzag W | Zigzag X | Triangle Y setup. With this corrective pattern largely resolved, Elliott Chart highlights that Intermediate Wave (3) is now in progress, with Minor Waves 1 and 2 already taking shape. This suggests the market is building the foundation for a more decisive move higher. The critical piece still developing is an impulsive Minor Wave 3. Historically, this wave tends to be the strongest and most aggressive part of an advance. If it unfolds as expected, the model points to a near-term Q-Target around $104,444, generated using the Q-Structure λᵣ projection. This bullish scenario is derived from insights within the Quantum Models framework and is not based on short-term noise. Notably, this potential trend reversal was first projected back on November 15, during Bitcoin’s decline. Sharp Flush Finds Strong Demand At Key Levels Delving into current price actions, CyrilXBT disclosed that Bitcoin experienced a sharp flush but found buyers precisely at a critical support level, allowing the price to stabilize and gradually grind higher. This reaction indicates that the recent sell-off was absorbed by strong demand rather than driven by panic selling, reflecting healthy market participation from buyers at key zones. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Recovery Extends Into 2026 as Charts Hint at Another Leg Higher This type of price action highlights absorption, not fear. What stands out most is the higher-low structure that has emerged following the drop. This formation is important because it signals that downside pressure is weakening. As long as Bitcoin continues to hold within this reclaimed range, the risk of a deeper sell-off diminishes, and the market maintains the potential for further upward moves. Sideways or consolidating price action at these levels is constructive for the overall crypto market. Maintaining this structure sets the stage for a healthier, more sustainable advance for Bitcoin rather than a rushed or volatile rebound. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Ethereum Validators Face Multi-Week Wait As Staking Participation Rises",
    "body": "The Ethereum staking ecosystem is showing clear signs of tightening as demand for validators continues to rise. Participants now face a multi-week wait to enter the network. This growing staking queue reflects a structural shift in how ETH is being held and deployed less as a liquid supply and more as long-term productive capital. As more ETH becomes locked in validation, the dynamics of supply, yield, and network security are quietly being reshaped. Why Validator Delays Add Friction To Supply Re-Entry The current state of Ethereum staking highlights a growing problem with predictability. Crypto expert Dave has pointed out on X that the ETH staking entry queue is now showing an estimated wait of 25 days and 4 hours to enter. Previously, the wait time was around 7.55 days, which is a more than threefold increase in wait time over a relatively short period. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Deposits Just Surpassed Withdrawals, Why This Could Send ETH Price Above $4,000 At the same time, the exit queue is reporting a wait time of 14 minutes, which previously sat for 44.25 days, representing a reduction of well over 4,000 times, from weeks to minutes. According to Dave, staking on a blockchain with this level of variance between entry and exit requirements is uncertain. Waiting weeks to enter while exit clears almost instantly makes staking behavior highly state-dependent and unpredictable. This contract is exactly why the expert prefers staking on Cardano, because there is no entry queue. Also, delegation is reflected on-chain immediately, and stake changes are transparent and deterministic. The only delay is a fixed active stake period of two epochs, which is 10 days before delegation changes take effect. This consistency is the difference because there are no dynamic queues, no sudden shifts, and no surprises driven by changing network states. If demand to stake on Cardano increases rapidly, it will make absolutely no difference, because predictability matters especially with monetary investments. Why Throughput Without Context Is Meaningless The headline claim of $8 trillion in stablecoin transfers on Ethereum sounds impressive, but it’s a completely meaningless metric. Crypto analyst DBCrypto noted that a single entity can move $1 billion back and forth between two wallets ten times, creating a sudden $10 billion in volume, but generating zero economic activity.

However, crypto continues to elevate these numbers as milestones because big figures pump bags. What’s being measured here is motion and activity, not progress or value. DBCrypto concluded that until the industry stops celebrating vanity metrics, it will continue to confuse noise for signal. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",
