    "title": "Pundit Explains Why The XRP Price Hitting $100 Isn’t Delusional",
    "body": "The idea of the XRP price reaching $100 is usually dismissed almost instantly based on arguments of market capitalization and circulating supply. On paper, that math suggests a $100 value would imply a market cap valuation of at least $6 trillion, which is a figure many see as unrealistic when compared to today’s crypto market. Nonetheless, a few XRP enthusiasts are of the notion that such a framework does not apply to XRP. A crypto pundit on X, known as 24HRSCRYPTO, noted that treating XRP like a static store-of-value asset misses the entire point of what the cryptocurrency is designed to do. The Pundit’s Argument: XRP Moves Value, It Doesn’t Store It According to 24HRSCRYPTO, market cap math is misleading when it is used to judge an asset like XRP, which is designed for high-velocity settlement. 24HRSCRYPTO is an XRPL validator and fervent XRP supporter that’s always calling for ultra-bullish price targets for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Crypto Traders Share Odds Of XRP Price Rising 40% This Year, Can It Still Rally? In his words, market capitalization assumes an asset stores value, whereas a global liquidity asset moves value. XRP, from this perspective, is not meant to warehouse trillions of dollars but to facilitate the rapid movement of capital across systems, borders, and currencies. Based on this logic, if XRP is used to free trapped capital and settle transactions at scale, the same units of liquidity can be reused repeatedly within a short period of time with huge demand. Price, then, reflects the demand plus the level of trust placed in the system and the volume of economic weight it is clearing, not how much money is sitting still. Under that framework, static market cap comparisons are a poor proxy for what XRP could be valued at in a fully deployed global settlement role. With this in mind, 24HRSCRYPTO noted that XRP at $100 isn’t delusional; it’s reality. Why Market Cap Math Dominates The $100 Debate The skepticism around a $100 XRP price comes from straightforward math. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $1.92 and is about 5,100% away from reaching $100. XRP currently has a circulating supply of 60.85 billion tokens, and multiplying that supply by $100 produces a $6 trillion market cap, which is larger than the current market cap of the entire crypto market. Related Reading: XRP Funding Rates And Spot Volume Tell An Interesting Story For Price Market cap is treated as a hard ceiling based on this angle. The assumption is that for XRP to trade at $100, trillions of dollars would need to sit idle inside its market cap at the same time. That logic works reasonably well in theory for XRP. However, 24HRSCRYPTO is of the notion that the logic is for crypto assets like Bitcoin, whose primary function is holding value, and the assumption breaks down when applied to a liquidity-focused network asset. However, this claim does not, in fact, guarantee that XRP can trade at $100 without the cumulative market cap of circulating tokens reflecting such an amount.

    "title": "OKX Launches Crypto Payment Card Across the European Economic Area",
    "body": "OKX has announced the launch of the OKX Card in Europe, expanding its payments footprint across the European Economic Area. The product allows users to pay with stablecoins at merchants that accept Mastercard, positioning crypto balances for direct everyday use rather than requiring prior conversion or preloaded fiat balances. Related Reading: XRP Derivatives Reset: Open Interest Drops Nearly 60% From July Peak The announcement comes at a time when crypto infrastructure is increasingly intersecting with traditional financial rails. While price action across major assets remains volatile, platforms are continuing to build payment and settlement tools aimed at reducing friction between on-chain assets and real-world spending. Rather than introducing a new payment concept, OKX is formalizing an existing demand: using stablecoins as a transactional medium within regulated environments. The broader relevance of the launch lies less in novelty and more in how crypto-native mechanics—such as self-custody and on-chain settlement—are being adapted to conventional consumer payment formats. Crypto Payments, DeFi, and TradFi Convergence According to the details released by OKX, the OKX Card enables direct stablecoin payments without requiring users to manually convert assets or preload funds. Stablecoins remain in the user’s wallet until purchase, when conversion occurs at checkout. The card charges no transaction or FX fees and applies a stated 0.4% market spread when converting stablecoins to euros. It is issued via a licensed European payments partner and operates under standard AML and KYC requirements within the EEA. The card supports Apple Pay and Google Pay, and functions anywhere the Mastercard network is accepted. OKX also confirmed a limited rewards program, offering crypto-denominated cashback during the initial launch period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives Pressure Hits 30-Day Extreme, Price Refuses To Break This launch reflects a broader trend: firms are repackaging DeFi infrastructure into TradFi-facing products. These companies now embed core DeFi elements—self-custody, on-chain settlement, and stablecoin liquidity—directly into regulated consumer tools like payment cards. This does not replace DeFi, but extends its utility beyond native crypto environments. DeFi is no longer only an alternative system running in parallel, but a backend layer increasingly integrated into traditional financial interfaces. OKB Consolidates After Sharp 2025 Repricing OKB is trading near $107 on the daily chart, consolidating after a sharp repricing cycle that unfolded in the second half of 2025. The structure reflects a classic post-rally digestion phase rather than active trend continuation. After peaking above the $220–$240 area, the price entered a prolonged corrective move that erased a large portion of the prior advance and shifted market control back toward sellers. From a trend perspective, the moving averages define the current regime clearly. OKB remains below the 50-day moving average (blue), which has turned down and continues to cap upside attempts. The 100-day moving average (green) is also sloping lower, reinforcing a zone of layered resistance between roughly $120 and $135. In contrast, the 200-day moving average (red) is still rising and currently sits just below price, acting as a key medium-to-long-term support reference.

While volume has declined materially compared to the distribution phase near the highs. This combination points to market equilibrium, not aggressive selling pressure.

    "title": "XRP Could Enter New Growth Phase After Clarity Act Decision — Here’s How",
    "body": "XRP may be approaching a pivotal turning point as regulatory uncertainty is moving closer to resolution with the upcoming Clarity Act decision. If the Clarity Act establishes a clearer framework, XRP could unlock fresh capital flows, renewed exchange participation, and broader integration across the financial platforms. This moment could represent the transition from consolidation to a new phase of sustained growth. How Clear Rules Could Reshape XRP Market Perception The passing of the Clarity Art will trigger XRP to go absolutely parabolic. An analyst known as Bird has highlighted on X that the Clarity Art is designed to make the rules of crypto regulation straightforward. It will tell in the market which digital assets will be legally allowed and which are not. As the resolution inches closer, XRP has already been tested in court and was not classified as an illegal security. Related Reading: What Does XRP Really Do? Expert Explains What It Is Built For Thus, when the rules become clear across the entire crypto market, companies, banks, and investors can finally use and hold XRP without worrying about regulatory backlash. These clear rules mean more trust, more capital, and more use for XRP. Bird’s view is that this is exactly why the court case was meant to happen, because it has positioned XRP to front-run every other digital asset. While retail traders are watching the price, banks and institutions are positioning for it. Crypto analyst LukeSuther pointed out that the XRP price action is being deliberately constrained, not out of bad faith, but out of necessity, because participants can’t migrate global settlement infrastructure into a market that’s still fully volatile and speculative. Before true price discovery can happen, regulation, liquidity corridors, compliance frameworks, and integration with legacy financial systems must be in place. However, if XRP were already operating in a completely open, utility-driven market, LukeSuther argues that it wouldn’t be trading at $2.00. Instead, the price will remain compressed while the institutions load and the rails are being built. Why Infrastructure Matters More Than Market Narrative The founder of Lux Lions NFT and host of the Crypto Blitz YouTube show, RipBullWinkle, stated that what started as a digital asset experiment is now evolving into real capital markets infrastructure. Brad Garlinghouse and Tony Edward break down XRP’s institutional adoption trajectory during an X Spaces discussion. Related Reading: XRP Advances As A Recognized Digital Asset In Regulated Markets — Here’s How According to RipBullWinkle, the conversation wasn’t about price targets. Rather, it was about real-world utility in the cross-border settlements and liquidity infrastructure that traditional finance is quietly integrating into the blockchain-based rails. While the market is busy chasing narratives, foundations are being built in public view. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "What’s Going On With The US Dollar And How Does It Affect Bitcoin, Ethereum Prices?",
    "body": "The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices rallied after reports of the US dollar crashing spread across the market. Recent data show that the US dollar has fallen to its lowest level in four years, raising concerns about the strength of the world’s dominant reserve currency. As the dollar weakens, market players are beginning to shift attention to alternative assets such as precious metals and digital currencies, including BTC, which is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against rising inflation and currency depreciation. US Dollar Falls To Lows Not Seen In 4 Years New reports from Bloomberg highlight the relentless slide in the US dollar index (DXY) over recent weeks, with the price tumbling further after President Donald Trump’s comments on the currency’s performance. Sources reveal that Trump said the dollar is “doing great,” despite its ongoing downturn. Related Reading: Analyst Says Chainlink Price Could Crash 50% If This Level Fails Traders interpreted the President’s seemingly indifferent response to the declining dollar as a signal that the slide could continue, triggering further selling pressure. Data from the web-based stock market research platform Finviz shows that, as of writing, the US dollar index has crashed to 95.92 from a previous level near 100. This marks its weakest level in nearly four years, specifically since 2022. Additionally, Bloomberg reported that its Dollar Spot Index also recorded its lowest four-day decline since Trump announced new tariffs in April 2025. Traders in the $9.5 trillion per-day currency markets are also increasingly betting that the dollar could decline further, as US policy risks weigh on the world’s primary reserve currency. Amidst the decline in the US dollar index, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are posting gains. BTC’s price rose above $89,000, while Ethereum has climbed more than 3% to reach above $3,000, in the past 24 hours. This simultaneous rally in cryptocurrencies alongside the weakening US dollar suggests that investors may be shifting capital to risk-on assets. Market analyst ‘Master of Crypto’ recently outlined several reasons behind the continued decline in the weakening US dollar in a post on X. He explained that large budget deficits, the FED’s challenge of balancing inflation control with job market stability, steady bond supply, and FX hedging activities are keeping the US dollar near recent lows. According to him, in this type of market environment, holding idle cash becomes a significant risk for investors. Related Reading: Here’s How Much XRP Ripple Execs Have Dumped So Far Possible Implications For The Bitcoin And Ethereum Price Historically, periods of US dollar weakness have often coincided with rallies in Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies. When the dollar declines, investors sometimes seek alternative assets to preserve value. This can increase demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are viewed by many as alternative stores of value and risk-on assets. While this correlation is not a clear indication of a potential cryptocurrency rally, analysts like ‘Milk Road Macro’ suggest that the declining dollar could help support a broader crypto market recovery. He said that as the dollar weakens, capital will flow into precious metals like gold and silver. Soon after, this same capital is expected to rotate into BTC, potentially fueling a price rebound.

    "title": "Here’s Why The Hyperliquid Price Is Exploding Again",
    "body": "The Hyperliquid price is seeing renewed bullish momentum, recording double gains over the last week and bucking the broader crypto market downtrend. This comes thanks to bullish fundamentals in the token’s ecosystem, including a rise in open interest on the decentralized exchange (DEX). Why The Hyperliquid Price Is Rising The Hyperliquid price is up over 58% in the last seven days, outpacing the broader crypto market as Bitcoin trades just below the psychological $90,000 level. This price surge has come on the back of a rise in Hyperliquid’s HIP-3 open interest. The DEX announced in an X post that open interest reached an all-time high of $790 million, driven recently by a surge in commodities trading. Related Reading: XRP, HBAR, And Litecoin: Pundit Highlights Coins To Watch In 2026 The exchange added that HIP-3’s open interest has been hitting new all-time highs each week, after being just $260 million a month ago. HIP-3 enables anyone to launch a custom perpetual market for crypto, commodities such as gold and silver, and other assets such as stocks. Thanks to this upgrade, the DEX is seeing increased trading activity, which has led to a surge in the Hyperliquid price. Notably, the Hyperliquid price has benefited from the precious metals boom, with the silver perpetuals market on the DEX seeing massive trading activity. CoinGecko data shows that the Silver perpetuals market is the third-largest traded in the last 24 hours, behind Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a trading volume of just over $1 billion. In an X post, Hyperliquid’s co-founder Jeff Yan noted that the DEX has achieved an important milestone of becoming the most liquid venue for crypto price discovery in the world. This came as he highlighted the order books for BTC perps on Binance and his DEX. He added that Hyperliquid has also grown to become the most liquid venue for perps on traditional-finance (TradFi) assets. Little Selling Pressure And Huge Buying Pressure For HYPE In an X post, Hyperliquid stakeholder Henrik noted that the Hyperliquid price is also rising as major selling pressure is gone. On the other hand, HYPE is seeing significant demand, including from digital asset treasuring companies such as Hyperliquid Strategies. He further highlighted the imminent Kraken HYPE listing, which is also bullish for the token. Meanwhile, Henrik stated that Hyperliquid dominates all trading metrics, including volume and open interest. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Prices Are Still Crashing Hard The increase in the DEX’s trading activity is also significant and bullish for the Hyperliquid price, as the majority of fees earned on the protocol are directed to the Assistance Fund, which is used to buy back HYPE tokens on the open market. DeFiLlama data shows that the DEX is currently among the top five protocols by fees generated over the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the Hyperliquid price is at around $34, up over 27% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Medium, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "South Dakota has a new bill on the table that would let the state put up to 10% of certain public funds into Bitcoin. Reports say Rep. Logan Manhart filed House Bill 1155 this week, restarting an effort that stalled last year. Related Reading: PayPal Survey: 4 In 10 US Merchants Now Accept Crypto The measure would change state investment rules to give the State Investment Council explicit authority to hold Bitcoin in its portfolio. Lawmaker Files Bill For Bitcoin Reserve According to filings and public posts, Manhart’s proposal mirrors a move he tried in 2025 and keeps a clear cap on exposure: 10% of the moneys made available for investment. The bill text says the limit “may not exceed 10%” and lays out options for how the exposure could be taken, including direct holdings or regulated products. A South Dakota lawmaker is reviving a push to bring bitcoin into state finances. Republican Rep. Logan Manhart introduced House Bill 1155, which would allow the state to invest up to 10% of eligible public funds in bitcoin. It’s a renewed effort after a similar bill stalled… pic.twitter.com/hPBbiSB6zT — Timmy Shen (@timmyhmshen) January 28, 2026 The new push comes after last year’s proposal was deferred in committee. Reports note that HB 1202 was put aside during the 2025 session and did not advance, and Manhart signaled he would try again in 2026. That history matters because it shows the idea has support in some corners but also faces practical and political hurdles. What The Bill Allows Based on reports, the bill not only sets a 10% ceiling but also tries to handle custody and security concerns. It mentions requirements such as using qualified custodians or exchange-traded products, encrypted storage, and multi-signature controls. Those rules are aimed at lowering the risks that come with holding a volatile asset with public money. Supporters say Bitcoin could act as a hedge and add a new type of asset to the state’s mix. Opponents point to volatility and possible legal or accounting issues when state funds are used in this way. Related Reading: Record Pain: Bitcoin Investors Suffer $4.5B Loss, Most In 3 Years The debate will likely hinge on how the State Investment Council evaluates risk and which funds would be considered “eligible” under the bill’s language. Political And Financial Pushback There is practical pushback from fiscal watchdogs and some lawmakers who worry about public perception. Money managed for things like pensions carries duty of care. That duty was stressed last session and will be raised again now that the bill is back. The point has been made plainly and will shape committee hearings.

    "title": "Bitcoin Supply In Loss Turns Upward—Early Bear Market Signal?",
    "body": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Supply in Loss indicator has witnessed a shift in direction that has often led into bearish phases in past cycles. 365-Day SMA Of The Bitcoin Supply In Loss Has Been Rising Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin Supply in Loss has started to trend up again. This metric measures, as its name suggests, the percentage of the total BTC circulating supply that’s currently being held at some net unrealized loss. Related Reading: Next Ethereum Move Hinges On This Level, Says Glassnode Analyst The indicator works by scanning through the transaction history of each token in circulation to determine the price at which it was last transacted on the network. If this previous transaction value for any coin was greater than the latest spot price, then the metric assumes that particular token to be underwater. The Supply in Loss adds up all coins falling in this category and finds what part of the supply they make up for. A counterpart metric known as the Supply in Profit tracks the supply of the opposite type. Since the total supply must add up to a 100%, however, the Supply in Profit is simply equal to the Supply in Loss subtracted from 100. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 365-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Bitcoin Supply in Loss over the cryptocurrency’s history: As displayed in the above graph, the 365-day SMA Bitcoin Supply in Loss plummeted to the lowest point for the cycle back in October. This plunge came as the asset rallied to a new all-time high (ATH) beyond the $126,000 level. Since the low, however, the indictor has witnessed a rapid climb, a consequence of the bearish momentum that BTC has faced following its ATH. So far, the indicator hasn’t risen to a significant level compared to past capitulation levels, but the change in direction has been solidifying itself. “Historically, this shift has marked the early phase of bear markets, when losses begin to spread beyond short-term holders and gradually reach longer-term participants,” explained the quant. From the chart, it’s visible that bearish transitions in past cycles occurred as the indicator shot up, with a high value in it coinciding with the cycle bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin Social Interest Fades As Retail Chases Gold, Silver Hype Whether the recent reversal in the Supply in Loss is the beginning of something similar only remains to be seen. Earlier in this cycle, an upward turn in the indicator ended up only being temporary, as the H1-2025 drawdown gave way to renewed bullish momentum rather than a prolonged bear phase. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $89,000, up over 1% in the last 24 hours. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView.com",

About 75% of that stock is said to be actively put to work onchain. Reports say the Flare vault system shows 90.55 million XRP in its core vault after inflows and outflows were counted, and the FXRP wrapper is reported to hold 91.67 million tokens with a 100% reserve ratio.

Activity has been recorded across a set of strategies and the wrapped FXRP is being moved into other protocols. That activity has been supported by a vault system built by Upshift, which automates yield processes and applies predefined risk controls. Reports indicate that returns are generated through a mix of onchain strategies, though details on how those yields may change over time have not been fully outlined. Based on past market patterns, yield levels across crypto platforms have tended to decline once incentive programs are reduced. At the same time, the use of bridges and smart contracts introduces added technical complexity, which has previously led to disruptions and losses across the sector. Where The Yield Comes From Reports note that other firms have adopted similar models. Axelar and Hex Trust are among those that issued wrapped XRP tools that earn returns when deployed. That means multiple places are trying to make XRP productive.

GTreasury, acquired by Ripple for $1 billion in October, launched a product called Ripple Treasury this month.

    "body": "Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $2,880 zone but it failed near $3,050. ETH is declining and might struggle to stay above $2,920. Ethereum failed to stay above $3,000 and started a fresh decline. The price is trading below $2,990 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $3,000 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $2,880 zone. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price managed to remain stable above $2,880 and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to clear the $2,920 and $2,950 resistance levels. The bulls even pumped the price above $3,000. However, the bears remained active near $3,050 . A high was formed at $3,040 and the price started another decline. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent upward move from the $2,784 swing low to the $3,040 high. Besides, there was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $3,000 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,980 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls remain in action above $2,920, the price could attempt another increase. Immediate resistance is seen near the $2,980 level. The first key resistance is near the $3,000 level. The next major resistance is near the $3,050 level. A clear move above the $3,050 resistance might send the price toward the $3,120 resistance. An upside break above the $3,120 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,180 resistance zone or even $3,200 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,000 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,920 level. The first major support sits near the $2,880 zone or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent upward move from the $2,784 swing low to the $3,040 high. A clear move below the $2,880 support might push the price toward the $2,820 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,780 region. The main support could be $2,740.

    "title": "‘Paper’ Bitcoin Isn’t Suppressing Price – Silver Shows Why, Jeff Park Says",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s unusually subdued options pricing and weak month-to-date activity are setting up what ProCap CIO and Bitwise adviser Jeff Park calls a dangerous asymmetry: upside momentum is unlikely without volatility, and the longer BTC stays “quiet,” the more violent the eventual move could be. In a post via X on Jan.27, Park described the current tape as “still a trader’s market,” arguing that low implied volatility and thin participation are a poor foundation for a clean grind higher. “It is very unlikely for Bitcoin to find momentum to the upside without experiencing significantly higher volatility,” he wrote. “The fact that we are at ~38 IV combined with horrible volume MTD gives me pause (lower than ANY month of 2025, and especially bad for January in general) when you can see what the metals complex is doing. You literally can’t imagine a worse set up for disappointment.” What Happened In Silver And Why It Could Repeat For Bitcoin Park’s reference point is a silver market that has gone from strong to disorderly. Silver prices have surged above $117 per ounce on Monday, with reports pointing to a speculative bid layered on top of tight physical conditions and heavy retail participation via bars, coins, and physically backed ETFs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Won’t Break Out Until The Fed Steps Into Yen/JGB Chaos: Arthur Hayes The move also featured a sharp single-day jump. On Jan. 26, the most-active silver futures contract rose 14%, the largest one-day gain since 1985. That price action coincided with a staggering surge in trading and options activity across silver vehicles. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the scale: “WHOA: The volume in the SLV is $32b.. that 15x its avg and by far the most volume of any security on the planet. For context, SPY is $24b, NVDA and TSLA $16b. Can’t remember the last time something so relatively small took over like this. Game Stop maybe.” WHOA: The volume in the $SLV is $32b.. that 15x its avg and by far the most volume of any security on the planet. For context, $SPY is $24b, $NVDA and $TSLA $16b. Can’t remember the last time something so relatively small took over like this. Game Stop maybe. pic.twitter.com/s6lVajUq4J — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 26, 2026 He later added that SLV “ended up trading $40b worth of shares [on Monday],” adding: “To put that into perspective, that’s more than it traded in all of Q1 last year. Jan + Feb +Mar = $35b. Options volume also in stratosphere. It’s already done $1.5b in pre-market, which is 3x more than any other ETF, 5x more than Tesla, Nvidia. Again, reminds me of Game Stop in its how is this even possible-ness.” “Paper” Exposure As An Accelerant A common crypto refrain is that “synthetic” or “paper” bitcoin suppresses spot price. Park argued the opposite dynamic is often underappreciated and he used silver to illustrate how leverage and market structure can turn into the catalyst. Related Reading: Expert Who Nailed The Bitcoin Top Now Says Buy At These Levels “People often blame incorrectly that ‘synthetic/paper’ bitcoin is the cause of price suppression,” Park wrote. “I have long argued it is quite the opposite, which you can see how it manifests in silver below- Silver didn’t have a 6-sigma event because the spot market was so vibrant.” In his telling, silver’s melt-up wasn’t driven by orderly spot demand; it was driven by the “shenanigans” inside financialized exposure. “Silver’s record-setting meltup comes from all the shenanigans behind ‘paper silver’ where margin rules, leveraged instruments and vehicles, and liquidity and maturity transformation mismatches create tremendous pressure on breaking points where no physical supply can be introduced fast enough to counter the velocity of paper supply,” he said. “For Park, the takeaway is directional but not calendar-specific. “To root for Bitcoin is to root for its volatility,” he wrote. “Anyone who tells you otherwise does not understand the fundamentals of the commodities market … It may not be today or yet tomorrow, but eventually Bitcoin is going to rip many faces off. Volatility or bust.” At press time, BTC traded at $89,430. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Supply In Loss Begins To Rise, Raising Early Bear Market Concerns",
    "body": "Crypto research firm CryptoQuant has flagged a potentially troubling development for Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider digital asset market, pointing to an early warning signal that has historically appeared ahead of prolonged downturns. In a report released Wednesday, the firm noted that Bitcoin’s supply in loss metric has begun to rise again, a shift that has often marked the early stages of past bear markets. Possible Shift Toward Bear Market Structure According to analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Woominkyu, increases in supply held at a loss tend to signal that market weakness is spreading beyond short‑term traders and gradually affecting longer‑term holders. In previous market cycles, including 2014, 2018, and 2022, this indicator started trending upward well before prices reached their eventual lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Braces For FOMC Volatility As History Shows Major Post‑Fed Sell‑Offs During those periods, Bitcoin prices continued to decline even after the metric turned higher, with true market bottoms forming only once supply in loss expanded much further and broader capitulation set in. At present, CryptoQuant notes that Bitcoin’s supply in loss remains well below levels typically associated with full market capitulation. However, the change in direction itself is significant. The analysts say it suggests the market may be shifting into a bearish structural phase, rather than experiencing a brief correction within an ongoing bull market. Bitcoin’s recent price action appears to reflect that uncertainty. The asset is currently trading around $89,700 and has struggled to reclaim the key $90,000 level as support. This follows a steady decline from earlier yearly-highs near $98,000, where upward momentum faded as buying pressure weakened and gains recorded at the start of the year were fully erased. US Dollar Tests Historic Zone For Bitcoin Rallies Despite these cautionary signals, not all analysts believe the outlook is entirely negative. Analysts at Bull Theory have highlighted a potentially bullish catalyst that could emerge in the months ahead, centered on movements in the US dollar. In a recent post on social media platform X (previously Twitter) the firm pointed out that the US Dollar Index is testing the same zone that preceded major Bitcoin bull runs in both 2017 and 2021. According to their analysis, the Dollar Index has broken below a long‑term trendline that has held for roughly 16 years and is now hovering around the critical level of 96. Historically, periods when the DXY fell below 96 and remained there coincided with strong Bitcoin rallies. Related Reading: Crypto Funds Funneled To Money Launderers Hit $82 Billion, According To Chainalysis As seen in the chart below, in mid‑2017, the index dropped under that level, after which Bitcoin surged nearly eightfold over the following five to six months. A similar pattern played out during the 2020 pandemic era. When a wave of liquidity entered financial markets at the time, the DXY again slipped below 96, and Bitcoin went on to rise roughly seven times over the next seven to eight months. During that same period, Ethereum (ETH) and many altcoins posted gains of tenfold or more. For now, the market sits at a crossroads. On‑chain data points to early bear‑market dynamics, while macro signals linked to the US dollar offer a counter‑narrative that could favor renewed strength.

    "title": "Bitcoin Death Cross That Last Preceded A 66% Drop Is Back",
    "body": "A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how Bitcoin has recently formed a technical crossover that preceded bearish shifts in the past. Bitcoin Has Seen A Death Cross Between 21-Day & 50-Day SMAs In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a daily price chart for Bitcoin showcasing a crossover between two simple moving averages (SMAs) that the asset has gone through recently. An SMA is a statistical tool that averages a quantity over a given period of time and that, as its name suggests, updates in time with the quantity. This tool can be useful for studying long-term trends, as it smooths out the graph by eliminating short-term fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Turns Upward—Early Bear Market Signal? SMAs can be taken over any window, but in the context of the current topic, two specific periods are of relevance: 21-day and 50-day. Below is the chart posted by Martinez that shows the trend in these SMAs for Bitcoin over the past decade. From the graph, it’s visible that the daily Bitcoin price has seen its 21-day SMA fall below the 50-day one recently. In the past, this crossover has tended to act as a “death cross” for the cryptocurrency, with its price plunging after the signal’s appearance. In the chart, the analyst has highlighted the previous instances of this death cross. It would appear that the asset experienced drawdowns ranging between 54% and 69% following the crossover. The most recent occurrence of the crossover was in 2022, leading into a price decline of almost 66% to the bear market bottom. Given the past pattern, it only remains to be seen whether the 21-day SMA going below the 50-day SMA will prove to be bearish for Bitcoin this time. In the scenario that bearish momentum does follow for the asset, it could be at risk of breaching below an on-chain level known as the Realized Price-to-Liveliness Ratio. This level represents the ratio between two on-chain indicators: the Realized Price and Liveliness. The first of these tracks the cost basis of the average investor or address on the Bitcoin blockchain, while the latter encapsulates the spending/HODLing behavior of long-term investors. As Martinez has highlighted in another X post, Bitcoin has been trading near the Realized Price-to-Liveliness Ratio recently. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Price-to-Liveliness Ratio is situated around $87,500 right now. BTC briefly fell below this mark during the Sunday dip, but the coin has since recovered back above it. Related Reading: Next Ethereum Move Hinges On This Level, Says Glassnode Analyst “The last time Bitcoin $BTC fell below the Realized Price-to-Liveliness Ratio, it moved toward the Realized Price,” noted the analyst. Currently, the Realized Price is located at $56,000. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $89,500, up 2% in the last seven days.

    "title": "Analysts Say Dogecoin Consolidation Is About To End – Parabolic Run Or Crash Ahead?",
    "body": "As the market bounces from the recent lows, Dogecoin (DOGE) is attempting to turn a crucial area back into support. Some analysts have highlighted that the cryptocurrency could be repeating its past performances, which could lead to a massive move in the coming months. Related Reading: Prediction Markets On BNB Chain Explode As Trading Volume Crosses $20B Dogecoin Repeats Its Parabolic Run Pattern Dogecoin, the largest memecoin by market capitalization, has been trading in the $0.119-$0.151 range over the past month, reaching a one-month high of $0.156 during the early January rally. DOGE retested the range lows over the weekend, holding the key $0.119-$0.120 area as support before bouncing 5% toward the current levels. Now, the cryptocurrency is attempting to reclaim the $0.1250 area to continue its recovery rally. Amid this performance, some market observers affirmed that the memecoin could be near the end of a macro consolidation. Analyst Bitcoinsensus noted that Dogecoin has followed a similar pattern to the upside during previous cycles. The chart shows that after retracing from the previous highs, the cryptocurrency has recorded a long consolidation, followed by a “parabolic run to fresh new highs, when market conditions allow it.” As the analysis noted, previous breakouts from DOGE’s long-term accumulation zones have led to 60x and 215x gains, which could signal that a bigger rally could be brewing if history repeats. Similarly, Trader Tardigrade highlighted that Dogecoin’s current performance in the weekly timeframe mirrors its Q4 2024 breakout, which led to its multi-year high of $0.484. “The structure, duration, and magnitude of the current and previous pullbacks are very similar,” he wrote on X, with a nearly 60% decline from its local highs over 19 weeks. Based on this, the analyst suggested that Dogecoin “might have completed its entire pullback and could propel itself to the next high” in the coming weeks. DOGE Price Risks Another 50% Correction Despite the bullish outlooks, market watcher TradingShot affirmed that DOGE is already deep into its new bear cycle and risks another 50%-70% pullback if selling pressure and market volatility continue. Per the post, Dogecoin is currently supported only by the 350-day Moving Average (MA), which has been holding since the October 2025 flash crash. It noted that “the 1W MA350 in particular is of the utmost importance as it held as Support during both previous Bear Cycles.” As the analysis explained, if this level breaks, the memecoin could enter the second phase of the bear cycle, which potentially targets the $0.060-0.035 zone: This either bottoms on the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level of Doge’s historic Fib Channel Up at around $0.0600 or extends to a full -93.00% decline (as much as the previous two corrected by) around $0.03500. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At Risk Of 50% Correction As BTC’s 2022 Bearish Playbook Repeats TradingShot also highlighted that DOGE’s bottom could be in by Q4 2026, based on the Sine Waves. “According to this, the next bottom should be around October 2026. So whatever price Doge is trading at around that time, we turn again into long-term buyers,” it concluded. As of this writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.125, a 1.4% decline on the weekly timeframe.

    "title": "21Shares Drops 3 XRP Price Predictions For 2026: What’s The Upside?",
    "body": "21Shares has outlined a three-scenario price outlook for XRP in 2026, arguing that the token is moving from a litigation-defined trade to one increasingly priced on ETF-driven demand and measurable on-ledger adoption. In a Jan. 23 research note, 21Shares’ Matt Mena frames 2026 as a “defining turning point” in which XRP’s valuation becomes “anchored in institutional fundamentals” after the August 2025 settlement that ended the SEC case overhang. The firm says that resolution removed a structural constraint that had limited XRP’s upside “regardless of underlying utility,” allowing the market to reprice to a new all-time high of $3.66 and then consolidate with the former $2.00 ceiling acting as support. XRP Price Predictions For 2026 21Shares describes the post-settlement regime as a tougher environment for the asset: less narrative optionality, more accountability. With the legal cloud cleared, the note argues XRP “can no longer rely on courtroom hype or regulatory uncertainty to drive its valuation or excuse underperformance,” introducing a “sell the news” risk if usage fails to scale and the market re-rates the asset on realized adoption rather than legal relief. Related Reading: XRP’s ‘Golden Ticket’ Might Not Be What You Think, Expert Says The firm’s view is that clarity expands the addressable buyer base and product surface area in the US “US-based institutions. Regulated funds and ETP issuers. Banks and payment companies.” In 21Shares’ telling, those channels were previously constrained by compliance risk, and their re-entry sets up a new phase of price discovery. The second pillar is flows. 21Shares says US spot XRP ETFs have “fundamentally rewritten” XRP’s demand profile, reaching more than $1.3 billion in assets under management in their first month and logging a 55-day streak of consecutive inflows. The note leans heavily on a supply-demand argument, pairing ETF absorption with what it characterizes as unusually sticky retail positioning. “Exchange reserves are at a seven-year low of 1.7 billion XRP. Institutional ETF demand is colliding with a community that refuses to sell.” That collision, the firm argues, is the “primary engine” for a potentially non-linear repricing, while also warning that reflexivity cuts both ways if inflows slow. To ground the reflexivity case, 21Shares points to the first year of US Bitcoin spot ETFs as a template, citing nearly $38 billion in net inflows and a price move from roughly $40,000 to $100,000 inside 12 months. The distinction, in its view, is liquidity overhead: XRP launched its ETF era at a much smaller market cap than Bitcoin did at its debut, implying a larger marginal impact per dollar of net buying, provided those early capture rates persist through 2026. Related Reading: XRP Could Enter New Growth Phase After Clarity Act Decision — Here’s How The third pillar is utility, with 21Shares positioning XRPL as “financial plumbing” for tokenization and stablecoin settlement. The note highlights RLUSD’s growth to more than 37,000 holders and a market cap increase of over 1,800% from $72 million to $1.38 billion in under a year, alongside XRPL DeFi TVL expanding nearly 100x over two years to above $100 million. It also points to the Multi-Purpose Tokens standard as a mechanism for institutions to issue RWAs with embedded metadata and compliance rules. Still, 21Shares flags execution risk: progress is “evolutionary, not explosive,” and XRPL trails rivals on developer and user engagement, with competition for RWA flows cited from Canton, Solana, and other ecosystems. 21Shares’ modeled peak ranges for 2026 put a base case at $2.45 (50% probability), a bull case at $2.69 (30%), and a bear case at $1.60 (implied -16%), with key swing factors being sustained ETF inflows, meaningful tokenization volumes, and RLUSD maintaining institutional traction. At press time, XRP traded at $1.8792. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Worldcoin Jumps Over 30% As OpenAI Plans To Develop A Bot-Free Rival To X",
    "body": "OpenAI’s hint that it may build a social app focused on real humans sent one crypto token climbing fast this week. Traders moved quickly after reports surfaced that the new service would try to block bots by using biometric checks. Prices jumped, chatter rose, and a few questions followed close behind. Related Reading: Something Big Is Brewing In XRP DeFi—And 91 Million Tokens Tell The Story Markets React To Biometric Rumors According to Forbes and several market outlets, OpenAI is quietly exploring a “humans-only” social platform. Reports say the project is still small, run by a roughly 10-person team inside the company. The idea would be to verify real users with biometric tools — either existing phone systems like Face ID or iris scans similar to the ones used by Worldcoin’s Orb. Worldcoin’s token, WLD, surged sharply on the news, hitting gains as high as 33% during the initial trading spike. That move was partly speculative. Prices later pulled back, but trading volume stayed elevated and volatility increased. WLD climbed from $0.51 to $0.68 in the last 24 hours, data from Coingecko shows. How Proof Of Personhood Could Be Used Proof of personhood aims to tell a platform which accounts are run by actual people and which ones are automated. Reports note that using biometrics would make it harder for bots to create fake accounts, but that approach raises new hurdles. For example, devices and systems must be trusted to check identity without sharing private data. Worldcoin’s model pairs an iris scan with a cryptographic claim. That claim is meant to prove uniqueness while hiding the raw biometric image. The technical detail matters. How the checks are stored, who holds the keys, and whether users can opt out will shape public acceptance. The Identity Project News outlets first published the OpenAI report late last week. Markets reacted in real time. Social posts amplified the rumor, and media pieces linked the plan back to Worldcoin because Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, helped start the identity project. No formal announcement has been made by OpenAI or by Worldcoin. Everything on the table is based on reporting from unnamed sources. It should be clear that plans can change, and that early reports often overstate certainty. Related Reading: PayPal Survey: 4 In 10 US Merchants Now Accept Crypto Privacy And Policy Questions Loom Policy experts were quick to point out issues. Biometrics are sensitive data. Laws in different countries treat them in different ways. Reports have disclosed that regulators will likely ask how consent is gathered, how long data is kept, and whether people can use alternatives to biometric checks. Security is also a concern: if a verification system is breached, the consequences could be serious. Some civil rights groups already say that any mass biometric system deserves close scrutiny.
