    "title": "Saylor Reveals What Will Drive Bitcoin Price To New ATHs – It’s Not What You Think",
    "body": "Bitcoin price dynamics heading into the next market cycle are being reframed by Michael Saylor, who argues that the forces capable of pushing Bitcoin to new all-time highs have little to do with speculation, retail enthusiasm, or ETF-driven flows. Instead, Saylor’s outlook positions Bitcoin price appreciation as the outcome of a deeper structural transition that is unfolding quietly within the banking system. Michael Saylor On Bitcoin Price’s Structural Shift As the market looks toward 2026, Michael Saylor’s thesis on Bitcoin price action focuses on a structural shift away from trader-driven dynamics toward regulated financial institutions, a transition that could fundamentally reshape how capital engages with Bitcoin at scale. For most of its history, Bitcoin price discovery has been dominated by cyclical trading behavior, leverage, and sentiment-driven momentum. Related Reading: Why The Current XRP Valuation Doesn’t Make Sense Even milestones such as spot Bitcoin ETFs, while broadening access, largely remain confined to traditional capital markets. Saylor’s view departs from this model by highlighting Bitcoin’s gradual integration into bank balance sheets, where valuation is driven by utility, collateralization, and long-term capital allocation rather than short-term market cycles. Recent developments underscore this shift. A growing number of major US banks have begun offering Bitcoin-collateralized loans, a move that signals a reclassification of Bitcoin from a high-volatility trading asset to a recognized form of financial collateral. Lending against Bitcoin reflects institutional confidence in its liquidity, custody standards, and long-term value stability. In practical terms, this positions Bitcoin alongside assets that are suitable for credit creation rather than short-term speculation. Once Bitcoin is integrated into lending structures, treasury operations, and institutional risk models, demand characteristics change materially. Capital deployed through these channels is not reactive to short-term price fluctuations. It is strategic, compliance-driven, and designed for multi-year horizons. This type of demand absorbs supply consistently, reinforcing scarcity dynamics already embedded in Bitcoin’s fixed issuance model. As a result, Bitcoin price appreciation becomes a function of sustained capital allocation rather than episodic market rallies. Banking Infrastructure And The New Ceiling For Bitcoin Price Saylor identifies 2026 as the period when the impact of banking adoption becomes fully visible. Major financial institutions such as Charles Schwab and Citigroup, planning to roll out Bitcoin custody and related services, point to a broader alignment between Bitcoin and regulated financial infrastructure. Related Reading: $130 Million XRP Fumble: Analyst Reveals What Went Wrong Custody plays a pivotal role in this process. When banks custody Bitcoin, they unlock the ability to embed it across wealth management platforms, corporate treasury strategies, and secured lending products. This dramatically expands Bitcoin’s addressable capital base by enabling participation from institutions previously constrained by regulatory, operational, or fiduciary limitations. As banking participation deepens, Bitcoin price behavior is likely to evolve. Volatility driven by leveraged trading and speculative positioning diminishes in relative importance, while long-term balance-sheet accumulation becomes a dominant force. In this environment, according to Saylor, Bitcoin’s new all-time highs will not be the product of sudden euphoria but the result of sustained absorption by institutions operating at scale.

    "title": "Bitcoin Funds See Significant Net Outflows Heading Into Year-End – What’s Going On?",
    "body": "The high tide of liquidity that has recently supported Bitcoin prices appears to be receding rapidly. The market is now grappling with significant net outflows, as data confirms that investment flows have turned decisively negative. This shift represents a stark turnaround in market dynamics, where selling pressure is currently overwhelming buying interest across major platforms. Why Markets Move Before Narratives Catch Up In an X post, a trader and investor in stocks and crypto, WealthManager, revealed that since December 8th, Bitcoin has recorded approximately $716 million in net outflows. Over the past two weeks, flows have been dominated almost entirely by outflows, reflecting a market that has lost momentum rather than conviction. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Crash Incoming? Twenty One Capital Moves 43,500 BTC Amid Major Losses Currently, the cryptocurrency market is not the preferred destination for momentum-driven capital. That momentum has rotated into gold, silver, and broader metals, but the rotations are temporary by nature. However, the opportunity remains in crypto, and the momentum will shift back into the sector at some point. “The lower BTC goes, the bigger the opportunity would become,” WealthManager noted. Analyst Cipher2X has offered an insight into why he is accumulating Bitcoin ahead of 2026. According to Cipher2X, BTC has never waited for perfect conditions to do its most important work. It builds its foundations when liquidity is tight and expectations are low. At this stage, price action is misleading, but the structure is not. On-chain data has shown that supply is increasingly locked up with long-term holders, while access to BTC through regulated channels is becoming routine rather than exceptional. At the same time, micro uncertainty continues to reinforce BTC’s role as a hedge against policy risk, not as a speculative bet on growth. This setup is the kind of environment where BTC intends to move sideways, frustrate the traders, and quietly shift ownership from impatient hands to committed ones. Cipher2X explains that the purpose of accumulating BTC isn’t a short-term catalyst, but because the next regime tends to reward those who have positioned early, not those who have reacted late. 2026 isn’t about the hype; it’s about who was already holding the asset. What Falling Volatility Says About Bitcoin’s Maturity The Bitcoin chart has shown the implied volatility on the BTC options over the past few years. A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, pointed out that aside from a few short spikes of volatility, there’s a clear trend down on this part. BTC is maturing as its market cap is growing over time, and the market is becoming more institutionalized. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Long Game Is Winning, Even If The Short Term Looks Messy—CEO Daan concluded that the days of seeing multiple 10%+ candles in a row are behind us.

    "body": "On-chain data shows a chunk of the Bitcoin supply has its cost basis above the current spot price, which could potentially shape volatility if BTC rebounds. Bitcoin Supply Overhang Could Dictate Volatility & Selling Pressure As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, over 6.6 million BTC is being held above the latest spot price of the cryptocurrency. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Supply In Loss,” which measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of Bitcoin that’s currently carrying some net unrealized loss. Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Fear Streak Extends To 13 Days On Christmas The metric works by going through the transaction history of each token in circulation to determine the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. If this previous transfer price was more than the current spot price for any coin, then that particular token is considered to be in a state of loss. The Supply In Loss adds up all coins fulfilling this condition to find the total situation on the network. A counterpart indicator called the Supply In Profit accounts for the supply of the opposite type. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Supply In Loss over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Supply In Loss shrunk to a value of zero as the asset’s price set its all-time high (ATH) above $126,000 back in October, but with the market downturn that has followed since then, the indicator’s value has shot up. Today, around 6.6 million tokens of the cryptocurrency sit below cost basis, equivalent to a third of the BTC supply in circulation. The recent highs in the Supply In Loss represent the highest degree of pain in the market since 2023. In another X post, the analyst has shared the chart for another Bitcoin indicator, this one called the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). The URPD contains information about how much BTC was bought last at each of the levels that the asset has visited in its history. Looks like a significant portion of the supply sits above the spot price | Source: @JA_Maartun on X From the chart of the URPD, it’s visible how the Bitcoin supply that’s in loss is distributed across the various levels right now. A few levels are particularly prominent in the degree of supply that they carry, while some others are notably thin with coins. Generally, investors who are in loss look forward to a retest of their cost basis so that they can get their money “back.” Once this happens, some of these hands decide to exit, fearing that BTC will go down again in the near future. This selling can make large supply clusters above the spot price, potential points of volatility.

    "title": "Gemini Poll Finds Over 70% Of Investors Predict XRP Below $2 By Year’s End",
    "body": "As the year draws to a close, XRP investors are increasingly adopting a bearish outlook, anticipating that the altcoin will remain below the critical $2 threshold. XRP Forecasts Dipped A recent poll conducted by cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, running from December 12 to 23, reveals that 73% of investors predict XRP will finish the year between $1.50 and $2.00, suggesting a muted conclusion for the altcoin’s performance in 2025. Just weeks prior, market sentiment was more optimistic, with around 38% of traders expecting XRP to rally to a range of $2.00 to $2.50 by December 31. However, that figure has since dropped to 28%, reflecting a significant decline in confidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correction Timeline: Analyst Predicts Potential Bottom In October 2026 The possibility of the cryptocurrency exceeding $2.50 appears almost non-existent, as only about 4% of respondents foresee it reaching the $2.50 to $3.00 range, and a similar 4% predict it could surpass $3.00. The consensus of 73% predicting an XRP finish between $1.50 and $2.00 marks an increase from the 63% recorded earlier in the poll. This growing alignment among poll participants indicates that they are consolidating around this range as the most likely scenario. Furthermore, the sentiment towards higher price levels has significantly shifted. The percentage of voters anticipating a rally into the mid-$2 range has dwindled to a mere 4%, reflecting dwindling confidence after several failed attempts to break through resistance levels. Even the outlook for the altcoin’s price to drop below $1.50 has risen slightly to 7%, up from 6%, although most believe a sharp sell-off is unlikely. Rising Supply From Early Investors This prevailing sentiment aligns with Futures data indicating a prevalence of aggressive sell orders, while the slow accumulation of XRP in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at a pace of $30 to $50 million daily cannot keep up with profit-taking and risk reduction activities in the market. On-chain data reveals that significant realized gains have been secured as XRP approached its recent highs. For instance, a long-term holder who initially acquired the altcoin around $0.40 sold over 350 million tokens at approximately $2.00, reaping an estimated profit of $721 million. Related Reading: Ethereum Fails To Surpass $3,000: Predictions For The Final Days Of The Year With many early investors reportedly cashing out at the $2 level, there has been minimal support for dip-buying to bolster the price, keeping it in the current range between $1.7 and $1.8 recorded in the week. Experts suggest that when the supply increases from long-term holders, whose initial investments were made at $0.40 to $0.60, it creates a resistance ceiling that is challenging to break without substantial new demand entering the market. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $1.830. The altcoin has recorded major losses in all time frames, with a year-to-date decline of 15%, in line with the broader market’s performance.

    "title": "Trust Wallet Exploit Drains $7M: Hundreds Of Users Affected",
    "body": "Amid already fragile sentiment across the crypto market, attackers exploited Trust Wallet, shaking confidence in self-custody solutions. The breach has impacted hundreds of users, with on-chain data showing that more than $6.77 million has already been stolen. The timing has amplified concern, coming at a moment when investors are already navigating heightened uncertainty, declining prices, and rising risk aversion. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Reserves On Binance Fall To Six-Month Low: Selling Pressure Is Easing According to the Trust Wallet team, the exploit appears to be linked to a recent update to its Chrome browser extension. In a public statement posted on X, the company urged users to take immediate action, stating: “Users with Browser Extension 2.68 should disable and upgrade to 2.69.” The message suggests that the vulnerability was isolated to a specific version of the extension, rather than the core wallet infrastructure, but the scale of the losses has nonetheless raised alarm. Trust Wallet is one of the most widely used self-custody wallets in the industry. Reporting a user base of roughly 220 million people globally. That reach makes any security incident particularly significant, not only because of the direct financial impact, but also due to the broader implications for trust in non-custodial platforms. As investigations continue and affected users assess the damage, the exploit adds another layer of stress to a market already grappling with weak sentiment and elevated skepticism toward crypto infrastructure. Funds Tracked As Trust Wallet Commits To Full Reimbursement On-chain investigators have begun tracing the movement of funds linked to the Trust Wallet exploit. According to analysis shared by Lookonchain, the attacker has already transferred approximately $5.5 million through a combination of instant swap services and centralized exchanges, including ChangeNOW, FixedFloat, KuCoin, and HTX. Routing funds through multiple channels suggests an attempt to obscure flows and accelerate laundering. A pattern commonly observed in recent wallet exploits. Despite the ongoing movement of stolen assets, Trust Wallet has moved quickly to reassure users. Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) publicly stated that Trust Wallet will fully cover all user losses resulting from the incident. This commitment has been central to calming concerns. Particularly given the wallet’s large global user base and the broader climate of weakened trust in crypto infrastructure. The Trust Wallet team later reinforced this position with a formal statement, confirming the scale of the impact and outlining next steps. “We’ve confirmed that approximately $7M has been impacted and we will ensure all affected users are refunded,” the team said. The team added that supporting affected users is the top priority, and they are actively finalizing the refund process. The statement also warned users to avoid interacting with messages that do not originate from official Trust Wallet channels. As fund tracking continues, the focus has now shifted from damage assessment to execution of reimbursements and restoration of user confidence. Altcoin Market Holds Key Support As Broader Structure Weakens The total cryptocurrency market capitalization excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum is trading near the $825 billion level on the weekly chart. Following a sharp pullback from the $1.1–$1.2 trillion highs reached earlier this year. This index, used as a proxy for broader altcoin market health, shows a clear loss of momentum after an aggressive expansion phase. Signaling rising stress across the altcoin sector. Technically, the market has slipped below its faster weekly moving average, which previously acted as dynamic support during the uptrend. That level has now flipped into resistance, limiting upside attempts. Price is currently hovering just above the longer-term moving averages, which converge between roughly $780 billion and $820 billion. This zone represents a critical structural support area. A sustained break below it would likely confirm a broader bearish transition for altcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Inflows Collapse While Binance Retains Relative Activity – Details From a market-structure perspective, holding the current range keeps the possibility of consolidation alive. However, failure to defend this support would open the door to a deeper retracement toward the $650–$700 billion region. For a bullish case to re-emerge, the altcoin market would need to reclaim the $900 billion level and reestablish acceptance above its key moving averages.

    "title": "RWA Tops Crypto Narratives In 2025: CoinGecko Reports 185% Growth",
    "body": "In a recent report, the data aggregator CoinGecko has unveiled the leading crypto narratives of the year, with the Real-World Asset (RWA) sector emerging as a major contender with notable returns RWAs Lead Crypto Market Growth The report highlights that RWA has become the standout narrative in 2025, boasting an impressive average price return of 185.8% year-to-date (YTD) across key tokens, such as Figure Heloc, Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Tether Gold (XAUT), and BlackRock’s BUIDL. This surge in the RWA sector can largely be attributed to the performance of specific platforms. Notably, Keeta Network has skyrocketed by 1,794.9% YTD, while Zebec Network and Maple Finance have recorded gains of 217.3% and 123.0% respectively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correction Timeline: Analyst Predicts Potential Bottom In October 2026 Current statistics show that the crypto RWA sector boasts a Distributed Asset Value of $18.88 billion, reflecting a 2.56% increase over the past month. However, the Represented Asset Value has seen a slight decline, standing at $407.93 billion, down 2.36%. For context, RWA’s approach facilitates asset managers and projects the digital transformation of tangible assets, such as real estate and commodities, creating a solid foundation for trading, managing, and securing these assets. Layer-1 (L1) solutions have emerged as the second most profitable narrative this year, achieving an average price gain of 80.3% YTD. The success of this narrative can be attributed to the performance of privacy-focused blockchains such as Zcash and Monero, which have seen rallies of 691.3% and 143.6%, respectively. Another noteworthy crypto narrative, “Made in USA,” is also on track to end the year positively, with average gains of 30.6% YTD, primarily driven by Zcash’s performance that mitigated the moderate losses of other tokens in that category. Top Meme Tokens Suffer Heavy Losses Despite their popularity, narratives such as memecoins and artificial intelligence (AI) have struggled this year, with average returns of -31.6% and -50.2% year-to-date, respectively. Leading memecoins in the crypto space, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), have demonstrated the volatility of this sector by suffering significant losses of over 60% year-to-date. Similarly, the report notes that many artificial intelligence-focused crypto assets have recorded declines between 49.8% and 84.3%, with only Alchemist AI and Kite performing relatively better. Related Reading: Ethereum Fails To Surpass $3,000: Predictions For The Final Days Of The Year Lastly, the decentralized finance narrative faced a challenging year, experiencing average returns of -34.8%, which is consistent with the returns seen in the memecoins segment. The decentralized exchange (DEX) narrative has mirrored this decline with average losses of -55.5%, while layer-2 (L2) solutions have also struggled, recording average returns of -40.6% for the second year in a row. At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto, Bitcoin (BTC), was trading at $88,960, having recorded losses of 10% year-to-date. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "As the first crypto ETFs targeting Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) near their second anniversary in the US, Galaxy Digital has made optimistic predictions regarding future inflows, projecting that they will outpace 2025 figures. Institutional Adoption Expected To Skyrocket In its 2026 forecast report, which concentrates on 26 critical areas, the firm anticipates that net inflows into US spot crypto ETFs will exceed $50 billion. This comes on the heels of a successful 2025, which saw net inflows reach $23 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correction Timeline: Analyst Predicts Potential Bottom In October 2026 Galaxy Digital believes that as institutional adoption continues to grow, these figures will accelerate in 2026. Wirehouses lifting restrictions on advisor recommendations and Vanguard introducing crypto funds, are expected to facilitate this. BTC and ETH exchange-traded funds alone are forecasted to surpass their 2025 inflow levels. In addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, Galaxy Digital reports an anticipated wave of new crypto ETFs, particularly in the spot altcoin products. Galaxy Digital Forecasts Over 100 New Crypto ETFs The firm estimates that over 50 spot altcoin exchange-traded funds, along with another 50 crypto ETFs that do not focus on single coins, will debut in the US. Following the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s recent approval of generic listing standards, the number of spot altcoin ETF launches is expected to gain momentum in 2026. In 2025, more than 15 spot crypto ETFs were launched for various altcoins, including Solana (SOL), XRP, Hedera (HBAR), Dogecoin (DOE), Litecoin (LTC), and Chainlink (LINK). Galaxy Digital anticipates that notable assets yet to file their spot ETFs will soon follow suit, and in addition to single-asset products, the market is also likely to see the introduction of multi-asset ETFs and leveraged crypto ETFs. Over 290 Crypto Companies Ready For US IPO Beyond Crypto ETFs, Galaxy Digital also predicts that more than 15 cryptocurrency companies will pursue initial public offerings (IPOs) or uplist in the US. Over the past year, 10 crypto-related firms, including Galaxy itself, successfully went public or uplisted. Related Reading: Ethereum Fails To Surpass $3,000: Predictions For The Final Days Of The Year The firm notes that more than 290 crypto and blockchain companies have completed significant private funding rounds since 2018, positioning them to seek US listings as regulatory conditions improve. Among the companies believed to be potential candidates for initial public offerings or uplisting in 2026 are CoinShares, BitGo (which has already filed), Chainalysis, and FalconX. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $87,480, which is a 30% retracement from the all-time highs reached in October, and a 3% drop over the past month.

    "title": "Dogecoin Triangle Formation Breakdown Spells Trouble As 15% Move Nears – Time To Be Cautious?",
    "body": "After the latest market pullback, Dogecoin is attempting to hold a crucial support area to open the door for a recovery rally. However, some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency’s bleeding may not be over and a move to lower levels looms. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For ‘Boring’ 2025 Close – Here’s When BTC’s Real Test Will Come Dogecoin Chart Signals Short-Term Caution On Friday, Dogecoin saw another 4.2% intraday decline to from the $0.126 area amid the ongoing market volatility. The cryptocurrency has retraced over 50% from the early October highs, losing multiple key support zones in the past two months. After losing the $0.135 level nearly two weeks ago, DOGE has been the $0.120-$0.135 price range, failing to break past the range’s high despite various attempts. Now, the largest memecoin by market capitalization is attempting to hold the crucial $0.120 support zone to prevent further bleeding. Therefore, some market observers have advised caution during the last week of the year. In an X post, analyst More Crypto Online affirmed that Dogecoin “is still a falling knife” as it appears that its corrective move is not done yet. “There’s no evidence that wave B has bottomed,” he explained, which suggests that a 20% drop toward the next key supports, the $0.096 and $0.08 levels, could be likely. Per the post, “Caution is recommended until the price shows a first micro 5-wave move to the upside.” Similarly, analyst Crypto Jobs warned that investors should stay cautious as Dogecoin does not display a bullish reversal structure and has weak buying volume, unlike multiple other altcoins. He explained that momentum is bearish despite holding the key $0.12 level, adding that, as long as DOGE’s price stays under the $0.14-$0.15 area, bulls won’t be in control and the bearish set up and downtrend structure will remain intact. No buy pressure at the moment, without volume. No bull structure… Under the main downtrend & channel, seeing another dump toward the $0.100 – $0.09500 lower support looks realistic. Sideway phase ongoing on the short term [H4 outlook]. We may also see some bullish move before a possible next wave downward. DOGE’s Price Breakdown Imminent? Market watcher BitGuru considers that DOGE’s deep correction is completed. He pointed out that the cryptocurrency is currently sitting in a major demand zone, between the $0.120-$0.130 levels, where liquidity has already been swept. Based on this, he forecasted that a reclaim of the late November levels could set the stage for a recovery rally toward the $0.18 resistance. On the contrary, failing to hold the current levels would hint that Dogecoin will continue in a prolonged consolidation phase. Meanwhile, Trader Tardigrade highlighted that the cryptocurrency’s price has reached the target of its previous symmetrical triangle pattern after breaking down from the formation earlier this month. Related Reading: More Pain For Ethereum? Head And Shoulder Pattern Signals $2,400 Breakdown Now, Dogecoin is forming a new pattern and “searching for a new trend,” he added. According to the trader, DOGE has been forming another symmetrical triangle pattern on the H4 chart over the past two weeks, which could resolve in a 15% move toward a bearish or bullish trend. Notably, Friday’s pullback sent the cryptocurrency below the pattern’s lower boundary, which sits around the $0.123 mark, signaling that a drop toward the $0.10-$0.11 area is possible if price doesn’t bounce soon. As of this writing, Dogecoin trades at $0.122, a 7.3% decline in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",
