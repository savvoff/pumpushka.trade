    "title": "Bitcoin Bulls Take Control: Futures Positioning Turns Bullish for First Time Since October",
    "body": "Bitcoin is pushing above the $95,000 level as selling pressure across the market continues to ease, offering a renewed sense of short-term stability after weeks of choppy consolidation. Following a volatile end to last year, price action has gradually improved, with buyers regaining control and forcing Bitcoin back into a range that had previously acted as resistance. While skepticism remains high and many analysts continue to warn of a broader corrective phase, recent derivatives and positioning data suggest that market behavior may be shifting beneath the surface. Related Reading: Bitcoin LTH SOPR Signals Early Capitulation, But Selling Pressure Remains Contained According to an analysis shared by Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s Positioning Index SMA-30d has climbed to 3.5, marking the first sustained breakout above the 3.0 level since October 6, 2025. That previous breakout occurred during the rally that ultimately carried BTC toward the $125,000 peak, making the current move particularly notable from a historical perspective. The positioning index reflects aggregated futures market dynamics, including open interest, funding behavior, and long-short activity, and is often used to identify regime changes in trader sentiment. This renewed strength in positioning does not guarantee immediate upside continuation, but it does indicate that futures traders are once again willing to take directional exposure after months of defensive positioning. As Bitcoin holds above $95K, the coming sessions will be critical in determining whether this move develops into a broader trend or remains a temporary relief rally. Futures Positioning Signals a Shift Toward a Bullish Regime According to Axel Adler Jr., the recent breakout of the Positioning Index SMA-30d above the 3.0 level marks an important local shift in Bitcoin’s futures market structure. After spending nearly three months oscillating within the 0 ± 2 range, this move signals that traders are transitioning from neutral or defensive positioning into a more directional stance. Adler notes that confirmation now depends on persistence rather than speed. The key continuation trigger is the SMA holding above the 2.0 level for at least one week, which would validate that the shift is not a short-lived reaction. This view is reinforced by developments in the Bitcoin Advanced Sentiment Index. While sentiment briefly peaked at 93.15% when BTC traded near $95,061, it has since cooled to roughly 70%. Importantly, this pullback has occurred without a breakdown in price structure. The index remains well above the neutral 50% threshold and above its 30-day average near 62.9%, indicating that bullish conditions still dominate the futures market. Adler interprets the roughly 23-percentage-point decline in sentiment as a healthy release of short-term overheating rather than a trend reversal. Historically, such resets often strengthen trend durability. Risk emerges if sentiment falls below 50% alongside a price drop under $92,000. Conversely, holding sentiment above 60% during short consolidation phases would support further upside continuation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Near A Profit Flip: A Key Level Comes Into Focus Bitcoin Price Action Details Bitcoin price action on the daily chart shows a clear attempt to regain control after a prolonged consolidation phase. Following the sharp November sell-off that pushed BTC into the low $80K region, price has gradually formed a higher-low structure, signaling stabilization rather than continued capitulation. The recent push above $95,000 marks the highest daily close since mid-November and places Bitcoin back above its short-term moving average, a level that had capped upside throughout December. However, the broader trend remains mixed. The 50-day moving average is still sloping downward and sits above the current price, acting as near-term dynamic resistance. Meanwhile, the 200-day moving average continues to trend higher well below price, confirming that the broader market structure remains intact despite recent volatility. This positioning reflects a market transitioning from corrective pressure into a potential recovery phase, rather than a clean trend reversal. Related Reading: XRP Consolidates Above $2 As Volume Z-Score Signals A Quiet Market The recent advance toward $95K occurred without a significant volume spike, suggesting reduced selling pressure rather than aggressive new demand. This is consistent with a relief-driven move fueled by short covering and position rebalancing. For bulls, holding above the $93K–$95K range is critical to maintain momentum and build a base for continuation. Failure to consolidate above this zone would increase the risk of renewed range-bound trading or a pullback toward the $90K support area. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Ethereum Could Surge To $7,500 And Leave Bitcoin Behind, Banking Giant Says",
    "body": "Standard Chartered has pushed its base-case price target for Ethereum to $7,500 by the end of the year, a big jump from an earlier $4,000 projection. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New Power Buyers: Companies Bought 3 Times What Miners Produced According to the bank’s digital assets team, growing demand from corporate treasury buyers and spot ETH products has driven the change in outlook. Bank Raises Ethereum Target The bank’s lead analyst expects fee growth on the Ethereum network and stronger institutional adoption to be key drivers for the move higher. The bank also revised its longer-term numbers, lifting its 2028 target to $25,000 and laying out scenarios that push toward $40,000 by 2030. These wider targets reflect models where stablecoins and tokenized assets expand on Ethereum’s chain. Institutional Buying Drives Demand Data cited by market researchers points to heavy accumulation since June, with spot ETF flows and treasury firms together taking close to 4% of Ether’s circulating supply over that period. ETHEREUM SEEN OUTPERFORMING BITCOIN Standard Chartered says Ethereum’s outlook has improved and it is likely to outperform bitcoin. While weak bitcoin performance has weighed on the broader crypto market, rising institutional demand for ethereum and its dominance in stablecoins,… — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 13, 2026 Treasury firms alone reportedly bought about 2.3 million ETH in just over two months, a pace that Standard Chartered says outstrips some previous accumulation phases seen in Bitcoin. Ethereum Vs. Bitcoin Standard Chartered’s note also argues that Ether could outperform Bitcoin, raising the possibility of the ETH/BTC ratio returning toward levels last seen during 2021’s run-up. Based on the bank’s scenarios, weaker Bitcoin momentum combined with stronger real-world use of Ethereum might lift Ether’s price faster than Bitcoin’s in the months ahead. Long-Term Upside Scenarios Some headlines have pointed to even bigger long-range targets produced by the same models, including forecasts of $30,000 by 2029 and $40,000 by 2030 under more bullish assumptions. These outcomes rely on a substantial expansion of stablecoin use, tokenized real-world assets, and continued staking demand that would remove supply from the market. Independent forecasters remain split, and other banks have offered lower year-end projections, offering a reminder that expert views differ. Meanwhile, market watchers caution, though, that relative moves depend heavily on ETF flows and corporate balance-sheet decisions.

That said, the bank notes that scale improvements and Layer 1 throughput will matter a lot if big, traditional finance transactions migrate onchain. The research also warns that shifts in macro conditions, outflows from major ETFs, or regulatory setbacks could change the math quickly. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Crypto Market Bill Draft Criticized For Allowing Continued Developer Prosecution",
    "body": "The recently released draft of the CLARITY Act, a significant piece of legislation aimed at regulating the crypto market, has ignited a wave of criticism from supporters within the community. Initially, the bill was meant to include protections for developers. However, expert commentary suggests that it opens the door to continued prosecution of developers and enhances surveillance measures for users of non-custodial software. Crypto Market Structure Bill Draft Lacks Essential Protections Market expert Ryan Adams highlighted another key issue in the crypto bill, stating that if banks succeed in eliminating stablecoin yield provisions within the CLARITY Act, it would indicate that the Senate is prioritizing bank interests over those of the general public. Adams’s concerns were echoed by various users, who opined that the strategy appears orchestrated to allow banks to benefit by controlling how yields are managed and distributed. Related Reading: Zcash Foundation Investigation Closed: SEC Decision Sparks 12% Jump In ZEC Price An independent report by The Rage reinforces these worries, detailing how the proposed draft includes so-called developer protections that may fall short. Notably absent are safeguards against the rigorous implications of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) for self-custodial wallets. Additionally, the draft hints at possible applications to decentralized finance (DeFi) that could empower agencies to implement Travel Rule-like regulations, along with anti-money laundering (AML) measures targeting web-based interfaces and blockchain analysis firms. Per the report, the Senate has already received 137 amendments to the draft ahead of its markup, scheduled for January 15. A revised version of the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA) is also included, which has been seen as vital for protecting developers. BRCA Loopholes While the BRCA offers exemptions under AML and counter-terrorist financing regulations, it continues to leave developers vulnerable to accountability for the actions of users utilizing their software. The BRCA states that “non-controlling” developers—defined as those without unilateral control over digital asset transactions—will not be categorized as money transmitters under the relevant laws. However, this only alleviates certain charges and doesn’t prevent criminal liability for those whose software is misused. Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis remarked on this aspect of the BRCA, indicating that it retains all necessary AML protections, which implies that despite any positives, accountability remains a looming threat for developers. Simultaneously, the “Keep Your Coins Act” within the draft includes provisions claiming that federal agencies cannot prohibit self-custody of digital assets. However, further stipulations assert that this right does not prevent the application of laws concerning illicit finance, leaving loopholes for government intervention. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) past attempts to impose a broker rule that would classify decentralized finance services as intermediaries requiring reporting obligations have been echoed in the current draft. This time, the Senate Banking Committee appears to be leaning towards a similar regulatory approach, aiming to provide guidance on BSA and AML compliance for “non-decentralized finance protocols,” thereby raising concerns about the implications for crypto developers who maintain and update protocols. Privacy Concerns Mount Under the new sections, the Senate Banking Committee introduces a concept termed “Distributed Ledger Application Layers,” which the report claims invites scrutiny and creates compliance obligations for software applications that allow users to interact with decentralized finance protocols. The provisions also compel the Treasury to develop additional oversight mechanisms to mitigate exposure to illicit financing risks identified through distributed ledger analysis tools, effectively ensuring that crypto transactions remain under close scrutiny. Related Reading: The NYC Token Crash: Allegations Of Rug Pull After $2.5 Million Liquidity Withdrawal As it currently stands, the lack of robust protections for developers and users involved in privacy-enhancing technologies in this current draft suggests that the Senate’s proposal for market structure will do little to safeguard non-custodial developers. Instead, it further entrenches their vulnerability to government oversight and user surveillance. Ultimately, these developments present a significant challenge for privacy software users and developers. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Analyst Says It’s Time For Ethereum’s ‘Big Test’ – Is ETH Season Loading?",
    "body": "After its recent price breakout, Ethereum (ETH) is facing its next big test and attempting to turn a crucial area into support. Some analysts have suggested that the altcoin is ready to continue its bullish momentum, arguing that the biggest rotation in years is coming. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears ‘Historic’ Technical Test As Price Eyes $93,500 Barrier – What’s Next? Ethereum Challenges Key Resistance Area On Wednesday, Ethereum broke past a crucial area and retested the $3,400 level for the first time in over a month. The king of altcoins has seen a 6% increase in the daily timeframe, jumping from the $3,100 level to the current levels. Notably, ETH has been hovering between the $3,000-$3,300 area since the start of the year rally, but failed to break the local range’s upper boundary during last week’s attempt. Now, the cryptocurrency has daily closed above this barrier and is testing this area as support. Amid this performance, analyst Michaël van de Poppe affirmed that “it’s ETH season” as the leading altcoin has held above the 21-day Moving Average (MA) since January 1. He explained that this level, officially lost during the early Q4 2025 corrections, is crucial for the price to hold onto to strengthen the momentum. To the market observer, Ethereum is “ready to make new highs and continue the uptrend,” and based on this structure, his main scenario is that the cryptocurrency will likely retest the $3,800 area soon. Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that ETH is currently facing a “big test.” The trader noted that the altcoin has been moving within its $2,600-$3,300 price range over the past two months, adding that a breakout from this range is necessary to define the direction of its next move. Per the chart, Ethereum must reclaim the $3,350 level, where the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) is located. This indicator has served as a key rejection area since November, and breaking above it “should lead to a move higher to catch the Daily 200MA next,” currently located around the $3,600 area. ETH To Follow Its 2018 Playbook? Crypto Jelle also shared an optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency, asserting that Ethereum “looks better than it has looked in years” against both Bitcoin (BTC) and the US Dollar. He argued that both charts are poised to move higher since ETH’s downtrend against BTC is over, and its USD chart looks ready to push towards the $4,000 barrier again. He added that the ETH/BTC anticipated rally means “ETHUSD could see price move a lot higher over the coming months.” Similarly, Alex Wacy recently explained that the “biggest ETH rotation in 8 years [is] forming right now.” The analyst highlighted that the king of altcoins is repeating the same playbook that led to its 2018 breakout against BTC, but with “bigger players” and “more capital entering.” Related Reading: Monero (XMR) Hits New $610 All-Time High – Veteran Trader Shares Silver-Like Setup According to the chart, ETH saw a multi-year accumulation against Bitcoin between 2015 and 2017, leading to its massive expansion in 2018. After an initial breakout, the cryptocurrency re-accumulated for an extended period inside a falling wedge pattern, which resulted in a 50x pump from this structure. This time, Ethereum’s trading pair against BTC moved within a multi-year falling wedge pattern again, which was broken out of in Q4 2025. If history repeats itself, the altcoin could see a new massive surge against the flagship crypto over the coming months. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,375, a 5% increase in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Price Is Approaching A Key Decision Zone, But Structure Is Still Firmly Bullish",
    "body": "Market analyst Egrag Crypto said the XRP price structure remains largely bullish despite the cryptocurrency’s recent struggles to break above $2. The analyst has presented a chart analysis showing XRP slowly approaching a key decision zone that could determine its next upward move and push it firmly out of its current consolidation. XRP Price Structure Still Bullish On Wednesday, January 14, Egrag Crypto said the XRP 3-day chart shows obvious, strong signals. He stated that XRP remains structurally bullish despite experiencing long periods of consolidation following its last rebound above $2 this year. According to the analyst, XRP’s price is currently compressing within a descending channel as it moves closer to a key decision zone between $2.30 and $2.40. He explained that this type of compression often appears after a strong move and can lead to a larger price expansion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $57,000: The Bullish Path That Could End In Tears In his post on X, Egrag Crypto shared key trends he observed on XRP’s 3-day chart. He revealed that the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has begun to flatten, indicating that selling pressure for XRP may be easing. At the same time, the 200 EMA continues to move higher, supporting the analyst’s opinion that the macro trend for XRP is still bullish. Egrag Crypto also emphasized that XRP is holding above the EMA cluster, a sign of structural strength rather than weakness. He highlighted that the upper boundary of the descending channel aligns precisely with the critical resistance areas at $2.3, marked by a red line on the chart. As these four developments occur simultaneously on the XRP chart, Egrag Crypto shared insights into their potential price impacts. He stated that a clean 3-day close above $2.40 would likely confirm XRP’s breakout from the descending channel. Based on the chart structure, he added that such a move could open the door for a continuation toward the $2.70 and $3.13 levels. If XRP is rejected at the channel’s resistance, Egrag Crypto has said that the price would likely remain range-bound. He concluded his analysis by emphasizing that as long as XRP continues trading above $2.0, its bullish structure will remain intact, and this ongoing consolidation phase should be seen as a period of compression ahead of a potential major price expansion. Related Reading: This Ethereum Triangle Breakout Puts Price Above $24,000, Here’s The Path Chart Signals Potentially Deeper Downtrend In Egrag Crypto’s chart, the lower boundary of the descending channel touches a key support area, marked by a white line. This could mean that if XRP fails to hold $2 and even drops below it, it could invalidate the analyst’s bullish thesis and trigger a decline toward the next support level at $1.65, representing a roughly 17.5% drop from current prices. If price falls further below $1.65, XRP could crash toward the last highlighted support level just around $1.0, reflecting an approximately 50% decrease from around $2.1.

    "body": "Russia is preparing a landmark legal transformation that would expand who are qualified to buy and own cryptocurrencies in the country. Reports have disclosed that lawmakers in the State Duma are in the final phase of text meant to lower barriers for ordinary Russians, even as they keep safeguards and restrictions in place. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New Power Buyers: Companies Bought 3 Times What Miners Produced The draft bill has drawn attention because it marks a shift from years of strict limits. According to TASS, the proposal would take cryptocurrencies out of a special financial regulation regime so they become a more common part of financial life for people across Russia. Lawmakers say this could make buying and holding crypto something regular citizens do, instead of a privilege for a few. “A bill has already been prepared that removes cryptocurrencies from special financial regulation, which means, they will be a common occurrence in our lives,” Anatoly Aksakov, chair of the State Duma’s Financial Market Committee, said. Expanded Access With Caps Under the current text, people who are not considered “qualified investors” would be able to buy digital coins up to a certain limit. The figure mentioned is 300,000 rubles per year, which is roughly $3,800. This cap aims to let more Russians participate in crypto while trying to prevent big losses if prices swing wildly. Ordinary buyers would still face conditions. Reports say they will have to meet some basic criteria or checks before gaining access, such as passing a short risk‑awareness step and trading only through licensed brokers or exchanges. This is meant to keep unregulated peer‑to‑peer trading from dominating. Professional or qualified market players would face fewer limits. They could trade and hold a wider range of cryptocurrencies with no annual restrictions, though they may still have to demonstrate understanding of risks. Legislative Push And Timing Lawmakers have said the draft is ready and will be discussed during Russia’s spring parliamentary session. If the State Duma passes the bill, implementation could start later in 2026. Aksakov told state media that this move could make crypto “a normal part of life” for many Russians. At the same time, Russian regulators continue to work on other crypto rules. The Bank of Russia has said it plans to set out penalties for illegal crypto intermediaries starting in 2027 and is pushing for a wider regulatory framework that covers both qualified and ordinary investors.

    "title": "Analyst Says XRP Price Just Entered Neutral State – What This Means",
    "body": "A crypto analyst has announced that the XRP price has just entered a neutral state and could be gearing up for a major rally. He explains how this phase has historically appeared before strong rallies and outlines what the current market structure may signal for XRP moving forward. XRP Price Enters Neutral State Before Bull Rally Crypto expert and data analyst CW recently shared a fresh update on XRP’s price action, noting that the cryptocurrency has broken out from its bottom and moved into a neutral state. He said this shift marks the early stage of a larger bull rally, with a decisive move above the previous all-time high acting as the key signal for price acceleration. Related Reading: XRP Analyst Says This Is What They Aren’t Showing You, ‘Don’t Get Shaken Out’ The chart he shared shows XRP following a repeated four-phase pattern across multiple market cycles, first from 2014 to 2018 and again from 2017 to date. In the 2014 cycle, Phase 1 began with a sharp breakout to TP1, setting a new ATH. From that peak, XRP entered Phase 2, which formed a Symmetrical Triangle. During this phase, XRP moved sideways within a tightening range for several months. Phase 3 came next, marking a long consolidation period for XRP. Eventually, XRP’s price broke the upper boundary of the symmetrical triangle and entered Phase 4. In this final phase, XRP surged to TP2, reaching a second ATH at the 6.618 Fibonacci extension level. According to the chart, XRP has already completed Phases 1-3 in the current cycle and has entered Phase 4. After hitting its first peak around $3.5 (TP1) earlier in 2025, the cryptocurrency recently broke above the upper boundary of a similar Symmetrical Triangle pattern, entering a “neutral state.” Now that XRP has reached this state, CW noted that it has entered Phase 4, the final stage of the four-phase historical pattern. The analyst has projected a second new all-time high for XRP near $21.5, aligning with the 6.618 Fibonacci extension level from the 2014 cycle. How Momentum Indicators Reacted During Each Phase At the bottom of CW’s price chart is a Stochastic Oscillator and a Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram. The stochastic shows overbought and oversold conditions for each cycle. Related Reading: Analyst Breaks Down Why Investors Will Make More Money With XRP Than Bitcoin In Phase 2 of each cycle, the stochastic frequently hits oversold levels, which align with the extended consolidation and price decline observed in that period. During Phase 3, it stays around the middle range, reflecting a neutral state. Finally, in Phase 4 of the 2014 cycle, it spikes toward overbought levels, coinciding with strong price breakouts. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram mirrors momentum shifts in each phase. During Phase 1, the histogram shows strong positive bars during the initial breakout. Phase 2 saw negative bars as the price declined, signaling bearish momentum. After this, Phase 3 showed small, fluctuating bars, indicating low momentum. Lastly, in Phase 4, the histogram rapidly expands on the breakout, pushing its price to new ATHs in 2014. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Rally Reflects Buyer Conviction On Coinbase Spot Markets, Bull Run Back On?",
    "body": "The recent Bitcoin rally may be driven by real spot demand on Coinbase. Data indicating elevated spot activity on Coinbase suggests that this move higher is bolstered by direct purchases rather than leveraged positioning in derivatives markets. This distinction matters because Spot buying reflects a real capital commitment, not a temporary bet. Why Risk Management When Demand Is Structural The Bitcoin rally since Sunday’s Powell subpoena news has been largely linked to Coinbase spot buyers. Crypto trader Alex Krüger has highlighted on X that both the Adjusted Coinbase Premium and Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) show steady spot accumulation, which is exactly why this has been a true hated rally even among bitcoiners. For over a month, the dominant narrative in every crypto chat room has been that BTC is lagging while equities and commodities are moving upward. Related Reading: Analyst Outlines The Bulllish And Bearish Scenarios For Bitcoin – Here’s What To Know However, the fun fact is that equities are not accurate, but 40% of the S&P 500 (Standard & Poor’s 500) stocks have actually closed red in 2025, (39.2% to be precise). Perception is doing a lot of work here, and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) move on Powell represented a major macro litmus test for BTC. Kruger claims that the BTC long-term value proposition is about protecting against the tail risk of central bank profligacy. On Monday, BTC surged upward, although the move was just a little surge. According to Krüger, the BTC key battlefield remains the 50-week moving average (WMA), which is currently around $101,420. Meanwhile, the trader is looking to take some profits into short liquidations right above the $100,000 mark. Why Bitcoin Benefits First From Institutional Flows The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act is set for markup today, January 15th, 2026, in the Senate Banking Committee. According to the update by BTC_road_to200k on X (Formally Twitter), this is where the lawmakers will debate and shape the final version of the bill before it moves forward. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Stays Pinned Above Support, Setting Up a Bigger Move This matters because the art aims to clear up the ongoing regulatory uncertainty between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which has been a major source of hesitation for large institutional players looking to move into Bitcoin and other digital assets. Furthermore, the Clarity Act will be a turning point as it aims to clear rules that will bring more confidence to banks, pension funds, and large investors, which often translates into higher demand and stronger price momentum for BTC. As the regulatory clouds lift, the market might start experiencing a renewed wave of institutional money flowing in, and that’s obviously bullish for BTC.

    "title": "XRP Will Skyrocket Beyond $18: Analyst Suggests 800% Growth Potential In 2026",
    "body": "Market expert Bird has recently issued a bold forecast for XRP, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, suggesting that it could experience a major upside of 800% within this year. If this prediction holds true, XRP could reach a new all-time high of $18.40 per coin. Forecast Indicates XRP Might Rival Ethereum Bird’s forecast hinges on the XRP/BTC ratio, which he predicts will reach 1:5,000 by the end of 2026. This means that 5,000 XRP would be equivalent to 1 Bitcoin (BTC). Currently, the XRP/BTC ratio trades at approximately 0.00002235. Related Reading: Crypto Market Bill Draft Criticized For Allowing Continued Developer Prosecution For Bird’s envisioned target to materialize, the ratio must increase to 0.0002 BTC per token, representing a substantial gain of around 794% from current levels. With a total supply of 100 billion coins, this price projection implies an overall valuation of approximately $1.84 trillion for XRP. Such a figure would place the cryptocurrency in close competition with Ethereum—and striking distance of Bitcoin’s market cap. Additional Price Scenarios For The Altcoin Market expert Sam Daodu also outlined alternative scenarios for XRP’s future performance. In a base case, where the altcoin garners continued institutional support but doesn’t close the gap with Bitcoin’s market capitalization, the price could range between $3 and $4. This outcome would depend on exchange traded funds (ETFs) attracting a “few billion in assets” while Bitcoin’s dominance falls to the 40–50% range during a broader altcoin rotation. Related Reading: Zcash Foundation Investigation Closed: SEC Decision Sparks 12% Jump In ZEC Price Conversely, there exists a bear case where macroeconomic challenges or obstacles within the crypto ecosystem could hinder XRP’s price growth. Factors such as geopolitical instability could redirect capital back to Bitcoin and gold, while banks might opt for private ledgers and established stablecoins instead of adopting XRP. Monthly escrow releases from Ripple of 1 billion coins, accompanied by a potential diminishing exchange-traded fund demand, might cap any potential upside action for the cryptocurrency, leaving it to trade around its current trading prices of $2.

    "title": "Ethereum Chart Turns Bullish: New Cycle Energy Points To $5,000",
    "body": "Ethereum is back to trading just above $3,300 per ETH in a slow bullish extension over the past week. After months of wide swings and failed follow-throughs above $3,000, the structure on the monthly timeframe chart is beginning to look bullish in a way that traders should take seriously. A recent technical breakdown shared by Merlijn The Trader on X shows that Ethereum is approaching a moment where consolidation could give way to forceful expansion, with $5,000 as the most important inflection point. Bullish Pennant Says Bullish Momentum About To Be Unlocked The chart showing the technical analysis from Merlijn shows a bullish pennant forming on Ethereum’s monthly timeframe. This bullish pennant shows that price action has been compressing between a rising support line and a descending resistance line, and this has created a narrowing structure since 2021. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Are Surging Today Ethereum briefly pushed above the upper boundary of this pennant in 2025, rallying to just under the $5,000 mark before momentum faded and corrective moves followed. Since then, price action appears to be gravitating back toward the former resistance line, now acting as a key area of interest. As it stands, Ethereum is now retesting the upper trendline of this bullish pennant for a final upward move. Based on this projection, the first major barrier for Ethereum to break is around $3,300. A clean break above that level would likely open a path toward $3,600, an area that previously acted as a turning point during past rallies. The most consequential zone, however, is around the August 2025 all-time high of $5,000. A break above this zone would unlock bullish momentum based on the bullish pennant and play out in the majority of 2026. How Can This Breakout Play Out? Merlijn’s chart doesn’t stop at the breakout trigger once it breaks above the upper trendline of the pennant. It sketches a full road map for how the move could unfold once Ethereum leaves the pennant. The first step in that projection is a push above $3,600 before a more meaningful test around $5,000. Once Ethereum is able to break above $5,000, then the door is open for new price highs. Related Reading: Why The Ethereum Price Could Bounce Above $3,500 Soon However, the breakout is expected to come with volatility and retests, not a straight line upward, but still resolves higher if the pennant thesis holds. From $5,000, the projection turns into a two-stage expansion. The first stage shows a force move, where Ethereum goes on a rally to as high as $6,000, then chops through another sharp dip to $4,000 and another recovery sequence before the larger leg higher. The larger leg, higher projected on the chart, points to $8,400 as the final price target zone for Ethereum. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Breaks Free From The Current Range — $107,000 Now The Level To Watch",
    "body": "Bitcoin is starting to emerge from its consolidation phase, suggesting that a decisive move may be underway. After holding above the former resistance, the market is starting to show early signs of confidence returning. The spotlight now shifts to the $107,000 level, where the strength of this breakout will be truly tested. Holds Firm Despite A Weak Start To The Session Bitcoin Meraklsi, in a recent BTC market update, outlined a largely positive outlook despite the day beginning with some downside pressure. While early trading showed red across the board, the analyst emphasized that the broader structure remains healthy, with Bitcoin still trading comfortably above the $96,000 region. Related Reading: BTC Breaks Higher as Record Bitcoin ETF Inflows Trigger Wave of Bearish Liquidations A major technical development highlighted in the update is Bitcoin’s breakout above the long-watched $94,800 resistance level, which previously capped upside moves, and is now acting as support. So far, price action suggests that buyers are stepping in on pullbacks, reinforcing the strength of this level and reducing the risk of an immediate reversal. As long as BTC continues to hold above $94,800, the bullish roadmap remains unchanged. The next clear upside target sits at $107,300, a level that could mark the next phase of expansion if momentum continues to build. The analyst also addressed why altcoins have yet to respond meaningfully to Bitcoin’s strength. In the view, the wider market is still waiting for confirmation and confidence from BTC itself. That confidence is more likely to emerge once Bitcoin reaches the $107,300 region. At that point, improved sentiment and risk appetite could spill over into altcoins, setting the stage for a stronger, more synchronized market move. Bitcoin Tests The Upper Boundary Of A Long-Standing Range According to Crypto Candy, Bitcoin appears to be transitioning out of a prolonged consolidation phase after spending considerable time moving sideways. At the time of the post, price was challenging the upper boundary of the $94,000–$96,000 range, signaling a potential shift in market momentum as buyers attempt to regain control. Related Reading: Wall Street Analyst Is Still Bullish On Bitcoin, Predicts Price Recovery BTC is now trading above it, but it must continue to hold above the range, which serves as a crucial validation zone. Sustained strength above this area would confirm bullish intent and increase the probability of a continued advance, with the $107,000 region standing out as the next major upside objective in the weeks ahead. However, the setup is not without risk. If Bitcoin fails to maintain its position above $94,000, the current move could quickly lose traction and be labeled a false breakout. Such a development invites renewed selling pressure, potentially dragging the price back toward lower support zones as the market reassesses direction.

    "body": "Zcash (ZEC) is back on investors’ radar after U.S. regulators ended a long-running investigation into the Zcash Foundation without enforcement. The decision removes a key source of uncertainty that had followed the privacy-focused cryptocurrency since 2023. Related Reading: XRP Price Is Approaching A Key Decision Zone, But Structure Is Still Firmly Bullish Markets reacted quickly, with ZEC posting double-digit gains in some sessions and stabilizing above the $400 level. While regulatory clarity has helped improve sentiment, questions around governance and long-term development remain. ZEC's price trends sideways after a violent move upwards on the daily chart. Source: ZECUSD on Tradingview SEC Closes Two-Year Zcash Investigation The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission confirmed it has concluded its review of the Zcash Foundation, which began with a subpoena issued on August 31, 2023. The inquiry focused on potential securities law concerns tied to Zcash’s funding model, governance structure, and token distribution. According to the foundation, the SEC does not intend to recommend enforcement action, fines, or operational changes. This outcome marks a notable shift for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, which have often faced heightened regulatory scrutiny due to concerns about illicit use. The decision suggests that Zcash’s privacy features alone were not deemed sufficient grounds for action under existing securities laws. The closure also aligns with a broader trend of the SEC withdrawing from several high-profile crypto investigations in recent months under new leadership. For Zcash, the end of the probe removes a regulatory overhang that had weighed on investor confidence for nearly two years. Market Reaction and Price Projections Following the announcement, ZEC surged between 5% and 14% across major exchanges, briefly testing the $440–$450 resistance zone. Currently, the token is trading around $427–$442, holding above the $400 psychological support level. Technically, ZEC remains in a consolidation phase after falling from its January high near $535. Resistance is clustered around $450–$470, while support sits near $400, with a deeper floor around $350 if sentiment weakens. Some analysts point to a symmetrical triangle pattern on longer timeframes, often viewed as a continuation structure after strong rallies. A confirmed breakout above the upper trendline could open the door toward higher levels, including a potential retest of the $1,000 mark later in 2026. Governance Uncertainty Clouds the Outlook Despite the regulatory win, internal challenges persist. Earlier this month, the full development team at Electric Coin Company (ECC), which has led core Zcash development, resigned following a dispute with its nonprofit board. Former ECC leaders cited deteriorating working conditions and have since announced plans to launch a new privacy-focused wallet, cashZ, based on Zcash technology.

    "title": "Sui Restores Service After Major 6-Hour Outage Shook Network",
    "body": "Sui’s blockchain resumed normal activity after a network stall that halted transactions for roughly six hours on January 14, 2026. According to reports, validators identified the problem in the mid-afternoon and worked to roll out a fix that restored block creation and transaction processing later that evening. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New Power Buyers: Companies Bought 3 Times What Miners Produced Outage Timeline And Recovery Based on reports, Sui’s team first flagged the issue at about 2:52 pm UTC when block production and checkpoint creation stopped. Validators applied changes and began bringing nodes back into sync. Service was reported as restored at about 8:44 pm UTC, a span of roughly five hours and 52 minutes from detection to recovery. During that interval, no new blocks were finalized and user activity stopped across wallets and decentralized apps. The Sui network is now back and fully operational. Transactions are flowing normally. If you are still seeing issues, please refresh your app or browser window. Thanks for your patience. We will share a full incident review in the coming days. Please check… — Sui (@SuiNetwork) January 14, 2026 Transactions Halted And Value Frozen The halt left a large amount of on-chain value inactive while the network was stalled. Reports indicate more than $1 billion in value was effectively frozen during the outage, though there were no signs of funds being stolen or altered. Users and apps that rely on the chain saw failed or queued transactions, and many dApps displayed errors until validators finished their updates. Cause, Response And Market Reaction Reports have disclosed that the problem was recorded as a consensus outage, meaning the mechanism used to agree on new blocks stopped finalizing. A full technical root-cause writeup has not yet been published. The Sui Foundation said an incident report will appear later with more detail. The SUI token showed modest movement during the event, trading around $1.80–$1.85 in the hours after the network came back, with a brief spike recorded on some exchanges as the news circulated. Past Interruptions And Context Sui launched mainnet in May 2023, and this outage follows previous incidents that raised similar questions about validator coordination and uptime. One earlier major disruption occurred in November 2024, which also involved issues around consensus and validator operation. Developers who build on Sui said many of their services experienced interrupted user flows while the chain was stalled. Related Reading: Russia Drafts Bill That Could Change Who Can Buy Crypto Questions About Network Reliability Some community members and outside observers have asked how often such consensus stalls can happen and what measures will reduce future occurrences. Validators and the Sui team said they were focused on patching the immediate bug and improving monitoring so problems are detected faster. Based on reports, the foundation plans to share specific steps for validators and node operators in the upcoming post-mortem. Sui’s team has said transactions are flowing again and advised users to refresh wallets or apps if they still see problems. The network’s operators have promised more transparency with a formal incident report, which will be watched closely by developers, exchanges, and investors who depend on the chain’s steady operation.

    "title": "Dogecoin Price Is Following This Bullish Signal With A Major Target",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has revealed that the Dogecoin price is following a bullish signal, which could lead to a rally above the $0.15 level. This comes as the crypto market rebounds, with Bitcoin rallying to a new yearly above $97,000. Dogecoin Price Eyes Rally Above $0.15 With This Bullish Signal In an X post, Trader Tardigrade hinted that the Dogecoin price could rally above $0.15 after rebounding from the Kumo support, which was exactly what the bullish signal flagged. The rebound comes amid the broader crypto market rally, with major crypto assets also recording significant gains as Bitcoin rallies above $97,000, with the psychological $100,000 level now in sight. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rapid Accumulation Suggests Sharp Upward Sweep Is Coming In another X post, Trader Tardigrade revealed that the Dogecoin price has formed a bull flag on the weekly chart and is now targeting the $0.195 price level. This will bring the leading meme coin close to the psychological $0.2 level, with a break above it paving the way for new local highs. Crypto analyst Crypto Tony highlighted the $0.154 level as being critical for the next leg up for the Dogecoin price. His accompanying chart showed that reclaiming this level would spark a rally above $0.16. One factor that could contribute to this bullish run for the foremost meme coin is renewed inflows into the Dogecoin ETFs. SoSoValue data shows that these Dogecoin ETFs still recorded zero flows on January 14 despite the rebound in the Dogecoin price. However, this could change soon, as these funds notably saw increased demand at the start of the year, when DOGE rallied to as high as $0.15, making it one of the best-performing crypto assets among the top 10 coins by market cap. What’s Next For DOGE As It Targets New Highs In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that a successful retest followed by a new local high will be further evidence that the corrective phase for the Dogecoin price has ended. This came as he noted that DOGE, like BTC and many other altcoins, has since come back and successfully tested its key 4-hour MAs after breaking out of them, attempting to end its major corrective phase. The analyst added that a new high would be a break of $0.157. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Are Surging Today Meanwhile, crypto analyst Bitcoinsensus has suggested that the Dogecoin price could rally to as high as $4.5 if DOGE is repeating its macro cycle pattern. The analyst noted that so far this cycle, the meme coin has maintained its ground and has mainly been moving sideways. As such, it remains to be seen if this cycle can be as explosive as the last ones. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.143, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Rally Accompanied By ‘Very Bullish’ Whale-Retail Behavior, Santiment Says",
    "body": "On-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed how Bitcoin is currently in a bullish zone based on the behavior of whale and retail investors. Bitcoin Major & Retail Entities Have Shown Opposite Trajectories Recently In a new post on X, Santiment has talked about how Bitcoin investor behavior currently compares between the top and low ends. Sharks and whales make up for the former category, while retail investors represent the latter. Formally, the wallet ranges of the two sides of the market are defined as 10 to 10,000 BTC and less than 0.01 BTC. Below is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Bitcoin supply held by each of these cohorts over the last few months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Turns ‘Neutral’ For First Time Since October As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin sharks and whales have seen their combined supply rise during the last few days, indicating that the large investors have been accumulating. Meanwhile, the retail investors have sold instead. This could imply that the big-money hands are backing the latest price rally, while small holders don’t believe the run will last, so they are exiting with their profits. If history is to go by, this may actually be a positive signal. According to the analytics firm, whale and retail behavior diverging in this manner puts the market in what it defines as the “Very Bullish” zone. “This is the ideal setup for a bull run,” noted Santiment. In the chart, the analytics firm has also highlighted four other zones for BTC based on the trajectories followed by the whale and retail supplies. “Very Bearish” (colored in red) follows the same contrarian logic as the Very Bullish region, with the zone appearing when large entities are selling, and retail is accumulating. Bearish (orange), Neutral (yellow), and Bullish (blue) map out the spectrum between the two extreme regions. Bitcoin’s latest venture into the green Very Bullish zone has come as sharks and whales have loaded up on 32,693 BTC (worth about $3.1 billion) since January 10th, corresponding to a supply increase of 0.24%. Retail investors have sold 149 BTC ($14.4 million) in this window instead, equivalent to a drop of 0.30%. Related Reading: Litecoin Whale Activity Spikes To 5-Week High: Reversal Or Continuation Signal? It now remains to be seen whether BTC will stay in this region for long or if another shift in investor behavior will take place. “How long it lasts depends on how long retail doubts the mini rally that has formed,” explains Santiment. BTC Price Bitcoin witnessed a break beyond the $97,000 level on Wednesday, but the bullish momentum has since cooled, with the BTC price returning to the $96,900 mark.
