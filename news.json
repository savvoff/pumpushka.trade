    "title": "Will Bitcoin Suffer A 20% Decline After Japan’s Rate Hike? Historical Patterns Suggest So",
    "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a 4% drop, falling below the $86,000 mark on Monday, as market speculation grows regarding the cryptocurrency’s future following the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) interest rate decision. In a recent poll conducted from December 2 to 9, an overwhelming 90% of economists—63 out of 70—predicted that the BOJ would increase short-term interest rates from 0.50% to 0.75% at this week’s planned meeting. Experts Warn Of Impact From BOJ Rate Hikes Experts on social media have noted a concerning trend: during the last three rate hikes by the BOJ, Bitcoin has typically dropped significantly. The statistics reveal the following declines: a 23% drop in March 2024, a 26% decline in July 2024, and a 31% dip in January of this year. Related Reading: Why XRP Isn’t Reacting to Major Institutional and Regional Developments Based on current prices just below $86,000, this would imply that if the cryptocurrency sees another 20% correction, it could drop all the way to 68,800. This would mean extending the gap compared to the all-time high of $126,000 by almost 46%. The group of experts further highlighted that the dynamics at play in Japan significantly impact Bitcoin’s performance as Japan holds the largest amount of US debt of any nation. When Japanese interest rates rise, capital tends to flow back to Japan, leading to reduced liquidity in dollars. This decrease in dollar liquidity often results in the selling of riskier assets like Bitcoin. On November 30, a foreboding sign of this potential downturn appeared when confirmation of Japan’s impending rate hike caused Bitcoin to dip to around $83,000, erasing approximately $200 billion from the overall cryptocurrency market. However, the bearish sentiment affecting Bitcoin is not solely the result of Japan’s actions. Market analyst known as NoLimit recently pointed to another critical factor: China’s renewed crackdown on Bitcoin mining. China’s Mining Crackdown Spurs Bitcoin Sell-Off The analyst recently asserted that China has tightened regulations, particularly affecting operations in Xinjiang, where a significant number of crypto mining setups were shut down in December. This led to the abrupt offline status of roughly 400,000 miners. The repercussions of such a sudden shift in mining activity are already evident. The Bitcoin network hashrate has fallen by about 8%, indicating that fewer miners are actively contributing to the network. NoLimit suggests that this sudden reduction creates immediate revenue-loss for miners, who may need to liquidate Bitcoin to cover operational costs or to relocate their equipment. Consequently, this generates actual selling pressure on the market, contributing to the downward price trend seen on Monday. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Compression Deepens as Analysts Debate if the Next Move Is a Rally or Breakdown Despite the short-term pain this creates, the analysts clarified that it does not indicate a long-term bearish outlook for Bitcoin. Instead, he views it as a temporary supply shock driven by regulatory decisions rather than a shift in demand. Historical patterns support this notion: when China has previously cracked down on miners, the cycle follows a familiar trajectory: miners are forced offline, hashrate dips occur, prices fluctuate, and eventually, the network adapts before Bitcoin moves forward again.

    "title": "US Bitcoin Session Leads December Returns After Weak November",
    "body": "Data shows Bitcoin has witnessed a notable amount of gains during the US trading session in December so far, a shift compared to the November trend. Bitcoin Has Performed The Best During US Trading Session This Month As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the American trading session has flipped for Bitcoin in December. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn, which compares the returns that BTC has achieved across the different trading sessions over the past month. The trading sessions here have been divided based on when investors of a major market are typically active. Bitcoin and other blockchain-based assets run 24/7, so there naturally isn’t ever a time in any timezone where trading is inactive. However, investors do still tend to trade more actively during their daytime, which is what these sessions are based on. From the chart, it’s visible that cumulative Bitcoin returns were negative for the American trading session during the last couple of weeks of November. Europe and Asia-Pacific didn’t perform much better, but they at least saw close to neutral returns. Related Reading: Cardano SuperTrend Turns Bearish—Last Signal Preceded 80% ADA Drop Toward the end of November, though, a shift began to take shape, with returns during US hours going up. And in this month of December so far, the trading session has pulled away from the rest, with cumulative returns sitting at a positive 8%. In contrast, Europe and Asia-Pacific have the metric at a level of around -4% or lower. Thus, if the cumulative returns during these sessions are anything to go by, it would appear that American investors have been participating in Bitcoin accumulation this month, while the others have been distributing or simply, not buying. In some other news, the Bitcoin selloff last month caused a key on-chain indicator to go through its largest negative change in years, as quant Frank has pointed out in an X post. The metric displayed in the chart is the Realized Price of the Bitcoin short-term holders. This indicator measures the average cost basis of investors on the BTC network. The version listed in the graph specifically tracks the cost basis of short-term holders (STHs), entities who entered the market over the last 155 days. As is visible in the chart, the Bitcoin STH Realized Price saw a notable decline alongside the price crash in the cryptocurrency during November. This suggests investors who bought at higher levels panic capitulated, repricing their coins to the lower post-plunge levels.

This capitulation was so strong that the STH Realized Price saw its largest red 7-day change since the FTX crash back in November 2022. BTC Price Bitcoin has witnessed bearish price action during the past day as its price has come down to $85,800 following a drop of about 3.5%.

    "title": "XRP Hasn’t Entered A Bear Market Yet; Analyst Shares Why",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Dark Defender has been one of the most vocal supporters of XRP, and this stance has not changed despite the altcoin’s current price action. If anything, the analyst believes that the current downtrend actually plays into the XRP long-term target, claiming that the cryptocurrency remains inherently bullish. If the analyst is right, then it means that the XRP price could be gearing up for another major uptrend that could send it to new peaks. XRP Price Is Only In Wave 4, Not A Bear Market In the post that was shared on X, Dark Defender explained that the XRP cryptocurrency was not in any kind of bear market. Instead, the current downtrend is only a result of the altcoin entering Wave 4 of the Elliot Wave, leading to the decline. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Still Hit $140,000? What The Global M2 Money Supply Says Given that Wave 4 is a historically bearish wave, it would explain why the XRP price has dropped so quickly. However, the crypto analyst explained that this wave did not just start, as it has been in play since February 2025. Hence, it would need to play out completely before the next wave can begin. Going by this analysis, it would mean that the last and final wave of the theory is yet to play out, which is often the most bullish of all the waves. As a result, the analyst urges XRP investors not to panic as the price continues to play out according to plan. In the end, the target remains $5.85, according to Dark Defender, beating its previous all-time high of $3.8. Price Could Be Rounding A Bottom Another analyst also contributes that the XRP price is not in a bear market, and could, in fact, be putting in a bottom. STEPH IS CRYPTO points out that the XRP RSI is actually showing a rare bullish divergence on the daily chart, one of the few times that this has happened over the years. Related Reading: Why Did The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP Prices Crash, And Will It Continue? This is significant because back in 2022, a similar bullish divergence had appeared on the daily chart ,and the result was a rapid rise once the distribution was done. As the crypto analyst explains, the fact that this bullish RSI divergence has appeared on the XRP daily chart again suggests that the sellers are actually running out of steam. While there is no set target for where the XRP price is headed, the prediction suggests that a rally could be in the works. “Nothing is guaranteed — but from a technical perspective, this is one of the strongest early reversal signals you can get,” the analyst stated.

    "body": "Dogecoin’s weekly price chart is revealing an interesting event of an important momentum indicator hitting a level that has always been a major turning point for the cryptocurrency. After spending the past several weeks falling lower into the $0.13 price region, Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index on the weekly timeframe has reached levels that have only appeared a handful of times over the asset’s entire trading history. The observation, first highlighted by crypto analyst Cryptollica, revisits how Dogecoin has behaved the last few times this technical condition happened. A Rare Weekly RSI Signal In Dogecoin’s History Technical analysis indicates that Dogecoin’s weekly Relative Strength Index has dropped into a narrow zone around the 33 level, a condition that has appeared only four times over roughly eleven years of trading history. Each of those occasions aligned with periods where selling pressure had largely run its course, even though price action itself did not immediately reverse. Instead, these phases were marked by quiet accumulation. Related Reading: XRP Dominates Institutional Inflows, But Why Is Price Still Low? The Dogecoin chart highlights these moments clearly, with pronounced RSI dips into the lower band during 2015, 2020, and 2022. In each case, price followed a similar script: extended basing ranges formed after the RSI reached this level, laying the groundwork for the next sustained advance. Now in late 2025, Dogecoin’s RSI is again exhibiting this same structural behavior, and this places the current price action in a way that might play out bullish. Short-term oversold readings are relatively common as reversal indicators, but they often produce false starts. However, since this is on the weekly timeframe, this specific setup tends to emerge only during broader market resets and is much more reliable. During those resets, the RSI stabilized and rebounded from the 30 to 33 zone as price gradually transitioned from consolidation into a new uptrend. Dogecoin Price Chart. Source: @Cryptollica On X What The Current RSI Setup Could Mean Going Forward As of mid-December 2025, Dogecoin is trading in the low-$0.13 to mid-$0.14 range, having slipped back below $0.14 that had been acting as short-term support in recent weeks. This price area has been volatile, with moves between roughly $0.13 and about $0.15, reflecting an ongoing struggle between buyers and sellers and a lack of decisive bullish momentum. The sellers are winning right now, with Dogecoin trading at $0.13, down by 5% in the past 24 hours and about to lose this price level.

Nonetheless, the weekly RSI that’s currently at the usually significant zone adds additional context. It proposes a scenario where Dogecoin is about to reach a price bottom and buyers regain control in the coming weeks. However, considering that this is a weekly indicator, Dogecoin’s price action might continue to consolidate around this level for the next few weeks before any meaningful bounce takes place.

    "title": "Dogecoin’s Selloff Tests Long-Held Beliefs as Traders Debate Capitulation or Reset",
    "body": "Dogecoin’s (DOGE) latest selloff has forced traders to confront a question that has followed the meme coin since its peak years. Is this another temporary washout, or a deeper reset in how the market values DOGE? Related Reading: XRP Hasn’t Entered A Bear Market Yet; Analyst Shares Why Over the past 24 hours, Dogecoin slipped sharply below levels that had held through weeks of consolidation, erasing a sense of stability that many participants had grown accustomed to. The move unfolded without a single defining catalyst, instead reflecting broader weakness across higher-beta crypto assets. At the same time, DOGE’s highly visible online presence has remained active, creating a contrast between weakening price action and persistent cultural relevance. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Breakdown Below Key Support Shifts Short-Term Structure In the past 24 hours, Dogecoin (DOGE) fell about 5.5%, sliding from roughly $0.1367 to near $0.129, and briefly trading as low as $0.1266. The drop pushed the price below the $0.1370 and $0.1300 support zones, levels that had defined the lower boundary of its recent range. Trading volume surged to around 1.36 billion tokens, more than 180% above average, suggesting the move was driven by active selling rather than gradual drift. Technically, DOGE is now trading below its 100-hour simple moving average, with a bearish trend line forming near $0.1340. Attempts to reclaim $0.1300 have so far failed, reinforcing that level as immediate resistance. Market participants note that once intermediate supports gave way, bid depth appeared thin, allowing the DOGE price to move lower with limited pauses. Sentiment Signals Clash With Weak Dogecoin Price Action Despite the selloff, Dogecoin remains a popular online presence. The official Dogecoin ecosystem account recently acknowledged renewed public endorsements, including comments from a high-profile entrepreneur, and resurfaced cultural callbacks tied to DOGE’s 2021 run. From a positioning standpoint, Dogecoin remains significantly below its all-time high and has declined sharply on a year-to-date basis. Open interest has also declined significantly from earlier 2025 peaks, pointing to reduced speculative participation. For some traders, this is evidence of capitulation; for others, it signals a quieter phase where excess leverage and hype are being flushed out. Levels That Now Matter for Traders In the near term, market focus is centered on the $0.1290–$0.1280 zone. Holding above this area could allow DOGE to consolidate, while a sustained break lower may expose support near $0.1250 and potentially the $0.1200 region. On the upside, a reclaim of $0.1300 would be the first indication that downside momentum is easing, though former supports above $0.1340 remain key hurdles.

    "title": "Private Investment Firm Shares Why XRP Is Their Leading Investment",
    "body": "A private investment firm has outlined why XRP constitutes the largest share of its portfolio. The firm explains that its investment rationale is anchored in XRP’s Proven operational performance and functional utility rather than aspirational projections, community momentum, or speculative price expectations. As a result, the position reflects a deliberate focus on infrastructure value, reinforcing XRP’s status as a core long-term holding rather than a tactical crypto trade. Why XRP Aligns With A Function-First Investment Approach The investment firm’s reasoning positions XRP as a natural fit for a portfolio strategy that prioritizes function over narrative. According to the firm, its heavy allocation is the byproduct of a disciplined evaluation of how well an asset performs its intended role. In this framework, concentration is justified only when an asset demonstrates clear operational strengths, and XRP is presented as having earned that status through its design and execution. Related Reading: Why Now Is The Perfect Opportunity To Short Bitcoin Down To $40,000 Building on that premise, the firm points to XRP’s specialization as a settlement-oriented digital asset as the primary driver of its allocation decision. The network is structured to deliver rapid and definitive transaction completion, eliminating the uncertainty that can complicate value transfer on many blockchain systems. This reliability is reinforced by consistently low transaction costs that remain stable regardless of usage levels, enabling predictable large-scale transfers without exposure to fee volatility. As transaction volume increases, XRP’s ability to maintain high throughput without congestion further supports its suitability for continuous, real-world payment activity. These technical attributes also connect directly to the firm’s broader investment thesis around institutional usability. By operating without a proof-of-work mechanism, the ledger avoids the inefficiencies and regulatory friction often associated with energy-intensive networks. In the firm’s assessment, this design choice enhances operational clarity and aligns more closely with the compliance and efficiency standards expected by financial institutions. Taken together, these factors explain why the firm views XRP less as a speculative vehicle and more as functional infrastructure, reinforcing its alignment with a function-first investment approach and justifying its central role within the portfolio. Positioning For Institutional Adoption And Market Repricing The firm frames its investment thesis around how markets evolve under regulatory pressure. As digital asset regulation advances, financial institutions are expected to prioritize reliability, compliance, and operational efficiency over popularity or community momentum. Adoption is therefore driven less by attention and more by seamless integration into existing financial frameworks. Related Reading: Here’s Why Strategy’s $1 Billion Bitcoin Purchase Did Not Trigger A Price Rally This perspective also informs how digital assets may be valued. The firm expects a gradual shift from narrative-based pricing toward metrics such as transaction throughput, liquidity efficiency, and real-world demand. Assets able to move value at scale will likely be repriced as usage rises and speculative excess fades. In the firm’s assessment, XRP is one of the few assets already meeting these standards, and by concentrating its portfolio in XRP, it positions itself ahead of this transition.

    "title": "Ethereum 2-Year Trend Maps Out This Unique Crash Path To Bottom At $2,187",
    "body": "Ethereum’s price action has weakened further over the past 24 hours, with the cryptocurrency falling below $3,000 and shedding about 6.8% in the last 24 hours alone. The immediate price action points to reclaiming this $3,000 support, but a longer-term technical view suggests the current decline may be part of a much larger and more defined price framework. A macro analysis shared by crypto analyst Dona examines Ethereum’s behavior over the past two years with a structured range that suggests that the cryptocurrency might bottom at $2,187. Ethereum’s Two-Year Range Still Defines The Bigger Picture According to the analysis, Ethereum has largely traded within a broad horizontal range for close to two years, aside from two notable fakeouts: one below resistance in the first half of 2025 and one above resistance in the second half of the year, which led to a new price high of $4,946 in August. On the weekly timeframe, price has repeatedly respected an upper boundary around $4,000 to $4,100, while finding consistent demand near the lower range support just above $2,100. Related Reading: Industry Leader Shares Why Ethereum Price Will Reach $12,000 This price action has resulted in a structure that resembles an inverse head and shoulders pattern on a macro scale. Instead of signaling immediate upside, however, the formation shows how price has oscillated between these defined trendlines, with mid-range reactions often determining whether Ethereum pushes to resistance or slips back toward support. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading within the mid-range of the two-year range. Based on this context, the recent bearish move can be viewed less as a breakdown and more as a rotation towards the lower trendline within the same long-standing range. Why $2,187 Stands Out As A Critical Downside Target The chart accompanying the analysis places particular emphasis on the lower boundary of the range near $2,187. This level has repeatedly acted as a bounce floor during prior downtrends in 2024 and another one in July 2025. Related Reading: What’s Happening With The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Recently? If Ethereum continues to trade below the mid-range support currently around $3,000, then the price could follow a familiar range rotation path toward this lower boundary. This move will see Ethereum fall to as low as $2,187. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,928, and is still a 25% decline away from $2,187. Although this would be tragic for bullish traders, such a move would not necessarily invalidate the broader structure. Instead, it will complete another cycle within the range, similar to previous declines that eventually transitioned into a bounce for a rally phase. One of the more notable aspects of the outlook from Dona is the expectation for subdued activity in the near term. Aside from range-bound trades, taking directional positions may be less attractive as liquidity thins into the end of the year. From this perspective, the next major move is more likely to arrive in January 2026. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

Related Reading: XRP Hasn’t Entered A Bear Market Yet; Analyst Shares Why The move comes amid a broader market pullback, as risk appetite weakens across equities and crypto, but ADA’s decline is also being shaped by internal technical signals that traders are finding hard to ignore. ADA currently trades near $0.38–$0.39, down approximately 5.57% over the past 24 hours. That drop places the token close to a multi-year ascending support trend line that has held for nearly 900 days. ADA's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Derivatives and Positioning Point to Caution Market data indicate that traders are stepping back rather than leaning into the decline. Futures open interest in ADA has decreased by approximately 11% to around $670 million, indicating that positions are being closed rather than expanded. Funding rates have also softened, with more than 55% of tracked positions now skewed to the short side. Together, these metrics point to reduced confidence in a near-term rebound and a market that is positioning defensively. This caution is not isolated to Cardano. Altcoins across the board have come under pressure as investors adopt a risk-off stance ahead of key U.S. macroeconomic data, including inflation and labor reports, and as concerns surrounding the AI sector spill over into correlated assets like cryptocurrency. Technical Structure Near a Breaking Point On the charts, ADA’s structure remains fragile. The token recently lost the $0.53 horizontal support, confirming a bearish shift on higher timeframes. Momentum indicators reflect that change. The RSI is below 50, and the MACD remains in a negative position. Recent price action looks corrective rather than impulsive, suggesting the latest bounce may already have run its course. ADA is still hovering near its long-term diagonal support, but a clean breakdown would likely alter the outlook materially. Some analysts warn that, if this trend line fails, the price could retrace much deeper, potentially toward levels last seen during the previous bear market. Long-Term Targets Contrast With Short-Term Risk Despite the weak near-term picture, longer-term projections remain divided. One technical analyst has argued that ADA’s current consolidation resembles a prolonged corrective phase similar to the setup seen before its 2020 breakout, outlining upside targets ranging from the $5 area to above $10 in a full bull scenario.

For now, ADA’s focus is simpler. The token is at a critical phase, with long-term support under pressure and sentiment cautious. Whether this level marks a base or a breakdown will likely shape Cardano’s trajectory into 2026. Cover image from ChatGPT, ADAUSD chart from Tradingview",

Clearing and settlement are handled inside systems compatible with US oversight, and the products are described as compliant with Commodity Futures Trading Commission frameworks. What Traders And Institutions Might Do Market participants say having regulated futures can change who trades a token. Institutional desks and some large funds often need regulated venues and clearer custody paths before they increase exposure. Added liquidity and round-the-clock pricing may attract more active traders, and that could raise volume. At the same time, access to futures also makes it easier to bet against the token, which can push volatility up. Reports note that immediate moves in spot markets have been mixed, showing that access to derivatives does not automatically lift the token’s price. Because SHIB has regulated futures on Coinbase (“1k Shib Index”), it qualifies for spot ETF consideration under the same SEC pathway Bitcoin and Ethereum followed.

    "title": "XRP Price Is Not Going To $100 By End Of Year, ‘You Need A Reality Check’",
    "body": "Despite the recent crash that saw the XRP price fall below $2, many analysts claim that the cryptocurrency could still skyrocket to $100 by the end of the year. However, one expert has thoroughly dismissed these projections, urging investors to temper expectations and warning that those who believe such predictions need a “reality check.” Why XRP Can Never Reach $100 By Year’s End Crypto market expert Zach Humphries has delivered a detailed assessment of XRP, calling out extreme price predictions and overly optimistic expectations, especially during the current downtrend. In a video on X, he warns that claims suggesting XRP will reach $100 by the end of 2025 are unrealistic and potentially misleading for investors and traders. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts How Low The XRP Price Will Go Before Bouncing Humphries emphasized that while he supports XRP and believes in its long-term potential, the spread of exaggerated price targets in the crypto space is harmful. He explained that many investors assume that owning 100 XRP tokens will make them wealthy quickly, holding on to false hope and unrealistic financial expectations. The analyst points out the need for realism in the crypto space, arguing that viral hype posts and overinflated price forecasts can hoodwink people into making genuine financial decisions that could lead to losses. He noted that investors need to understand market structure and the underlying math behind XRP’s price action before believing in any extreme predictions. Humphries stated a $100 XRP price would imply a $5 trillion market capitalization, surpassing the size of Apple, Microsoft, and even the entire crypto market at some historical peaks. He noted that reaching this seemingly impractical price target would require XRP achieving overnight global adoption, full-scale replacement of existing payment rails, and massive sustained institutional inflows. The analyst also highlighted a common misunderstanding about liquidity. Humphries explained that for XRP to reach $100, it would require substantial global liquidity. He noted that despite XRP Spot ETFs recording over $1 billion in inflows recently, the cryptocurrency’s price did not rise; instead, it declined further. He highlighted that this is because institutional investors prioritize stability, deep liquidity, and predictability over volatile, high-risk payment assets. Although his statements may seem like a critique of XRP’s outlook, Humphries emphasized that the cryptocurrency has genuine strengths, including robust cross-border payment capabilities, strong enterprise relationships, and liquidity. He pointed out that, ironically, the more XRP succeeds as a payment rail, the less explosive its price becomes. Analyst Says XRP Could Still Outperform Many Assets In his video, Humphries stated that XRP has survived many market cycles, making it one of the rare resilient cryptocurrencies. Under the right conditions, he believes that the XRP price could outperform many digital assets, which is why it remains a top altcoin in his portfolio. Related Reading: XRP Price To Reach $27: The Technical Formation That Paints 1,300% Surge The analyst emphasized the importance of realistic growth driven by gradual institutional adoption, ETF integration, regulatory clarity, and steady price increases tied to actual usage and utility. He highlighted that these factors could help XRP perform very well, potentially reaching new all-time highs. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Under Pressure As Yen Carry Trade Unwind Hits Global Markets",
    "body": "The yen carry trade unwind has been hovering over markets lately — the kind of “plumbing” story that most people ignore right up until volatility spikes and everything suddenly feels connected. Graham Stephan put it into a Bitcoin and crypto-friendly frame yesterday. In a Dec. 15 post, the popular YouTuber described the yen carry trade as Wall Street’s long-running “infinite money glitch” — and argued it’s breaking down just as the Fed is signaling a shift in its outlook for next year. “Wall Street found an ‘infinite money’ glitch 20 years ago. They called it the Yen Carry Trade. It just broke, right when the Fed announced its plans for next year,” Stephan wrote. What The Yen Carry Trade Unwind Means For Bitcoin He presented it as a straightforward trade that scaled because the size was big enough to matter. “For decades, the ‘Yen Carry Trade’ has been the secret engine behind global liquidity. The mechanics were simple enough that a child could understand them, but profitable enough to move trillions of dollars.” Related Reading: Market Stress Continues As Bitcoin STH SOPR Dips Below 1– When Will The Pain End? Stephan then laid out the basic steps in plain English: borrow cheaply in Japan, rotate into higher-yield US assets, keep the spread. “Borrow Cheap: Investors borrowed money in Japan, where interest rates were effectively 0%… Invest Abroad: They took that ‘free money’ and bought US Treasuries paying 4-5%… Profit: They pocketed the difference without using any of their own money.” His argument is that the setup turns toxic when the rate differential compresses and the currency leg moves the wrong way. He framed the timing as especially awkward for risk assets: Japan tightening to support the yen while the Fed eases. “Japan is finally raising rates to save its own currency right at the time when the Fed has started slashing rates. The gap between the rates is getting squeezed. The ‘free money’ isn’t free anymore.” From there, he leaned into the mechanical consequence: when funding gets more expensive and the currency shifts, leveraged positions don’t get a long debate window — they get cut. “As Japanese rates rise, that trade flips. Investors are now being forced to sell their US assets to pay back their Yen loans. Instead of money flowing into the US markets, it is being sucked out to pay debts in Tokyo. This is a massive liquidity drain happening right under our noses.” That’s also where his Bitcoin read comes in. Not “Bitcoin is broken,” but that Bitcoin is where risk appetite and leverage tend to show up early — and where forced selling can look brutal when it hits. Stephan expanded on the same theme in a Substack post, pulling the Fed into the timeline more directly and warning readers to brace for turbulence. “You better get ready for a bumpy ride,” he wrote, claiming the Fed cut rates “for the third time this year,” and that the central bank “has officially ended ‘Quantitative Tightening’ and is quietly moving back toward printing money.” Related Reading: US Bitcoin Session Leads December Returns After Weak November He added a “pilot flying blind” angle as well, arguing the Fed cut “without any inflation data whatsoever” due to shutdown-related disruptions. He attached a specific interpretation of balance-sheet policy, too: “Finally, the most important news of the day: Quantitative Tightening (QT) is over… They even announced they will buy $40 billion of Treasuries over the next 30 days. The tightening era is dead. The ‘stimulus’ era is now being rebooted, and the money printer is being turned on.” Taken together, his thesis ends up with Bitcoin sitting between two forces that don’t necessarily move on the same clock: a potentially sharp deleveraging impulse from carry unwinds, and a slower easing impulse if policy conditions loosen. One can hit price violently in a short window; the other can take time to express itself cleanly. Stephan closed with a familiar Bitcoin-with-training-wheels framing: volatility is normal, drawdowns happen, and mining economics create a reference point. “Bitcoin isn’t broken. It’s just volatile, and this isn’t the first time this is happening. Statistically, Bitcoin has seen drastic crashes of 50% or more, but it has never dropped below its “electrical cost” (the cost to mine one coin), which sits around $71,000 today. If we get close to that number, history suggests it’s a strong buy zone,” he concluded. At press time, BTC traded at $87,082. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Falls Below $2 As $721 Million Profit-Take Hits Market",
    "body": "One of the cleaner tells in crypto is when the old supply decides it’s time. Not “made a quick 20% and clipped it” time — years old. That’s basically what Glassnode researcher CryptoVizArt flagged after an XRP wallet aged roughly 5–7 years (with a cost basis around $0.40) realized more than $721.5 million in profit on Dec. 11. A single wallet doesn’t “break” a market on its own. But the timing is the point: this wasn’t profit-taking into a rip. It landed while XRP was showing weakness right at the $2.0 key level. Related Reading: XRP Dominates Institutional Inflows, But Why Is Price Still Low? CryptoVizArt wrote via X: “On December 11th, a 5-7 year old XRP wallet address (with a cost basis of $0.4) realized over $721.5M in profit! A rare sizable profit-taking while the price shows weakness right at the $2.0 key level.” What This Means For XRP Price That $2 handle matters for the usual reasons — round number, obvious chart magnet, psychological line in the sand — but also because the market’s been treating it like a live wire lately. Since early December last year, the support zone between $2 and $1.90 has been tested endless times. XRP bulls always managed to close above the zone on the weekly timeframe. So what does the $721M print mean? It’s a reminder that supply overhang isn’t theoretical. A 5–7 year wallet taking profits can be read as “de-risking,” sure. But in tape terms, it’s also distribution that the market has to absorb while price is already leaning. If bids are deep, it’s a shrug. If bids are thin, it turns $2 into a trapdoor. And right now, “thin” is kind of the vibe across crypto, not just XRP. Related Reading: Why XRP Isn’t Reacting to Major Institutional and Regional Developments CryptoVizArt’s broader framing from Dec. 13 is that the $80K–$90K Bitcoin consolidation is producing stress “comparable to late Jan 2022.” Via X, he wrote: “The current $80K–$90K consolidation range is generating a magnitude of stress comparable to late January 2022, with Relative Unrealized Loss approaching ~10% of market cap. This places the market in a regime where liquidity is constrained, and sensitivity to macro shocks is elevated, yet still below the levels typically associated with full bear-market capitulation.” That backdrop matters because alts don’t trade in a vacuum. When the whole complex is jumpy, big sell events at key levels have more punch. Not because every XRP holder suddenly panics, but because market-makers and discretionary traders tend to pull risk at the same time. Spreads widen, depth thins, and “one-off” flows start to move price more than they should. Still, it cuts both ways. A single, chunky realization can also be the market clearing a problem — old supply exiting, new demand stepping in, the kind of transfer that (eventually) makes a base sturdier. The trick is whether $2 holds while that handoff happens. At press time, XRP was trading at $1.89, which could make Sunday’s weekly close another extremely important event.

    "title": "XRP Liquidity Dries Up: Futures Buy Volume On Binance Falls from $5.8B to $250M",
    "body": "XRP has slipped below the $2 level, a psychologically important threshold, as broader market conditions continue to deteriorate and selling pressure weighs on risk assets. While Bitcoin dominates liquidity and investor attention, altcoins are struggling to attract sustained demand, and XRP is increasingly reflecting this imbalance. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin’s Quiet Price Action May Be ‘Dangerous’ – IFP Signals Rising Structural Risk According to a CryptoQuant report by Darkfost, the weakness in XRP is not an isolated event but part of a broader contraction across the altcoin market. Whether on spot markets or in derivatives, trading activity has been shrinking significantly over recent months. Liquidity is gradually drying up, signaling a clear retreat from speculative positioning as investors reduce exposure to higher-risk assets. This trend is especially visible in XRP’s derivatives data. The Taker Buy Volume on Binance, which tracks aggressive buy orders in futures markets, has collapsed to its lowest levels of the year. After peaking above $5.8 billion in July, this metric has fallen to roughly $250 million, representing a sharp 95.7% decline. Such a dramatic contraction highlights the near-total evaporation of buying pressure and underscores the lack of conviction among traders. XRP Liquidity Compression Signals Downside Risk According to Darkfost, the broader market context is a major factor amplifying XRP’s current weakness. Liquidations have been accumulating across crypto markets, confidence remains fragile, and many participants are still psychologically impacted by the October 10 event. This lingering stress has reduced risk tolerance, particularly among short-term traders who typically provide liquidity during corrective phases. Beyond sentiment, altcoins are facing a clear structural headwind. Bitcoin continues to absorb the majority of available capital, both in spot and derivatives markets. As BTC dominance remains elevated, liquidity that would normally rotate into altcoins during recoveries is instead staying concentrated in Bitcoin. This leaves very limited room for a sustained rebound across the broader altcoin market, including XRP. Related Reading: Market Stress Continues As Bitcoin STH SOPR Dips Below 1– When Will The Pain End? Within this environment, the sharp collapse in XRP’s Taker Buy Volume is not surprising. The signal becomes even more relevant given that it is unfolding on Binance, which still accounts for the largest share of global XRP trading activity. A sustained drop in aggressive buying on the dominant exchange highlights the depth of demand erosion. At the same time, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio has remained negative for most of the period, confirming that sellers continue to dominate XRP’s derivatives market. Historically, such severe volume compression can precede volatility expansions. However, in the current setup, the lack of meaningful buying pressure and persistent bearish positioning suggests downside risks remain elevated. Even ETF-related optimism has failed to offset these structural weaknesses. XRP Price Struggles Below Key Moving Averages XRP price action on the 3-day chart reflects a clear loss of bullish structure and growing downside pressure. After peaking above the $3.40–$3.60 zone earlier in the year, XRP has formed a sequence of lower highs and lower lows, confirming a medium-term downtrend. The recent breakdown below the psychological $2.00 level is particularly significant, as this zone previously acted as both support and consolidation. From a technical perspective, XRP is now trading below its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which have started to slope downward. This alignment reinforces bearish momentum and suggests that rallies are being sold rather than accumulated. The 200-day moving average, currently near the $1.70–$1.80 area, represents the next major structural support. A sustained move toward this level would not be surprising if selling pressure persists. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Refuse to Sell: Historic Signal Emerges As Binance CDD Drops To 2017 Levels Volume dynamics further confirm weakness. Since the August high, volume has steadily declined, indicating fading participation and weak dip-buying interest. The sharp volatility spike in October was followed by distribution rather than continuation, often a sign of a local market top. As long as XRP remains below $2.00 and fails to reclaim the declining moving averages, the path of least resistance remains to the downside. For any meaningful trend reversal, XRP would need to regain $2.30–$2.50 with expanding volume, signaling renewed demand rather than short-term relief rallies.

    "body": "According to a Grayscale outlook released Monday, the asset manager expects rising demand for alternatives and clearer rules in the US to push Bitcoin to a new all-time high in the first half of 2026. Related Reading: Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund The report lays out 10 key investing themes for 2026 and ties the Bitcoin call to two main forces: growing portfolio demand for stores of value and what Grayscale describes as improving regulatory clarity. Spot-Bitcoin ETPs reached the market in 2024, the firm notes, and Congress passed the GENIUS Act in 2025, steps that the report says reduce barriers for big investors. Macro Risks And Demand For Crypto Grayscale frames its outlook around a simple macro point. Rising public debt and the risk that fiat currencies lose buying power are pushing some money toward Bitcoin and Ether, the report says. That argument will sound familiar to many institutional buyers. It is also a broad claim. No exact price targets were offered for Bitcoin, only a view that valuations will climb in 2026 and that the so-called four-year cycle may be ending. Stablecoins are another major theme. Grayscale expects stablecoin use to grow: cross-border payments, collateral on derivatives, even use on corporate balance sheets are all mentioned as likely developments. Asset Tokenization And DeFi Growth Reports have disclosed that Grayscale sees asset tokenization reaching an inflection point next year. Lending protocols and staking are singled out as areas where activity could expand. The firm foresees practical outcomes: stablecoins in payment rails, more institutional access to staking, and tokenized assets showing up in trading and custody systems. Grayscale also flags two narratives it does not expect to move markets in 2026 — quantum computing risk for crypto and digital asset treasuries — saying research will continue but valuations are unlikely to be affected this soon.

That has not translated into strong faith in leadership. A separate institutional feed, Bitcoin Vector, said dominance fell in the second half of the year, with ETH rotations cutting into BTC’s lead and a weaker rebuild after deleveraging events.

    "title": "Bitcoin Bottom Forecast: Top Expert Predicts $40,000 Target Next Year, Here’s The Analysis",
    "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been struggling to regain momentum in the market, failing to surpass its nearest resistance level of $94,000 for over a month. The cryptocurrency is currently trading within a broad range between $85,000 and $93,000, leading to growing concerns about further price corrections in the upcoming months. Amid this uncertainty, market expert NoLimit recently expressed on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that he anticipates Bitcoin could bottom out at around $40,000 sometime in 2026. This forecast implies a significant 54% decline from current levels, which are just above $87,860. A Historical Perspective On Market Cycles NoLimit’s analysis outlines several reasons for this predicted downturn. He points out that Bitcoin has a historical tendency to surprise investors, often when confidence in the market is high. While each price cycle may appear unique on the surface, NoLimit argues that the underlying mechanics remain largely unchanged. He emphasizes the cyclical nature of Bitcoin, noting that it moves within a four-year cycle influenced by liquidity, leverage, and human behavior rather than mere sentiment. According to him, the market is currently late in this cycle, and Bitcoin has consistently followed a three-step process during past upward movements. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecast: Key Factors That Could Propel It To $3 In Early 2026 First, Bitcoin tends to surge in price following the Halving event. This is typically followed by an influx of maximum leverage and late-stage buyers. Finally, the cycle concludes with a sharp and often chaotic reset before the next significant price expansion occurs. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced steep declines during these resets, such as an approximate 85% drop in 2013-2014, an 84% drop in 2017-2018, and a 77% drop during the 2021-2022 cycle. In each scenario, investors were convinced that the conditions were different, yet the outcomes remained consistent. $40,000 As Foundation For Bitcoin’s Next Bull Run Considering the current market situation, NoLimit highlights several critical indicators. He notes that Bitcoin has already seen substantial price appreciation, with institutional interest and exchange-trade fund (ETF) approvals now part of the landscape. He also observes that many traders are over-leveraged, market volatility is compressed, and there exists widespread hope for further price increases. These factors often signal a heightened risk of downside movement in the market. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Suffer A 20% Decline After Japan’s Rate Hike? Historical Patterns Suggest So A potential drop toward the $40,000 range should not be viewed as an unforeseen disaster, according to NoLimit. He argues that significant price declines have historically preceded major upward movements. Additionally, this price target aligns well with several technical indicators, including previous resistance levels that have turned into support, long-term moving averages, and the liquidity gap created by ETF approvals. Such factors suggest that a move toward this region could exhaust forced sellers and provide a solid foundation for recovery. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

The disclosure landed plenty of attention online and reignited debate about who is buying what and why.

Several industry figures echoed Arrington’s mix; Tony Edward, for example, listed XRP with BTC and ETH when discussing core positions. The debate was loud and fast on social feeds.

Mine are XRP, BTC, ETH and IMX — Michael Arrington 🏴‍☠️ (@arrington) December 13, 2025 Institutional Moves Follow Based on reports, Arrington’s public support is tied to direct institutional activity. In October, Arrington Capital joined Ripple and SBI Holdings to back an initiative by Evernorth aimed at building a large institutional XRP treasury. The project, which has been described in some circles as among the biggest of its kind, aims to increase institutional use of XRP and to support on-ledger activity such as decentralized finance and lending. That involvement means Arrington is more than a vocal supporter; he is also tied to projects that could change how institutions use the token. XRP Market Moves And Key Figures XRP’s market picture has been mixed. As of December 16, 2025, the token was trading around $1.98, having held in a roughly $2.00 to $2.20 band in recent sessions. There was a small daily lift of about 1.2% to roughly $2.08 on Monday, which helped the token cover some ground after early-December weakness. The year has seen bigger swings: XRP peaked near $3.65 in July before giving back some gains. Activity in regulated derivatives has also grown. Reports point to XRP futures on the CME reaching a record open interest of roughly $3 billion in late October 2025, a figure that market watchers say reflects rising institutional appetite for regulated exposure. Related Reading: Analyst: Bitcoin’s Cycle Is Intact, Yet No Longer Purely Market-Driven A Past Claim That No Longer Holds Arrington has previously highlighted XRP’s strong performance. In March, he tweeted that XRP had been the best-performing major asset across multiple time frames — 90 days, 180 days, one year and three years. That claim no longer lines up with current rankings.

    "title": "Cantor Fitzgerald Projects Major Growth For Hyperliquid (HYPE) In Explosive New Report",
    "body": "Cantor Fitzgerald, one of the world’s leading asset management firms, has released an in-depth report highlighting the promising future of the decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid (HYPE). The 62-page analysis predicts significant growth for both the platform and its native token over the next decade, painting a bullish outlook for investors. Hyperliquid As ‘The Exchange Of All Exchanges’ As detailed in the report, Hyperliquid operates as a decentralized exchange specializing in trading perpetual futures and is built on a custom layer-1 blockchain. Currently, HYPE has a fully diluted market cap of approximately $15.8 billion. Year-to-date (YTD) 2025, the platform has generated an impressive $874 million in fees from a staggering $2.947 trillion in trading volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom Forecast: Top Expert Predicts $40,000 Target Next Year, Here’s The Analysis A key feature that makes HYPE particularly attractive, and highlighted in the report, is its unique fee structure: approximately 99% of all fees generated by the protocol are allocated to repurchasing and burning the underlying token. This mechanism not only supports the value of HYPE but also reduces its circulating supply. In early 2025 alone, about 2.6% of all HYPE tokens expected to be in circulation, or roughly 5% of the current supply, were repurchased and burned. With the anticipation of new product launches, Cantor Fitzgerald views HYPE as “the exchange of all exchanges” and believes there’s a realistic path for annual fees to soar to $5 billion within the next decade. Why Market Dynamics Favor HYPE When it comes to the platform’s native token, HYPE has successfully captured considerable market share and emerged as one of the standout products in the cryptocurrency space over the past year. In addition to perpetual trading, Hyperliquid has launched spot trading and HIP-3 markets, enabling users to create new markets for a variety of assets including stocks and commodities. Cantor Fitzgerald’s report emphasizes that the immediate determinant of HYPE’s market price will hinge on industry sentiment regarding competition. The ability of emerging rivals to challenge HYPE and affect its fee-generating capacity is paramount. However, the report argues that current fears surrounding competition may be overstated. It posits that “point tourists”—those who shift from platform to platform seeking incentives—are likely to return to the platform offering the deepest liquidity and best execution, which, according to Cantor Fitzgerald, is Hyperliquid. A mere 1% increase in market share from CEX competitors in the perpetuals sector could translate to approximately $600 billion in trading volume. Based on existing perpetual fee rates, this could result in an additional $272 million in annual fees. By applying a conservative 25x valuation multiple to these fees, the potential market capitalization would rise to $6.8 billion. HYPE Price To Reach $271? Assuming moderate share gains over the next decade—projecting around 17% in perpetual trades and 18% in spot trading—Hyperliquid’s annual fees could surpass the $5 billion mark. A conservative valuation multiple of 25x, this would suggest a future market capitalization of approximately $125 billion. Given that nearly all generated fees will be used to repurchase HYPE tokens, a large portion of the circulating supply could potentially be bought back by the time the platform reaches these fee levels. With a forecasted expansion of the fully diluted market cap from roughly $15.8 billion today to $125 billion in the future, combined with a declining supply of HYPE tokens, the projected share price is poised to increase at an even faster pace. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecast: Key Factors That Could Propel It To $3 In Early 2026 If 20% of the Hyperliquid token float is repurchased—valued at around $3.5 billion today—the report suggests that the HYPE price could reach $271 at a fully diluted valuation of $125 billion. The projections suggest that if HYPE captures just 1% of the market share annually and maintains consistent trading volumes from CEXs, the price of HYPE could grow substantially. By year 10, the asset manager believes that circulating supply could decrease from 577.2 million to approximately 144.9 million, while the market cap could remain around $16.1 billion based on conservative fee estimates excluding spot and HIP-3 revenues. At the time of writing, Hyperliquid’s native token is trading at $26.49, having recorded major losses of almost 32% over the past month. This represents a 55% gap from the current trading levels and the all-time high of $59.30. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Why Ethereum Is Chosen As A Settlement Layer For New Money Market Fund",
    "body": "In a significant milestone for the evolution of on-chain finance, a new money market fund has selected Ethereum as its primary settlement layer toward blockchain-native infrastructure for traditional financial products. This decision reflects growing confidence in ETH security, scalability, ecosystem maturity, and qualities that institutional investors and asset managers increasingly demand when moving regulated financial instruments onto public blockchains. How The New On-Chain Settlement Improves Operational Efficiency The largest money whale in institutional finance just made its biggest move by launching a new money market fund on Ethereum, and it’s coming from J.P. Morgan Asset Management. According to an analyst known as Milk Road on X, the company oversees roughly $4 trillion in client assets, and seeds these funds with $100 million of its own capital before opening them up to the public. This fund is called My On-Chain Net Yield Fund (MONY), which is similar to a normal money market fund. Related Reading: Ethereum Emerges As A Dollar Settlement Powerhouse, Outpacing Traditional Payment Networks – Details It is set to hold assets designed to preserve capital and remain liquid. A key difference between the fund and others is that shares are issued and tracked on ETH using JPMorgan’s Kinexys platform. The feature allows the fund to settle faster, issue and redeem shares continuously, and transfer ownership without waiting on the traditional clearing system. Furthermore, this product is limited to large investors, individuals with at least $5 million investments, and institutions with $25 million, including a $1 million minimum to get started. The risk profile and purpose are familiar, and it’s a safe yield for investors. Meanwhile, for JPMorgan, this is a major operational upgrade offering faster cash transactions, tighter integration with treasury systems, and smoother collateral movement. Larger asset managers are starting by moving the safest, most conservative products on-chain first, because that’s where efficiency gains would show up immediately. “Adoption is accelerating,” Milk Road noted. Why Ethereum Is More Than Just Technology According to AdrianoFeria, the world’s greatest misunderstanding of Ethereum is viewing it solely as a technology. AdrianoFeria has pointed out that ETH is a network of economic actors coordinating around shared rules. It is also a social contract and a system that is designed to enable collaboration in the most adverse situations. Related Reading: Here’s Why Ethereum Emerges As The Global Capital Rails For On-Chain Finance At the core, ETH functions as a global and neutral arbitrator. Over time, it has proven itself to be the most long-standing, reliable, and trustworthy neutral arbitrator in the world. This arbitrator is the most valuable aspect of ETH, and any valuable model must account for it to have a chance of estimating realistic ETH price targets. “If you are stuck with a cash flow-centric valuation for ETH, then it is time to sit down and study the system more deeply, and if you believe cash flow explains most of ETH’s value, you haven’t dug deep enough,” the expert mentioned.

    "body": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets have witnessed a sharp retrace during the last 24 hours, which has resulted in a long squeeze on derivatives exchanges. Crypto Long Liquidations Have Neared $600 Million During The Past Day According to data from CoinGlass, the latest sharp price action in the cryptocurrency market has accompanied a huge amount of liquidations over at the derivatives side of the sector. Related Reading: US Bitcoin Session Leads December Returns After Weak November “Liquidation” here naturally refers to the forceful closure that any open contract has to undergo after it has amassed losses of a certain degree. For long investors, this happens when the asset’s price drops, while for shorts, liquidation occurs after a surge. How much the cryptocurrency will have to move in one direction to liquidate a specific position comes down to the percentage threshold defined by the platform and the amount of leverage that the trader has opted for. During sharp price swings, positions with high amounts of leverage attached are the first to go. Bitcoin and other assets have faced some notable volatility during the past day, which has once again caught out traders on the derivatives market. As the table below shows, liquidations have crossed $650 million over the last 24 hours. About $584 million of these liquidations involved long positions alone. That’s equivalent to almost 90% of the total, showcasing how disproportionate the price volatility has been during this period. In terms of the individual symbols, the largest contributor to the liquidation event has been Ethereum, not Bitcoin, as is often the case. With over $235 million in contracts involved, Ethereum has notably outpaced Bitcoin, which has witnessed $186 million in liquidations. ETH facing more liquidations is likely due to the fact that its price drawdown has been stronger during the past day. Out of the altcoins, Solana has come out on top with $37 million in positions flushed, ahead of XRP ($16 million) and Dogecoin ($12 million). Interestingly, SOL has outperformed the two despite its losses being more limited. In some other news, the latest Bitcoin decline has meant that its price has fallen back under a key on-chain price level, as the chart shared by analytics firm Glassnode shows. The level in question is the Active Realized Price, corresponding to the cost basis of the active participants on the Bitcoin network. Currently, it’s located at $87,900, which is above the cryptocurrency’s spot price.

    "body": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially concluded its investigation into the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Aave (AAVE), marking a significant development in the ongoing evolution of regulatory approaches within the cryptocurrency industry. Stani Kulechov, the founder and CEO of the Aave protocol, confirmed the end of the four-year investigation in a post on social media, expressing relief and optimism about the future of DeFi. Aave Founder Celebrates End Of SEC Investigation In his announcement, Kulechov emphasized the considerable effort and resources invested by the Aave team throughout this process. He stated, “We are finally ready to share that the SEC has concluded its investigation into the Aave Protocol.” Highlighting the impact of regulatory scrutiny on DeFi, he added, “This process demanded significant effort… to protect Aave, its ecosystem, and DeFi more broadly.” Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Suffer A 20% Decline After Japan’s Rate Hike? Historical Patterns Suggest So Kulechov expressed hope for a new chapter in which developers can freely innovate and contribute to the future of finance, asserting, “DeFi will win.” This conclusion is notable against the backdrop of heightened regulatory pressure that DeFi projects have faced in recent years. Under the previous SEC chair, Gary Gensler, the agency made a concerted effort to enforce regulations in the crypto space. In 2021, the SEC initiated 19 enforcement actions related to cryptocurrency in just the first nine months. However, recent patterns reveal a substantial shift in the commission’s stance on crypto enforcement. SEC Eases Crypto Enforcement Actions By Over 60% Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, the SEC has reportedly eased enforcement actions in over 60% of ongoing cryptocurrency cases. A New York Times investigation published recently analyzed thousands of government documents and court records, revealing that the SEC has either dismissed, paused, or reduced penalties for a significant majority of active crypto cases since January 20, 2021. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecast: Key Factors That Could Propel It To $3 In Early 2026 While Trump’s first term saw an average of one high-profile cryptocurrency case per month—including the notable action against Ripple Labs—the current landscape indicates a less aggressive regulatory approach for major players like Binance, Ripple, and Gemini. Following the administration shift, enforcement actions against these companies have either been withdrawn or significantly softened. Paul S. Atkins, the newly appointed SEC chair under the Trump administration, has labeled this regulatory shift a “new day” for the cryptocurrency industry. At the time of writing, the protocol’s native token, AAVE, was trading at $187, having only surged by 1% following the announcement. However, on a year-to-date basis, the AAVE token has seen a significant 52% drop, with prices currently 72% down from the all-time high of $661 reached in May 2021.

New Year Volatility Hits Crypto Markets Hard Efloud, in a recent update, highlighted that with the start of the new year and continued uncertainty across the markets, cryptocurrencies have once again been among the hardest hit. Low trading volume and a lack of clear direction have kept pressure on the sector, and without an obvious reversal signal, altcoins continue to grind lower day by day.

As emphasized in previous analyses, any attempt to trade against the prevailing trend at support levels should be backed by clear bullish breakout structures on lower timeframes. Without such confirmation, moves higher are more likely to be short-lived reactions rather than meaningful reversals. From a technical standpoint, XRP’s price has now lost the “Daily Imb” zone, weakening the overall structure. If price dips below the most recent swing low and then attracts buying interest, the $1.98 area is expected to act as the first major resistance. As previously noted, the outlook remains negative unless the YO region is reclaimed. Beyond $1.98, another key resistance lies within the red boxed zone. Together, $1.98, the YO area, and the red boxed region form three critical hurdles where price is likely to face selling pressure in the near term. Price Action Still Outweighs ETF Optimism According to Efloud, while spot XRP ETFs have posted positive closes for 18 consecutive days, this development alone does not outweigh what the chart itself is signaling. He emphasized that price action and market structure remain the most important factors. Until these begin to shift in a clearly bullish direction, any purchases are better seen as part of a gradual accumulation strategy rather than a confirmation of a trend reversal.

Efloud added that if market suppression continues and a sharper correction unfolds, the area around $1.53 could emerge as a potential buy zone. However, this scenario depends on broader market behavior and is not a certainty. Finally, the analyst clarified that the $1.53 level was illustrated as a hypothetical example. Efloud warned that entering positions at support zones or key levels without observing clear breakout or reversal structures carries added risk and should be approached with caution.

    "title": "XRP Price Must Defend This Level To Avoid 50% Breakdown, Analyst Warns",
    "body": "As the crypto market recovers from the latest pullback, XRP is attempting to climb up from its recent lows. Some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency must defend its current levels or risk a 50% drop to levels not seen since 2024. Related Reading: Solana Leads As Most Popular Blockchain Ecosystem For Second Consecutive Year – Report XRP At Make-Or-Break Level Amid the start-of-week market correction, XRP recorded a 6% drop toward its lowest level in weeks. The price lost $2.00 support on Monday morning and continued to lose key levels despite uninterrupted institutional interest. The cryptocurrency has been trading within the $2.00-$2.25 price range over the past month, only losing its lower boundary during the late November pullback. Monday’s correction sent the altcoin below the range’s lower support again, hitting a multi-week low of $1.88 before bouncing around an area that has been crucial for the past year. Notably, XRP has bounced from the $1.85-$1.90 support zone after every major correction since the November 2024 breakout, climbing back above the $2.00 level each time. However, some market observers have suggested that the price risks a significant correction if it is unable to hold the current levels. Ali Martinez pointed out that the cryptocurrency has fallen below its one-year price range, between the $1.92-$3.27 levels, which could lead to a 50% drop below this area. To the analyst, XRP’s price must secure a daily close above $1.92 to prevent a drop to the $1.00 support, which has not been seen in over a year. Similarly, Cheds Trading affirmed that XRP is “flirting with a high time frame breakdown.” Per the chart, the altcoin appears to be forming a high-timeframe rounding top or double top pattern with a higher high. The analyst noted that in the case of the latter, the M formation would be confirmed if the $1.88 level, where the pattern’s neckline is situated, is lost. This could lead to a “measured move to roughly [the] MA 200 area/$1.00 range.” Price Ready For 2026 Markup Phase? Despite the warnings, other market watchers shared a positive outlook for XRP in the coming months. Trader Niels affirmed that the leading altcoin is “looking good” at the current levels. According to the post, the cryptocurrency is “sweeping the $1.8 support zone again” while showing a bullish divergence on the daily timeframe, which suggests that the price could soon move to higher levels. To the trader, once XRP breaks above $2.20 resistance, it could surge 27%-37% towards the $2.80-$3.00 area “within a month.” Meanwhile, analyst ChartNerd highlighted that XRP appears to be repeating its 2023-2024 price action, which led to its massive breakout in November 2024. The chart shows that the altcoin accumulated for a year and a half, bouncing between the range’s lower and upper boundaries before its markup phase in late Q4 2024. Related Reading: XRP Hasn’t Entered A Bear Market Yet; Analyst Shares Why Following this expansion period, the cryptocurrency is showing a similar accumulation range, leading the analyst to suggest that XRP may continue consolidating within its current range before another markup phase occurs. “Regardless of scenarios, or how ugly/beautiful it gets, a massive markup phase similar to November 2024 is likely between now and late 2026,” he stated. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $1.92, a 1.65% increase in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",
