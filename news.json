    "title": "You Won’t Believe How Much Bitcoin Companies Now Hold, What % Of Supply Do They Control?",
    "body": "Bitocin treasury companies continue to accumulate a significant amount of BTC despite current market conditions and now control around 5% of the total BTC supply. These companies are led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Metaplanet, which have recently raised fresh capital to buy the dip. Bitcoin Treasury Companies Now Hold Over 1 Million In BTC Bitcoin Treasuries data shows that the top 100 public Bitcoin treasury companies currently hold 1,058,929 BTC, while all public companies combined hold 1,061,697. Notably, Strategy is the largest public Bitcoin holder with 650,000 BTC. Michael Saylor’s company yesterday announced another 130 BTC purchase for $11.7 million. Related Reading: Strategy’s Crash Rumors Intensify, CEO Reveals When $46 Billion In Bitcoin Will Be Sold Meanwhile, the second-largest Bitcoin treasury company is BTC miner MARA holdings, which holds 53,250 BTC. Tether-backed Twenty One Capital, Metaplanet, and Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company complete the top 5, with 43,514, 30,823, and 30,021 BTC, respectively. Meanwhile, companies like Coinbase, Bullish, and Trump Media are among the top 10 largest BTC treasury companies. It is worth noting that these public companies account for only a part of the Bitcoin treasuries. Further data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that there is currently 4 million BTC in treasuries as a whole, including the coins held by governments, private companies, exchanges, DeFi platforms, and ETFs. BlackRock is currently the second-largest Bitcoin holder, only behind Satoshi Nakamoto. Strategy is third on the list, while Binance and the U.S. government complete the top 5, with BTC holdings of 628,868 and 323,588, respectively. The 4 million BTC held by these treasury companies as a group accounts for 19% of the total Bitcoin supply. Bitcoin treasury companies such as Strategy and Metaplanet have raised new capital amid the recent crash to buy more BTC. Saylor’s company recently raised $836 million from its STRE offering, which it used to buy 8,178 BTC. Meanwhile, Metaplanet raised $130 million to expand its BTC treasury. More Companies Set To Adopt Bitcoin More Bitcoin treasury companies are set to emerge as $10 trillion asset manager, Vanguard, will start offering BTC ETFs from today. Notably, some companies gain BTC exposure through these ETFs rather than buying Bitcoin directly. On-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence revealed that the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan, holds $300 million worth of BlackRock’s BTC ETF. Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Price Action With Chinese Astrology Shares When Prices Will Surge Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that Bitcoin treasuries such as Strategy are coming under immense pressure amid the current market downtrend. Strategy’s CEO, Phong Le, admitted that they might have to sell Bitcoin as a last resort to fund dividend payments if their mNAV drops below 1x and they can no longer raise capital. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $87,000, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pngtree, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Vs. Gold Metric Flashes Rare Signal Not Seen in Market History – See How",
    "body": "A key long-term indicator comparing Bitcoin to gold has just triggered a signal not seen before in market history. Analysts say such extreme compression typically precedes violent directional moves, and the fact that it’s happening at the intersection of two global safe-haven assets makes the setup even more significant. With BTC outperforming gold for over a decade, this rare signal suggests that the next phase of the BTC vs Gold battle could rewrite long-term market expectations. What Happens After A Historic Squeeze? The Bitcoin versus Gold monthly Bollinger Bands are expanding from the tightest reading in history. A chartered market technician and Bitcoin trader, Tony “The Bull” Severino, revealed on X that the price is currently sitting at the lower Bollinger band, and a decisive close below will trigger a sell signal as the bands expand from a squeeze setup. Related Reading: Analyst’s Full Market Breakdown Shows Why Bitcoin Price Is Headed For $120,000 According to TonyTheBullCMT, this setup creates the potential for a significant trending-down move, which is the first major downtrend on the BTC against Gold chart. This might look the same against the USD, so don’t expect it to translate 1:1 there. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that Gold looks ready to overshadow BTC. If BTC is at % billion in the middle and falling into that lower greenish section, it won’t be a good sign for BTC in this ratio. The weekly Bollinger Bands on this pair were the tightest ever in history, and since they began to expand, BTC dropped over 25% in a couple of weeks. Meanwhile, the monthly signal is at least 4x stronger. Bitcoin has been in a brutal downtrend throughout the year. Crypto analyst Zynx has pointed out that BTC is now sitting almost 50% below its all-time high against Gold, and the ratio shows that the crypto king has effectively been in a bear market for an entire year of 2025. Over the last 12 months, BTC has been down 45% against Gold. At this point, it would need to rally 99% to surpass its previous all-time high against Gold, which shows that BTC must hit around $170,000 before it can begin to claim a true bull market. Bitcoin And Gold Ratio Hits A Statistical Low Rarely Reached Bitcoin has reached one of its rarest valuation points relative to gold in more than a decade. An analyst and founder of GREEND0TS, Stacy Muur, highlighted that the BTC/Gold ratio has just dropped below the statistical lower boundary of a 15-year power-law model. Related Reading: Can The Bitcoin Price Explode To $200,000? The Gold Chart That Tells It All Interestingly, BTC has breached this level only once before in late 2017 and snapped back within weeks. Historically, when BTC gets this incredibly cheap compared to Gold, it doesn’t stay cheap against Gold for long. This is not a timing signal; rather, it is a rare statistical anomaly worth watching.

    "title": "Bitcoin Long-Term Holders See First Uptick Since April Lows: Bullish Sign?",
    "body": "On-chain data shows that the Bitcoin investors with a holding time greater than six months have seen an upward reversal in their supply for the first time in months. Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply Has Just Turned Around As pointed out by Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards in a new post on X, the 6-month inactive supply has recently witnessed its first uptick since April. This part of the supply, covering tokens that have been dormant (that is, not involved in any transaction on the blockchain) since at least six months ago, belongs to investors popularly known as long-term holders (LTHs). Related Reading: XRP Crashes 9.5%, But TD Sequential Flashes A Buy Signal Statistically, the longer investors keep their coins dormant, the less likely they are to sell them in the future. As such, the LTH cohort with its relatively long holding time includes the resolute hands of the market. Despite their resilience, however, these investors have participated in selling during the past few months. Below is the chart shared by Edwards that shows the trend in the amount of supply dormant for longer than six months. As is visible in the graph, the drawdown in the Bitcoin LTH supply changed for the worse during the cryptocurrency’s crash last month, indicating that the diamond hands took part in a significant amount of distribution. Since this selloff, however, the decline in the metric appears to have paused, at least for now. There has even been a small increase in the indicator recently, a potential sign of a shift in investor behavior. Something to note is that while drops in the LTH supply can correspond to selling that’s occurring in the present, the same isn’t true in the case of an increase. An uptick in the metric isn’t a sign that members of the cohort are buying right now. Rather, it suggests some accumulation occurred six months ago, and now those coins have been held long enough to mature into the group. That said, the trend is naturally still a positive sign for Bitcoin, as it implies HODLing behavior could be becoming more dominant on the network. The last time such a shift occurred was around the time of the cryptocurrency’s lows back in April. Related Reading: Ethereum Speculators Add $654M In Bets As Price Plunges To $2,800 What followed that LTH supply rise was BTC’s rally to new all-time highs (ATHs). Considering this, it only remains to be seen whether the latest shift toward long-term holding will lead to anything similar, or if the cryptocurrency’s decline is here to stay this time around. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly slipped under $84,000 on Monday, but its price has since seen some recovery as it’s now back at $87,500.

    "title": "Ethereum Open Interest Cut In Half As $6.4B In Positions Vanish: Market Reset Accelerates",
    "body": "Ethereum has fallen below the $2,800 mark after a sharp and sudden decline, deepening panic across the market and reinforcing the sense that bulls have lost control. The recent drop has pushed investors into defensive mode, with some analysts now openly discussing the possibility of a broader bear market emerging. Selling pressure has intensified across spot and derivatives markets, and volatility continues to rise as traders struggle to identify a reliable support zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Largest Hidden-Buying Spike of the Cycle Despite Losing $90K Level A new CryptoQuant report by Darkfost highlights one of the most alarming developments: Ethereum’s open interest on Binance has been steadily collapsing for more than three months. After reaching an all-time high of $12.6 billion on August 22, open interest has now been cut in half. Nearly $6.4 billion in derivative positions have evaporated, bringing ETH’s open interest down to $6.2 billion, a steep 51% decline. While this appears to be an extraordinary contraction, Darkfost notes that open interest has only just slipped below the previous all-time high of $7.7 billion. This underscores how speculative and overstretched the 2025 derivatives market had become — and suggests that Ethereum may be undergoing a much deeper structural reset than most expected. Speculation Unwinds Across Exchanges as Ethereum Enters Deep Reset Phase Darkfost emphasizes that 2025 has been the most speculative phase in Ethereum’s history, fueled by aggressive leverage, rapid inflows, and a market structure that proved far less solid — and far less sustainable — than it appeared during the rally. The collapse in open interest on Binance is only part of the story. The same pattern is unfolding across major derivatives platforms, revealing a broader structural unwind rather than an exchange-specific phenomenon. On Gate.io, ETH open interest has fallen from $5.2 billion to $3.5 billion. On Bybit, the drop is even more severe, plunging from $6.1 billion to $2.3 billion. This synchronized contraction shows how aggressively speculative positions have been flushed out. Meanwhile, the ongoing correction has dragged Ethereum’s price from $4,830 to $2,800, marking a steep 43% decline from the highs. This widespread reduction in leverage suggests the market is undergoing a deeper reset than typical corrections. Investors are not rushing to re-enter positions, especially as liquidations continue to stack up across exchanges. While shrinking open interest weighs on short-term momentum and sentiment, Darkfost notes that such aggressive deleveraging may ultimately help rebuild a healthier market foundation — one capable of supporting a durable bottom for ETH. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Distribution Continues: Whale Sends Another 5,000 ETH To Binance ETH Loses Key Trend Support as 3-Day Structure Turns Fully Bearish Ethereum’s 3-day chart shows a decisive breakdown in structure, with price now firmly below the 50 SMA, 100 SMA, and 200 SMA for the first time since late 2024. The rejection from the $3,600–$3,800 region triggered a strong impulse to the downside, sending ETH directly through all major moving averages and confirming a shift toward a higher-timeframe downtrend. The current trading zone around $2,800 reflects a critical test of former support, but momentum remains weak. The 50 SMA has now crossed below the 100 SMA, while both are beginning to converge downward toward the 200 SMA — a configuration that typically precedes sustained corrections. Volume has increased on red candles, showing that sellers remain dominant, and there is little evidence of aggressive dip-buying. The most recent candle wick toward $2,700 highlights vulnerability rather than strength, suggesting buyers are hesitant to defend this level with conviction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Break Key Supply Clusters To Regain ATH Momentum – Watch These Levels ETH is also forming a series of lower highs and lower lows, further confirming bearish market structure. If $2,750 breaks cleanly, the next significant liquidity zones sit near $2,550 and $2,300, where prior consolidations developed earlier in the cycle.

    "body": "Authorities in Europe have shut down a large crypto mixing service and seized a major amount of Bitcoin, according to law enforcement statements and media reports. The operation took down a key domain, seized servers, and captured $29 million in Bitcoin that investigators say was tied to illicit flows. Related Reading: XRP Is About To Hit A Major Turning Point This Week, Analyst Says Europol And Swiss Authorities Act Based on reports, a joint action by Europol, Swiss, and German authorities took place between November 24 and November 28, 2025. During the operation, three servers located in Switzerland were seized, the domain Cryptomixer.io was disabled, and investigators recovered about 12 terabytes of data. According to officials, the service had been used since 2016 and is linked to roughly €1.3 billion in laundered Bitcoin over that time. The cash figure seized in the takedown was reported at close to $30 million in Bitcoin. How The Service Worked Reports have disclosed that the site operated as a hybrid mixer. That means it accepted funds on the regular web and used techniques to pool, jumble, and redistribute coins so the origin of funds became hard to trace. Criminals allegedly used the service to hide proceeds from activities such as drug sales, ransomware attacks, and fraud, according to investigators. By randomizing amounts and delaying payouts, mixers like this make the usual tracking tools much less effective. What The Seized Data Could Reveal Law enforcement officers say the 12 terabytes of material may hold leads that point to other illegal transfers and the people behind them. The data is now being examined, and it could make it easier to trace how money moved through the service. It is not yet clear whether arrests have been made. Experts warn that even with seized material, tracing every tainted coin will be difficult because of how mixing services scramble transaction records. Related Reading: ‘Saylor Is Finished’ – Peter Schiff Slams Bitcoin Tycoon Over $1.44B Reserve Build-Up Wider Impact On Crypto Crime Investigators argue the takedown is a major blow against online money laundering in Europe. Based on reports, crypto mixers of this size helped mask hundreds of millions, and in some cases billions, of dollars over years. The removal of one large service may slow some criminal flows, but analysts caution that operators and users can migrate to other services or new tools. Criminals often adapt quickly, which means the broader problem may continue unless follow-up actions and legal steps are taken. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Liquidation Dominance Hits Multi-Year High: The Real Cause Behind BTC’s Breakdown",
    "body": "Bitcoin continues to trade below $90,000, struggling to recover after several days of heavy selling and aggressive long liquidations. Sellers keep pushing price lower, and bulls fail to reclaim momentum, creating a market environment filled with uncertainty and fear. Every attempt to bounce meets immediate resistance, showing how much control bears currently hold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Largest Hidden-Buying Spike of the Cycle Despite Losing $90K Level Data shared by Axel Adler shows a clear shift in derivatives pressure toward buyers. The liquidation dominance oscillator now sits at 32%, one of its highest readings in recent years. This level signals that leveraged bulls keep taking the majority of the damage, with long positions consistently wiped out as volatility rises. Instead of absorbing the drawdown, many traders continue to unwind or get forced out of their positions. These repeated long liquidations fuel deeper downside moves and block any meaningful recovery attempts. The market now watches closely to see whether this wave of forced selling will continue dragging Bitcoin lower or if the pressure is finally reaching exhaustion. Long Liquidations Dominate as Bitcoin Faces Renewed Downside Pressure Adler explains that the liquidation dominance oscillator measures the ratio between long and short liquidations across the derivatives market. When the indicator prints positive values, shown as green bars, long positions take the bulk of the damage. Negative values reflect a dominance of short liquidations. Bitcoin’s current reading of 32% stands out as one of the highest levels seen in the last three years, highlighting how aggressively bulls have been forced out during this correction. November illustrates this perfectly. The market saw three separate waves of long liquidations, each exceeding $400 million. Every one of those spikes aligned with a sharp acceleration in Bitcoin’s price decline, reinforcing how leveraged buyers repeatedly amplified downside momentum. Rather than stabilizing the market, each flush created more selling pressure and triggered deeper unwinding across futures platforms. The most recent liquidation wave reached $221 million, hitting the market right as Bitcoin attempted a short-term recovery. That flush immediately reversed the bounce and dragged BTC back down to the $86,000 region, erasing nearly all of last week’s gains. The persistent dominance of long liquidations shows that bulls remain under heavy stress—and until this dynamic eases, Bitcoin will struggle to build sustainable upside. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Distribution Continues: Whale Sends Another 5,000 ETH To Binance Bitcoin Market Searches for a Higher Time-Frame Floor Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows the market pressing into a critical support zone after weeks of heavy selling. The price has dropped from the $115,000 region to the $86,000–$88,000 range, where it now interacts directly with the 100 SMA. This moving average has served as a key structural support in previous cycles, and Bitcoin’s current test of it will likely determine whether the broader uptrend holds or breaks down further. The recent candles highlight intense volatility. Bitcoin briefly dipped to nearly $84,000 before buyers stepped in, forming a lower wick that shows early attempts to defend this level. However, the rebound remains shallow, and the 50 SMA continues to slope downward — a sign that short- and mid-term momentum still favors sellers. For bulls to regain control, BTC needs to reclaim $95,000 on a weekly closing basis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Break Key Supply Clusters To Regain ATH Momentum – Watch These Levels Volume adds weight to the bearish pressure. Selling spikes dominate recent weeks, revealing a mix of forced liquidations and fear-driven exits rather than healthy profit-taking. As long as BTC trades below the 50 SMA, the market remains vulnerable to deeper retracements. If the 100 SMA fails to hold, the next major liquidity zone sits near $70,000–$72,000, aligning with previous consolidation and the long-term 200 SMA. The next weekly close will be decisive.

    "body": "XRP price started a recovery wave from $1.9840. The price is now rising above $2.120 and might face hurdles near the $2.250 pivot level. XRP price started a recovery wave from the $1.9840 zone. The price is now trading above $2.120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2.150 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above $2.250. XRP Price Recovers Over 5% XRP price extended losses below the $2.050 support, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price even spiked below $2.00 before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $1.9844, and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above the $2.050 and $2.120 levels. The bulls were able to push the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.2750 swing high to the $1.9844 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2.150 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.20 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.2750 swing high to the $1.9844 low. The first major resistance is near the $2.250 level. A close above $2.250 could send the price to $2.320. The next hurdle sits at $2.350. A clear move above the $2.350 resistance might send the price toward the $2.40 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.450 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.50. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.250 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.120 level. The next major support is near the $2.10 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.10 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.050. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.920. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.120 and $2.10. Major Resistance Levels – $2.20 and $2.250.",

    "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price In A ‘Vulnerable Technical Environment’ – Key Levels To Watch",
    "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) began the week dropping nearly 10% from the recent highs and retesting the $84,000 area before bouncing. As price risks more downside with early bear market signals, a market observer suggested that the upcoming weeks will be crucial for BTC’s future path. Related Reading: Zcash (ZEC) Leads Market Pullback With 24% Drop, Analysts Warn Of Another Crash Ahead Bitcoin Holds Key Weekly Range Last week, Bitcoin led the brief market recovery, surging from its seven-month low of $80,600 toward the $93,000 area, retesting a key weekly re-accumulation range between these two levels. However, the Sunday correction sent the price back to the range lows, raising concerns about the flagship crypto’s short-term future. Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that BTC is stabilizing within its weekly range, holding its position above the $82,000 range low. This area marks the top of an early 2025 liquidity cluster that developed around the 50-Week EMA, where the price has tapped with three downside wicks over the past month. “Last week’s Weekly Close above the Range Low enabled a relief move toward $93,500,” the analyst explained, “but that level acted as clean resistance,” after Friday’s rejection. To the analyst, maintaining stability around the weekly range lows is important because further downside wicking into the cluster is probable. However, he noted that the consolidation structure remains intact as long as BTC’s price continues to hold above the range low in the weekly timeframe. Rekt Capital added that Bitcoin continues to trade below a sharply declining Macro Downtrend that “has been dictating resistance throughout this phase of the cycle.” Per the analysis, “A breakout soon would require reclaiming higher price levels, whereas a later attempt would meet the trendline at lower valuations, narrowing the distance between the current price and resistance.” “In either case, the Macro Downtrend remains the dominant structural barrier, and Bitcoin’s path forward depends on whether consolidation near the Weekly Range Low can bring price closer to a meaningful test of this sharply descending level,” he continued. BTC’s Vulnerable Technical Environment Raises Alarms Rekt Capital also highlighted that BTC remains below the 21-Week EMA and 50-Week EMA, which could pose a problem for its future price action as the distance between these moving averages continues to narrow. As he detailed, when these EMAs compress and ultimately cross, it tends to precede further downside. Although it usually takes weeks after the crossover for price acceleration to “fully unfold,” it still implies that the crossover risk is increasing. The two EMAs currently represent potential resistance levels on future relief attempts, with the 50-Week EMA retest “leaving room for a future rejection if price revisits it.” Related Reading: Revisiting $85,000: Bitcoin Price Drop Linked To Japanese Government Bonds This position, the analyst explained, places BTC in a “vulnerable technical environment” as “the convergence of the EMAs toward the Macro Downtrend creates a layered zone of resistance that will be difficult to overcome unless price can reclaim one of these moving averages and stabilise above it.” Until Bitcoin successfully turns one of the EMAs into support, “the structure resembles the early-stage clustering seen in prior cycles where EMAs compressed before a broader bearish continuation,” the analyst concluded. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $88,294, a 2.3% increase in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Slump Claims New Victims: Leveraged ETFs Tied To Strategy Suffer Major Losses",
    "body": "Despite a 9% recovery on Tuesday, Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced considerable volatility, with its price plummeting to as low as $84,000 just 24 hours ago. This downturn has had a significant impact on Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) the public company that holds the largest BTC reserves, currently boasting over 650,000 coins. Strategy T-Rex ETFs Plummet Nearly 85% NewsBTC reported that the company’s CEO, Phong Le, suggested the possibility of selling some of their Bitcoin holdings in light of the current market conditions. Alongside this, the company’s leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also faced substantial losses, intensifying worries about Strategy’s financial health. Reuters highlighted that Strategy’s leveraged ETFs, which are designed to magnify returns on the firm’s stock, have been among the largest casualties of this year’s cryptocurrency slump. Related Reading: You Won’t Believe How Much Bitcoin Companies Now Hold, What % Of Supply Do They Control? Two specific ETFs, the T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF and the Defiance Daily Target 2x Long MSTR ETF, have seen dramatic declines, losing nearly 85% of their value this year. Additionally, the T-Rex 2X Inverse MSTR Daily Target ETF has dropped by 48% in the same time frame. In this environment, shares of Strategy, MSTR, have fallen more than 40% this year, driven primarily by Bitcoin’s price crash. Investor attention is now focused on Strategy’s “mNAV” (market net asset value) metric, which compares the company’s enterprise value to its Bitcoin holdings. Following Le’s comments, where he mentioned the firm might consider selling cryptocurrencies if the mNAV drops below 1, concerns grew about the firm’s long-term outlook. Current estimates place this ratio around 1.1, according to calculations by Reuters. Analysts Remain Optimistic Mike O’Rourke, the chief market strategist at JonesTrading, noted that Le’s remarks diminish the company’s message of steadfastness in holding Bitcoin, even amid market volatility. The company has also revised its full-year outlook, warning of a potential profit ranging from $6.3 billion to a loss of $5.5 billion, a stark adjustment from its earlier forecast of $24 billion in net profit. This prior estimate, made on October 30, anticipated Bitcoin reaching $150,000 by year-end. Commenting on the shifting strategies within the firm, Vincenzo Vedda, chief investment officer at DWS, remarked, “Great strategy from Strategy, while prices go up. When they go down, well, the strategic options left to the company are limited.” Related Reading: Here’s What To Expect If The XRP Price Holds $2 Since entering the Nasdaq 100 index, Strategy’s shares have dropped more than 70% from their peak in November 2024, more than halving in value over the year. Despite this dismal performance, analyst sentiments remain relatively optimistic; of the 16 brokerages monitoring Strategy, 10 recommend it as a “buy” while four suggest a “strong buy,” with an overall median price target of $485, reflecting a potential 183% increase over the next year based on LSEG data. When writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, managed to recover the $92,000 line. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Cardano’s December Slide Intensifies: What’s Driving the Decline and What Comes Next?",
    "body": "Cardano (ADA) has opened December under pressure, dropping more than 7% in the past week as broader market sentiment weakens and macroeconomic uncertainty rises. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders See First Uptick Since April Lows: Bullish Sign? ADA is now trading near $0.38–$0.4, testing key support levels and extending a month-long downtrend that has erased recent gains. ADA's price gains some small gains on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Macroeconomic Pressure and Market Sentiment Weigh on ADA The latest decline comes amid renewed concerns over global interest rate policy. Comments from Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda signaled the possibility of a rate hike, a shift that could unwind leveraged positions funded through low-interest yen borrowing. Cardano’s drop aligns with losses seen across the crypto market, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major altcoins also trading lower. High trading volumes, over $1 billion in the past 24 hours, reflect elevated volatility and growing caution among investors. On-chain indicators show dormant ADA wallets from as far back as 2017 moving coins to exchanges, a sign that long-term holders may be preparing to exit positions. Short interest in ADA futures has also increased, with open interest rising 12% over the past week. Traders are betting on a further slide below $0.35 unless ADA can reclaim the $0.40 resistance level. Ecosystem Developments Offer Some Long-Term Support Despite the market downturn, several developments within the Cardano ecosystem continue to generate attention. A $30 million liquidity initiative designed to strengthen Cardano’s DeFi sector is scheduled for rollout in early 2026. The fund aims to boost total value locked by supporting lending, staking, and decentralized exchange activity, areas where Cardano has historically lagged behind competitors. Another upcoming milestone is the launch of the Midnight sidechain on December 8. The privacy-focused network introduces new capabilities around data protection and secure enterprise applications. Some analysts believe the launch could increase Cardano’s adoption and improve sentiment, particularly if it leads to more activity in decentralized finance. Cardano’s long-term technical outlook also remains a topic of debate. Analysts note that ADA is once again touching the support line of a multi-year uptrend. Historically, similar tests have preceded recoveries, with some projecting a possible rebound toward the $0.50–$0.75 range if the market stabilizes. What Comes Next for Cardano (ADA)? The near-term outlook for Cardano remains uncertain. A break below $0.38 could expose the token to further declines toward the $0.30 area, especially if broader market weakness continues. However, strong staking participation, around 70% of circulating supply, may help cushion deeper drawdowns. Longer-term forecasts vary widely, ranging from modest recoveries to highly optimistic projections tied to expected ecosystem upgrades in 2026. Related Reading: Bitcoin Vs.

    "body": "Bitcoin has turned itself around with a sharp surge to $92,000, unleashing a fresh wave of short liquidations on the derivatives exchanges. Bitcoin Has Seen A Flash Recovery Back To $92,000 Bitcoin suffered a blow on Monday as its price slipped under $84,000, but just as quickly as it had crashed, the cryptocurrency has made a swift recovery on Tuesday. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders See First Uptick Since April Lows: Bullish Sign? With the asset’s price now floating above $92,000, its price has surged by more than 8% over the last 24 hours. Like is usually the case, Bitcoin hasn’t been alone in this rally; the rest of the cryptocurrency market has also shot up alongside the number one digital asset. Some of the top altcoins have even managed to outperform BTC, with Ethereum (ETH) sitting in a profit of nearly 10% for the past day. The fresh wave of volatility in the sector has triggered a liquidation squeeze in the derivatives market. Crypto Liquidations Have Crossed $400 Million In Last 24 Hours According to data from CoinGlass, the cryptocurrency market as a whole has suffered over $410 million in liquidations during the past day. “Liquidation” here naturally refers to the forceful closure that any contract undergoes after it has amassed a certain percentage of loss (as defined by the platform). Considering that the price action in this window was majorly to the upside, it’s not surprising to see that short contracts made up for most of the derivatives flush. As is visible in the above table, $348 million in short positions found liquidation in the last 24 hours, equivalent to about 85% of the total flush. In terms of the individual symbols, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana were the top three contributors to the liquidation event with $196 million, $95 million, and $18 million in positions, respectively. Just $13 million of the Bitcoin liquidations involved long investors; the rest $182 million in liquidations struck the traders betting on a bearish outcome for the cryptocurrency. A mass liquidation event like this latest one is popularly known as a squeeze. Today’s squeeze involved shorts in an extreme majority, so the event will be termed a short squeeze. During a squeeze, a sharp swing in the price triggers a large derivatives flush, which only ends up feeding back into the price move. The amplified price swing then unleashes a further cascade of liquidations.

    "body": "Bitcoin jumped back above key levels on Wednesday, with prices climbing past $93,000 after dipping to $84,400 earlier this month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trail Ends: $29M Seized After European Authorities Shut Down Cryptomixer The move followed a sharp sell-off that removed about $8,000 from the price late over the weekend, and traders pushed the coin to a 24-hour peak of $93,910 on Coingecko. Bitcoin Climbs Above Key Levels According to MN Fund founder Michaël van de Poppe, regaining ground above $93,000 is important for momentum. He said that if the price holds and breaks higher, a run toward $100,000 becomes more likely. Other analysts echoed the call: Nick Ruck of LVRG Research pointed to macro factors and fresh ETF flows as drivers that could help Bitcoin test six figures in the coming months. This is what you’d want to see. $BTC coming back up again, after a weird move down on the 1st of this month. Now, again, breaking the $92K area is crucial. If that breaks, then I’m sure we’ll start to see a new all-time high and a test at $100K. A great day on the markets. pic.twitter.com/uy6WPabnQ8 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 2, 2025 ETF Activity And Market Moves Reports have disclosed that ETF-related trading helped lift the market. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded over $1.8 billion in volume within two hours after Vanguard reversed a previous stance, and total spot Bitcoin ETF volume topped $5.1 billion on the day. Market stats showed the broader crypto capitalization rose close to 7% to $3.13 trillion, with BTC dominance climbing to nearly 60%. Bitcoin itself jumped by about 8% after the US market opened, giving larger markets a clear lift. Support Zone Holds Focus Analysts had been watching the $86,000 to $88,000 band as a critical area of support. Based on reports from active market watchers, that range had been tested dozens of times in recent months and holding above it signaled reduced selling pressure. One analyst argued that a break below would likely lead some big players to change tack, moving from buying to selling behavior. Liquidations And Net Inflows Changed The Day Other market observers reported heavy turnover in derivatives and spot markets: over $360 billion in short positions were liquidated, while more than $160 billion was reportedly added back into crypto markets within a 24-hour span. Those figures, if accurate, helped explain the speed of the rebound and the large single-day gains. Related Reading: XRP Is About To Hit A Major Turning Point This Week, Analyst Says What Comes Next For Prices Short-term traders will watch how Bitcoin behaves around $92,000 and whether it can hold above the $86,000–$88,000 floor. Some commentators warned that sudden ETF-driven demand can cause sharp spikes that may not last. Others pointed to possible policy shifts, such as renewed talk of US interest-rate cuts, as reasons why money might flow into major crypto assets in the months ahead. For now, prices sit a little above $92,700 at the time of writing. The market is clearly volatile. Investors and traders will likely need to balance the bullish signs against the risk that a fresh round of selling could wipe gains quickly. Featured image from Gemini, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Best Crypto to Buy as Kevin Hassett Takes Fed Chair and Loosens Policy Fueling $BTC",
    "body": "What to Know: A more dovish, crypto-friendly Fed chair like Kevin Hassett could extend a multi‑year liquidity cycle, favoring Bitcoin and high‑beta altcoins. Position sizing, diversification, and risk management remain critical, even when macro conditions and narratives seem heavily tilted in crypto’s favor. Bitcoin Hyper’s SVM-powered Layer 2 aims to unlock low-latency smart contracts and DeFi around $BTC while preserving Bitcoin settlement security. PEPENODE and Dogwifhat provide meme and community-driven upside exposure if easier policy reignites speculative flows into Solana and broader alt markets. Speculation that Kevin Hassett could take over the Fed with a more dovish, pro-risk stance is exactly the kind of macro shift crypto loves. Trump has made repeated references to Hassett , so it wouldn’t come as a surprise. A chair who’s comfortable with deeper rate cuts and friendlier optics toward digital assets doesn’t just move markets for a quarter; it reshapes liquidity conditions for years. Cheaper money and clearer political cover for Bitcoin would likely mean a stronger bid for $BTC first, then a spillover into high-beta altcoins and infrastructure plays. If that happens, you want exposure to assets that benefit structurally from a multi‑year adoption wave. That’s where Bitcoin-focused scaling, speculative meme liquidity, and Solana ecosystem bets start to matter, making them the best crypto to buy . You’re not just guessing charts; you’re aligning with where capital, developers, and users could cluster if 2026–2028 turns into another extended risk cycle. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , and Dogwifhat ($WIF) , although all different, are potentially geared to thrive if a Hassett-led Fed extends easy policy and pushes fresh capital back into crypto. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Bitcoin Layer 2 Bringing Bitcoin Security With SVM Speed If looser Fed policy sends Bitcoin back into price discovery, the next big bottleneck won’t be demand for $BTC, it’ll be what you can do with it. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) positions itself as a Bitcoin Layer 2 with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, aiming to turn dormant $BTC into fully programmable capital. Instead of trying to bolt slow EVM logic onto Bitcoin, $HYPER uses a modular design: Bitcoin L1 for settlement and a real-time SVM-powered L2 for execution. That architecture targets sub-second finality and low fees while anchoring state periodically to Bitcoin, giving builders Solana-style speed with Bitcoin-grade trust assumptions. The project leans on a single trusted sequencer, with periodic L1 state anchoring, and supports SPL-compatible tokens customized for its Layer 2. That opens the door to Solana-like DeFi, swaps, lending, and staking protocols but with wrapped $BTC as a first-class asset, plus Rust SDKs and APIs for gaming dApps and NFT platforms. From a capital-rotation lens, the numbers are already notable. The $HYPER presale has raised over $28.8M with tokens currently at $0.013365, showing a clear appetite from investors looking ahead of any macro pivot. Our experts see future potential as well, with an end-of-2026 price prediction hitting $0.08625. That’d see you with a potential ROI of over 545% if you invested at today’s price. If you get in early, you can also take advantage of dynamic staking rewards, currently sitting at 40%. Being a $HYPER holder, you also get rewards tied to community and governance participation. If you believe a Hassett-led Fed kickstarts a new liquidity cycle centered on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Hyper is a direct bet on scaling that demand. Join the $HYPER presale today. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): Mine-to-Earn Without the Overheads Every easy-money cycle has a meme phase, and if the Fed turns dovish again, you can expect speculative capital to chase narratives that blend culture, game mechanics, and upside. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE ) leans into that with a mine‑to‑earn meme coin pitch, trying to gamify yield and engagement rather than just relying on vibes. Instead of just traditional staking, PEPENODE uses a Virtual Mining System and tiered node rewards to simulate mining economics in a meme wrapper. You effectively run virtual nodes through a gamified dashboard, competing for higher reward tiers and social status. This isn’t only fun, but it can help keep community participation high during volatile markets. Learn how to buy PEPENODE. The $PEPENODE presale has already gained traction, having raised over $2.2M with tokens currently priced at $0.0011778. This puts it firmly in low-cap, high-optional-value territory if meme risk-on returns. And with staking rewards as high as 576% there’s even more incentive to opt-in. That blend of narrative and gameified mechanics gives it a different profile from pure hype coins that rely solely on social media. As a bonus, you can even earn rewards in other popular coins like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN. If dovish policy stokes another wave of speculative flows, $PEPENODE is a way to express that trade in a structured, mine‑to‑earn format rather than a raw punt. Don’t miss the mine and get your $PEPENODE today. 3. Dogwifhat ($WIF): Solana Meme Beta for a Liquidity Wave Any discussion of meme beta in this cycle has to include Dogwifhat ($WIF) , the Solana-based meme coin that’s become a proxy for retail risk appetite. Built on Solana, $WIF benefits from low fees and high throughput, helping speculative traders rotate in and out quickly without the friction you see on slower chains. Recent market action underlines that reflexivity. $WIF rallied over 20% in a single seven‑day stretch, reclaiming momentum among Solana meme coins. It currently sits around rank #109 by market cap, with strong trading activity and recurring bursts of retail attention. Beyond price, $WIF has a sticky community that treats it as a cultural asset, not just a ticker. In a macro regime where the Fed signals friendlier policy, that kind of community‑driven liquidity can compound quickly as traders hunt for leverage to a Solana-led alt season. If you expect a Hasset Fed to extend the runway for high‑beta risk, Dogwifhat ($WIF) is a straightforward way to capture Solana meme exposure without betting on unproven microcaps. It sits at the intersection of chain narrative, cheap blockspace, and viral culture. Buy $WIF on top exchanges like Binance. Recap: If Kevin Hassett ushers in a looser Fed, Bitcoin Hyper , PEPENODE , and Dogwifhat each offer distinct ways to ride that liquidity wave. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

This signals returning risk appetite, bolstering the case for curated presale exposure. Bitcoin Hyper brings SVM execution and extremely low-latency processing to a Bitcoin Layer 2, targeting wrapped $BTC payments, DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Maxi Doge and Pumpd offer higher‑beta meme exposure, the former around leverage‑trader culture, the latter around automated burns and AI market tooling. Altcoin risk appetite is quietly returning. Coinbase’s latest roadmap additions and Bithumb’s fresh KRW pairs show that big, regulated venues are finally widening the funnel again, just as spot volumes and stablecoin float start to recover from 2024’s drawdown. When top-tier exchanges expand listings to improve liquidity, it’s usually not about chasing memes; it’s about preparing inventory for the next rotation. Historically, periods like this have front‑run broad alt seasons as sidelined capital migrates from $BTC and stablecoins into higher‑beta narratives. You’re also seeing a structural shift under the surface. Stablecoin market caps are ticking higher , basis trades are back on, and derivatives funding is no longer screaming fear. That combination tends to favor early‑stage bets: investors look for presales that marry strong narratives with credible tech and clear token utility. Against that backdrop, three of the best crypto presales stand out across very different corners of the market: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) as a high‑throughput Bitcoin Layer 2, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) as a hyper‑speculative trading culture play, and Pumpd ($PUMPD) as an experiment in algorithmic meme tokenomics and AI tooling. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): The High-Performance Layer 2 for the Bitcoin Economy Bitcoin established the foundation of digital finance as the ultimate store of value. But to power the next generation of Web3, the network needs speed and utility without sacrificing security. Introducing Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a revolutionary Layer 2 scaling solution engineered to take Bitcoin further. Bitcoin Hyper differentiates itself by integrating the high-performance Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) directly atop Bitcoin’s security anchor. This unique architecture leverages the SVM’s parallel processing capabilities to deliver sub-second finality and negligible gas fees, making high-frequency trading and complex DeFi finally viable on Bitcoin. Furthermore, onboarding assets is secure and seamless via its robust canonical bridge. This trust-minimized gateway ensures that native $BTC can be safely ported onto the Bitcoin Hyper network without relying on centralized intermediaries. Want a bit more project info? We’ve got you covered in our ‘ What is Bitcoin Hyper ’ guide. The native $HYPER token fuels this rapidly expanding ecosystem, serving as the essential currency for network transaction fees and decentralized governance. Bitcoin Hyper isn’t just faster money; it is the sophisticated infrastructure needed for a decentralized future built on the bedrock of Bitcoin. $HYPER’s already flying high, having raised over $28.8M in its presale. It currently offers you 40% staking rewards, and there have been some hefty whale purchases, one of $500K , showing that smart money sees it as a viable play. Buy your $HYPER today for $0.013365. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Meme Token for Leverage Degens Maxi Doge ($MAXI) leans unapologetically into the leverage culture that still defines much of crypto trading. Branded as a 240‑lb canine juggernaut, it’s less about utility primitives and more about capturing the 1000x mentality through community competition, and the ‘never skip leg-day, never skip a pump’ attitude. The core pitch is ‘Leverage King Culture’: a meme asset that personifies the high‑risk, high‑reward ethos of perpetual traders while avoiding actual 1000x leverage on platforms that blow up accounts. Holder‑only trading competitions, performance leaderboards, and reward campaigns in the future will turn speculative behavior itself into content and community glue. Already sold on the vibe? Check out our ‘ How to Buy Maxi Doge ’ guide to see how to get in on the action. On the numbers side, the Maxi Doge presale has raised over $4.2M so far, with tokens currently at $0.000271. That’s a meaningful war chest for marketing, liquidity provisioning, and partnerships through its Maxi Fund treasury, which is earmarked to support listings and ecosystem collaborations as conditions improve. Staking comes with a dynamic APY model currently offering 72% rewards, which can flex based on treasury performance and market conditions. If you believe meme liquidity roars back whenever alt seasons kick off, Maxi Doge offers a focused bet on that behavior. Buy Maxi Doge in its presale now. 3. Pumpd ($PUMPD): Daily-Pump Meme Coin With AI Trading Tools Pumpd ($PUMPD) pushes meme tokenomics into more programmatic territory. It’s a meme‑driven project whose smart contract encodes daily price increase mechanics, an automated burn schedule tied to market triggers, and AI‑powered analytics tools designed to help holders trade more intelligently across the broader market. The token includes a ‘daily pump’ parameter baked into the contract, effectively engineering a persistent upward bias in the quoted presale price while supply gets reduced via automatic burns. Those burns are triggered by specific market conditions, removing tokens from circulation without relying on manual team actions or discretionary treasury moves. On top of that, Pumpd is building AI systems that scan markets, whale wallets, and social sentiment for trading signals, with the goal of turning raw volatility into structured alerts and dashboards for the community. It’s still firmly a meme coin, but one that tries to justify attention with data‑driven tools rather than vibes alone. The project remains in an active presale phase, with guaranteed daily price steps and a growing set of launchpad and AI integrations. As an emerging meme play with a more advanced technical stack, Pumpd fits investors who want speculative upside plus a narrative around automation and on‑chain intelligence rather than pure branding. Get your $PUMPD for $0.000412. Recap: With big exchanges expanding altcoin listings into a recovering liquidity backdrop, the best crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper , Maxi Doge , and Pumpd offer very different ways to position for the next cycle. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

    "title": "Are Dogecoin Whales Leaving The Meme Coin? Large Transactions Crash To 2-Month Lows",
    "body": "Dogecoin’s recent price action has taken an unexpected turn as on-chain data shows whale transactions collapsing to levels not seen in two months. This lack of activity from whale addresses has seen the meme coin falling to an important support area, and it raises the question about whether big players are stepping back from the meme coin. Dogecoin Whale Activity Falls To Its Lowest Level In 60 Days Data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment reveals that large transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain recently fell to as low as just 4 in a single day, marking a two-month low in whale participation. Santiment classifies whale transaction count as transactions with a value of $1 million or greater. This drop is notable, as it is a drastic change from the high levels of participation of whale traders in October and early November, which reached as high as 212 whale transactions on October 11. Related Reading: Here’s What To Expect If The XRP Price Holds $2 This drop is an extension of a steady Dogecoin cooldown that has persisted through the past few weeks. Large-holder activity can serve as a proxy for institutional or high-volume investors. Therefore, the current decline suggests that big players are either waiting for better entry conditions or scaling back exposure. At the time of writing, Santiment data shows that there were 11 Dogecoin whale transactions in the past 24 hours. Although this is a rebound from the alarming four-transaction low, the current level is far below what is considered a healthy range for a cryptocurrency that relies heavily on sentiment bursts of activity. The reduction in transfers is especially notable at a time when Dogecoin’s price action in the past 24 hours is attempting to maintain an important level above $0.15. Dogecoin Whale Transaction Count. Source: Santiment DOGE Holds Support, But Technical Momentum Weakens Price action in the past few weeks has been mostly bearish price action, and technical analysis shows that the meme coin is now in its longest accumulation phase since its inception. Related Reading: Ripple Marks Another Milestone In Bid To Dominate Global Payments With XRP Dogecoin Price Accumulation. Source: @galaxyBTC On X Notably, Dogecoin is going through a spark of strength over the past 24 hours as it bounced from $0.134 and climbed about 11%, but the recovery appears to be generated by retail traders rather than a meaningful return of whale activity. That estimation aligns with the weak inflows into Spot Dogecoin ETFs and the overall quietness from major holders. It is difficult for the price to build a strong upward trend without whales participating on the buy side. It’s not just the presence of whales that matters, but the nature of their activity. Earlier in the year, on October 11, whale transactions surged to 212, but most of those were sell orders. The result was immediate and painful, as the Dogecoin price dropped from $0.25 to $0.18 in a single day. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Wall Street FOMO Over Vanguard’s Bitcoin ETF Pivot: $HYPER Rides the Wave",
    "body": "What to Know: Vanguard’s embrace of spot Bitcoin ETFs adds another giant gatekeeper to the BTC on-ramp, channeling retirement and retail capital into the asset. As Bitcoin becomes an ETF-friendly macro asset, traders seeking more upside are rotating toward higher-risk ecosystem plays and infrastructure tokens. Bitcoin Hyper targets Bitcoin’s limitations on speed, fees, and programmability by integrating SVM on a modular Layer 2 anchored to $BTC settlement. The Bitcoin Layer 2 race is intensifying as projects compete to capture DeFi, gaming, and payments flows that the base Bitcoin network cannot natively support. For years, Vanguard stood out as the big asset manager that wanted nothing to do with spot Bitcoin ETFs. That stance quietly shifted , and the pivot matters. When a $9+ trillion retirement giant opens the door to $BTC exposure, it adds another massive gatekeeper to the on-ramp for mainstream capital. It saw $BTC rally on Tuesday, jumping back up to the $92K mark from a recent dip below the $86K region. You now have BlackRock, Fidelity, and Vanguard funneling retirement portfolios, 401(k)s, and brokerage accounts into spot Bitcoin. That flow doesn’t just push up $BTC’s market cap; it changes how traditional investors think about crypto risk. Bitcoin starts to look like ‘digital gold core holding,’ not a speculative side bet. The knock-on effect is obvious for traders: if Bitcoin becomes the safe, ETF-wrapped asset, the search for higher-octane upside moves further out on the risk curve. That’s where ecosystem plays, infrastructure tokens, and early-stage presales come in. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself exactly in that lane, pitching itself as a Bitcoin-native Layer 2 with Solana-grade performance. As capital crowds into spot BTC via TradFi rails, the question for more aggressive crypto traders isn’t ‘Should I own Bitcoin?’ anymore. It’s ‘Where can I get leveraged exposure to the Bitcoin network’s growth without using actual leverage?’ For some, that answer increasingly looks like ecosystem bets such as Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) and other high-throughput Bitcoin Layer 2s. Why Wall Street’s Bitcoin Obsession Pushes Attention To Layer 2 Wall Street’s ETF embrace solves one thing: easy Bitcoin exposure inside familiar accounts. It doesn’t solve Bitcoin’s technical pain points. The base layer still processes roughly 7 transactions per second , with confirmation times measured in minutes and fees that spike into double digits when mempools clog. That limitation is a feature for store-of-value purists, but a brick wall for anyone wanting DeFi, gaming, or consumer apps atop Bitcoin. So you’re seeing a rush of infrastructure projects racing to bolt smart contracts and high throughput onto $BTC without compromising its settlement assurances. Competing visions include Ordinals-centric tooling, sidechains like Rootstock, and experimental rollup frameworks. In that crowded field, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is pitching itself as a unique contender, differentiating through Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) compatibility. It has an explicit focus on traders and DeFi power users looking to amplify Bitcoin’s upside rather than just hold ETF shares. You can buy $HYPER for $0.013365 while it’s still in its presale, and take advantage of 40% staking rewards. Bitcoin Hyper’s Bet: Solana Performance, Bitcoin Settlement Zooming in, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) markets itself as ‘the first ever Bitcoin Layer 2 with SVM integration,’ aiming to deliver performance that can exceed Solana’s own execution speeds. Anchored by a canonical bridge that links Bitcoin’s security to high-speed execution, Bitcoin Hyper’s modular architecture combines the best of both worlds. The system relies on Bitcoin L1 for settlement while offloading processing to a real-time SVM Layer 2, where a single sequencer commits state roots on-chain. This bridge allows you to escape L1 congestion and access an ecosystem of instant, low-cost wrapped $BTC payments, NFTs, and DeFi. With support for Rust SDKs and Solana-style APIs, Bitcoin Hyper brings high-performance gaming and complex smart contracts to Bitcoin. If you want more info, check out our ‘ What is Bitcoin Hyper ’ guide. The market seems to be paying attention as the Bitcoin Hyper presale has raised over $28.8M so far. And smart money is moving. High-net-worth wallets have been making purchases as large as $500K . Our experts see a potential end-of-2026 high of $0.08625 , which, if you bought at today’s price, would see you with a potential ROI of over 545%. If you believe Vanguard and its peers will keep funneling conservative capital into spot Bitcoin, Layer 2s like $HYPER offer a different angle: upside tied not just to $BTC’s price, but to whether Bitcoin can finally host high-throughput applications at scale. Join the $HYPER presale. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

    "title": "Next 1000x Crypto for Bitcoin Believers? Bitcoin Hyper Presale Eyes Layer 2 Breakout",
    "body": "What to Know: Even as Bitcoin holds around $93K, Bitcoin’s base layer remains secure but slow, with high fees and no native smart contract environment, limiting real on-chain activity for everyday users. As demand for scalable on-chain applications grows, the lack of a high-speed execution layer around Bitcoin creates a structural gap for DeFi, gaming, and payments. Bitcoin Hyper introduces the first Bitcoin Layer 2 with SVM integration, targeting faster-than-Solana performance while leveraging Bitcoin as the settlement backbone. By delivering extremely low-latency execution, fast smart contracts, and Rust-based tooling, Bitcoin Hyper aims to make wrapped $BTC usable across DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. If you’re convinced Bitcoin is marching toward six figures, the bigger question is where the next asymmetric upside comes from. Right now, the world’s leading crypto is holding near $93K. History suggests the highest multiples don’t usually come from the base asset itself, but from the infrastructure built on top of it; think ERC-20 DeFi blue chips riding Ethereum’s 2020 breakout. Bitcoin’s problem is that it never had its own native DeFi and application stack to the same extent. Slow confirmation times, high fees during peak cycles, and the absence of native smart contracts have kept most real on-chain activity on other networks, even as Bitcoin dominates as a store of value and brand. That’s the gap Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is going after: a high-speed Bitcoin Layer 2 that brings Solana-style throughput directly to $BTC’s settlement layer. Instead of asking you to rotate out of Bitcoin into a ‘fast L1,’ Bitcoin Hyper is betting the next 1000x upside comes from plugging DeFi, gaming, and payments into Bitcoin’s existing liquidity. With a presale already into eight figures and early whales circling, Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as a bet not against Bitcoin, but on Bitcoin finally getting the performance layer it has been missing. For $BTC holders who want more than passive ‘number go up,’ that’s a compelling narrative to examine seriously. Bitcoin Hyper Turns BTC Into a High-Speed Application Layer Bitcoin Hyper is built for one simple outcome: letting you use Bitcoin like a modern, high-throughput network without abandoning Bitcoin’s security and brand. It introduces a dedicated Layer 2 that runs smart contracts using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) tooling, tuned to deliver faster performance than Solana itself for real-world transactions. For users, this translates into sub-second confirmation experiences and low fees on wrapped $BTC transfers, swaps, and dApps, rather than waiting on congested Bitcoin blocks. DeFi traders can move into pools, lending markets, and staking strategies at speed, while still ultimately settling back to Bitcoin as the base layer they trust via a Canonical Bridge . If you’re considering getting exposure, here’s a guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper. Developers get a Rust-based SDK and API to ship NFT platforms, gaming dApps, and high-frequency applications without fighting Bitcoin’s base-layer limitations. Bitcoin Hyper explicitly targets Solana-level speed while anchoring to Bitcoin, aiming to keep latency low enough for gaming and real-time apps. The presale has already pulled in $28.8M, a clear signal of early conviction behind the project’s thesis You can explore the Bitcoin Hyper presale now. Can $HYPER Be a 1000x for Bitcoin Maxis? If Bitcoin Hyper captures even a small portion of the broader Bitcoin DeFi and Layer 2 narrative market, our prediction suggests that $HYPER could reach $0.08625, delivering roughly 545% returns from the current presale price of $0.013365. That kind of upside depends on real usage, but the thesis is clear: bring Solana-like performance to where the Bitcoin liquidity already sits. You can read a Bitcoin Hyper price prediction breakdown for more scenario modeling. Momentum is already building around that idea. Whale buys include $500K , $379K , and $274K , all feeding into the $HYPER momentum. If Bitcoin does grind toward six figures over the next cycle, the infrastructure that lets $BTC behave like a modern programmable asset stands to benefit most. What is Bitcoin Hyper? The execution layer for crypto’s flagship: fast, cheap, and plugged directly into the world’s best-known crypto brand. The core opportunity here is simple: Bitcoin retains its role as pristine collateral and base money, while Bitcoin Hyper turns that collateral into something you can actually deploy across DeFi, gaming, and payments at high speed. If the market agrees that the next 1000x comes from building on Bitcoin rather than competing with it, $HYPER sits directly in that slipstream. Join the $HYPER presale now.

    "title": "This Subwave Says Bitcoin Price Is Headed For A 50% Crash To $42,000",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Tony Severino has revealed a historical bearish pattern that could send the Bitcoin price to as low as $42,000. This bearish outlook for BTC comes amid a rebound for the flagship crypto, with a recent surge above the psychological $90,000 level. Bitcoin Price Risks 50% Drop To $42,000 Based On This Pattern In an X post, Severino stated that the Bitcoin price likes to retrace to subwave 3/4 of wave 3/4 of its impulse. Based on this, the analyst indicated that BTC could crash to as low as $42,000 on wave C of this move to the downside. His accompanying chart showed that this decline could happen sometime at the start of next year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Can Hit These ‘Realistic’ Bullish Targets Before The Bear Market Begins This bearish Bitcoin price prediction comes amid BTC’s rebound above $90,000 following the end of quantitative tightening (QT) by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The flagship crypto has also rebounded amid optimism of another rate cut at this month’s FOMC meeting. CME FedWatch data shows there is almost a 90% chance that the Fed will lower rates again this month. However, despite these macro positives for the Bitcoin price, analysts such as Tony Severino have suggested that BTC is in a bear market and is likely to trend lower in the coming months. In an X post, he highlighted the BTC monthly chart, suggesting it showed a subtle volume breakout that confirmed a “not-so-subtle” trendline breakdown. Meanwhile, market technician JT described statements that the QT ending is bullish for the Bitcoin price as being a “fallacy.” He alluded to the possibility that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) may hike rates this month as one of the stressors to liquidity beyond QT. Peter Brandt Predicts Drop To Mid $40ks In an X post, veteran trader and analyst Peter Brandt predicted that the Bitcoin price could drop to mid $40,000. He stated that the upper boundary of the lower green zone starts below $70,000 and that the lower support boundary is in the mid $40,000. Notably, Brandt had previously predicted that BTC could drop to around $50,000 before it then rallies to around $200,000 in the next bull market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks Below 50-MA For The First Time This Cycle, Why A Crash To $38,000 Could Be Coming The veteran analyst noted that there have been five major bull market cycles for the Bitcoin price since its inception. He further stated that in all previous cycles, the violation of the dominant parabolic advance has been followed by a 75% plus correction with no exception. As such, he expects BTC to undergo another significant correction in this cycle, potentially dropping below $50,000. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $93,000, up almost 7% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "Is The Dogecoin Bottom In? This Price Level Could Be The Tell",
    "body": "Dogecoin is staging a sharp rebound from a key technical level that one analyst has flagged as the potential low of its current correction. Is The Dogecoin Bottom In? On X, crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) highlighted the $0.138 region as the decisive line. Posting a weekly DOGE chart, he wrote: “$0.138 still holding strong on Dogecoin. If DOGE can hold this level (Macro .382 + 200W SMA) and BTC + USDT hold their respective support and resistance levels then $0.138 will be the lows for this corrective period. Still got work to do. Main focus is still BTC and USDT D.” His chart shows Dogecoin trading on the 1-week timeframe, with the price recently wicking down into a dense support cluster around $0.138 and rebounding. That area coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement of the prior advance, explicitly marked “0.382 (0.13827),” and the rising 200-week simple moving average that has now climbed into the same zone. Furthermore, this area coincides with an upward trendline that has guided DOGE’s price action since mid-2023; a decisive break below it would be technically fatal. Related Reading: Here’s The Bullish Trend Developing To Trigger A 174% Move For The Dogecoin Price The bounce has been visible on lower timeframes as well. DOGE traded as low as $0.13443 yesterday before surging to $0.152 today, gaining more than 13% at the intraday high. Kevin has been emphasizing this level for weeks. On November 22 he told followers: “$0.138 is massive support on Dogecoin folks. You really do not want to see that lost on 3D-1W closes. Obviously BTC’s performance will be the determiner to that outcome so focus there first along with USDT D.” In his framework, the integrity of the DOGE support cluster is inseparable from Bitcoin’s higher-timeframe structure and stablecoin flows. The macro background is shifting in his favor. Yesterday Bitcoin rebounded from $86,184 to $92,307, extended to $93,958 today and is currently around $92,816. Commenting on BTC, Kevin noted: “A close above $91K on the 3D-1W candle supports the idea that the counter trend rally is beginning in my BTC corrective phase reversal zone. One day doesn’t make a trend let’s see what we can do.” Related Reading: Market Downturn Hits Dogecoin Hard: Is a Larger Correction on the Horizon? That statement builds on his November 25 outlook, where he argued that the corrective phase he has been tracking since August–September on BTC and the “Total 2” altcoin index is nearing completion. “There will be a bottom formed and a counter trend rally in the coming weeks on BTC and Altcoins,” he wrote, adding that “the corrective phase is almost over” but still needs “a little more time to form a proper bottom.” Kevin’s DOGE chart maps the alternatives clearly. Above, horizontal resistance near the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement sits around $0.19, while lower support is marked at the 0.236 retracement near $0.093 alongside longer-term trendlines. Whether $0.138 becomes the definitive bottom of Dogecoin’s correction depends on two conditions Kevin keeps repeating: DOGE must continue to hold the macro 0.382 plus 200-week SMA and the uptrend line on 3-day to weekly closes, and Bitcoin must confirm its own counter-trend rally with sustained higher-timeframe strength. For now, the market has made its tell clear. The answer to whether the Dogecoin bottom is in starts—and potentially ends—at $0.138. At press time, Dogecoin traded at $0.14976.

    "title": "Bitmine Buys Another 18,345 Ethereum ($54.94M) In Fresh Accumulation Push – Details",
    "body": "Ethereum has reclaimed the $3,000 level after a strong market reaction to improving macro conditions, offering investors a much-needed shift in momentum. The move comes just days after the Federal Reserve officially ended Quantitative Tightening (QT), a policy shift that immediately boosted liquidity expectations across all risk assets. With markets now pricing in an imminent interest rate cut, confidence has begun to return, and ETH is one of the first major assets to respond. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidation Dominance Hits Multi-Year High: The Real Cause Behind BTC’s Breakdown This rebound reflects more than just macro relief. According to data from Arkham, shared by Lookonchain, Bitmine continues to accumulate Ethereum at current prices, reinforcing bullish sentiment at a moment when many traders remain cautious. Bitmine’s persistent buying throughout the correction has become one of the most influential signals for on-chain analysts, suggesting that large players see long-term value even as the market wrestles with volatility. Reclaiming $3,000 places Ethereum back above a key psychological level, and the combination of supportive macro policy and whale accumulation provides a stronger foundation than the market had just weeks ago. Bitmine and Linked Wallets Expand Ethereum Holdings According to data from Arkham reported by Lookonchain, Bitmine has purchased another 18,345 ETH, worth approximately $54.94 million, just a few hours ago. This marks yet another large buy in a growing series of aggressive accumulation moves that Bitmine has made throughout the correction. Their continued willingness to buy at current levels signals strong confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value, even as the market navigates heightened volatility. Shortly after this report, Lookonchain highlighted activity from a newly created wallet, 0x52B7, which withdrew 30,278 ETH—valued at $91.16 million—from Kraken. The size and timing of the withdrawal have led analysts to speculate that this wallet may be linked to Bitmine or part of a broader accumulation strategy. Large withdrawals from exchanges typically indicate that the owner intends to hold the assets off-exchange, often for long-term storage or staking, rather than preparing to sell. If the wallet is indeed connected to Bitmine, this would bring their latest combined accumulation to nearly 50,000 ETH in a single day. Such behavior suggests strategic positioning ahead of potential macro-driven upside or internal confidence in Ethereum’s recovery. This kind of synchronized whale activity often precedes significant price shifts, reinforcing the idea that large players are preparing for a stronger market phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Cut In Half As $6.4B In Positions Vanish: Market Reset Accelerates ETH Reclaims $3,000 But Still Faces Key Resistance Ethereum’s 3-day chart shows a notable improvement after reclaiming the $3,000 level, but the broader trend still carries signs of fragility. The recent bounce followed a deep corrective move that sent ETH from the $4,500 region down to the $2,700–$2,800 support zone, where buyers finally stepped in with conviction. The strong lower wicks around this area confirm that demand remains active, but Ethereum has yet to fully recover its bullish structure. Price now trades just below the 50 SMA, which sits near the $3,100–$3,150 zone—an important short-term resistance level. A clean break above this moving average would signal renewed momentum and increase the chances of retesting the $3,400–$3,600 range. Meanwhile, the 100 SMA and 200 SMA remain slightly above price, reflecting the broader downtrend that has dominated since September. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Largest Hidden-Buying Spike of the Cycle Despite Losing $90K Level Volume has picked up slightly during the recovery, but it remains muted compared to the selling spikes seen during the drawdown. This indicates cautious buying rather than aggressive accumulation at these levels. To confirm a trend reversal, ETH must close above the 50 SMA and then challenge the cluster of resistance around $3,200–$3,300. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Analysts Turn Bullish on SUI as Token Extends Gains Amid Renewed Institutional Interest",
    "body": "Sui (SUI) is drawing renewed market attention after staging one of its strongest breakouts in months, rising sharply at a time when most large-cap altcoins remain range-bound. Related Reading: Bitcoin And The 2026 Fed Shift: Expert Says Markets Aren’t Ready The latest 31% surge was triggered by a series of developments that converged within days, most notably Coinbase’s approval to offer SUI trading to New York residents, a move that places the token inside one of the most heavily regulated crypto markets in the U.S. The rally also arrived immediately after one of the largest token unlocks of the month, an event that would normally dampen prices but instead saw buyers step in with force. SUI's price trends to the upside following a steep decline as seen on the daily chart. Source: SUIUSD on Tradingview New York Listing Boosts Liquidity and Institutional Demand SUI surged between 25% and 32% over the past 24 hours after Coinbase confirmed that New York residents can now buy and trade the token across its web and mobile platforms. The approval extends SUI’s reach into one of the most tightly regulated U.S. markets, strengthening its profile as a compliant layer-1 network and increasing accessibility for institutional investors. The listing comes at a notable time. On December 1, SUI unlocked approximately $82–86 million worth of tokens, increasing circulating supply by more than 0.5%. Large unlocks typically pressure prices, but SUI moved higher instead, signaling strong demand absorption. Trading volume has more than doubled, hitting roughly $1.5 billion, levels analysts say indicate genuine accumulation rather than short-lived speculation. The launch of USDsui, a fiat-backed stablecoin designed for payments and DeFi use across the Sui ecosystem, also contributed to renewed interest. Combined with Coinbase’s expansion, these developments have strengthened confidence in Sui’s broader market positioning. SUI Technical Indicators Point to Momentum Shift Price action shows that SUI recently rebounded from November’s lows near $1.12, climbing above the $1.60 support zone. Indicators such as RSI and MACD now suggest easing selling pressure and a potential shift in short-term momentum. Analysts note that breaking above the mid-Bollinger Band near $1.90 would confirm a broader trend reversal. SUI has also moved above the Keltner mid-band for the first time in weeks, with volume delta readings showing strong spot-market buying. The next major resistance sits between $1.80 and $1.95, followed by a wider zone extending to $2.30. A decisive close above $1.92 is viewed as critical for invalidating November’s downtrend. Rally Depends on Volume Holding Market watchers say the current rally hinges on sustained demand. If daily volume remains above $1.5 billion and price holds the $1.60–$1.67 support zone, institutional participation could continue to push the token higher toward the $1.90 level. Related Reading: $93K And Climbing: Analysts Say Bitcoin’s Push To $100K Has Begun However, weakening volume or a drop below $1.48 may signal that SUI has formed a local top. For now, sentiment remains constructive as the token benefits from increased U.S. accessibility, improving technical signals, and expanding ecosystem activity.
