    "title": "Analyst Highlights Fibonacci Level That Could Put Dogecoin Price Top Above $10",
    "body": "Crypto analyst DOGECAPITAL has drawn attention to a Fibonacci level that indicates that the Dogecoin price top is above $10. The analyst also highlighted the meme coin’s performance during past bull cycles to explain why it could rally to double digits. Dogecoin Price Eyes Rally Above $10 Based on These Fibonacci Extensions In an X post, DOGECAPITAL predicted that the Dogecoin price could rally above $10, which would mark the top for the foremost meme coin. This came as he noted that the monthly DOGE chart highlights where major cycle peaks have historically formed using Fibonacci extensions and that this pattern is “remarkably consistent.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Rapid Accumulation Suggests Sharp Upward Sweep Is Coming The crypto analyst mentioned that in the first cycle, the Dogecoin price topped exactly at the 4.236 Fibonacci level. In the second cycle, DOGE is said to have peaked again at the 4.236 Fibonacci level. DOGECAPITAL remarked that this pattern isn’t random but rather a structural behavior. He then stated that if this pattern continues into the next cycle, the data strongly suggests that the Dogecoin price’s upcoming cycle top could again align with the 4.236 Fibonacci level, which currently sits at $33.25. DOGECAPITAL added history doesn’t repeat perfectly, but it often rhymes. In this case, DOGE has followed its long-term Fibonacci structure with “near-perfect accuracy,” which is why he is confident that the meme coin could reach this price target. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that DOGECAPITAL’s accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could reach this $33.25 target between now and 2028. Interestingly, the chart showed that DOGE could rally to as high as $100 if it reaches the upper boundary of the ascending channel. A rally to these targets would mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for the meme coin, whose current ATH is $0.74. Market Cap Doesn’t Matter For DOGE A potential Dogecoin price rally to $33.25 would give the meme coin a market cap of around $5.6 trillion. However, DOGECAPITAL stated that market cap has never dictated how DOGE moves. He said that if it did, half the insane runs in crypto wouldn’t exist. The analyst noted that Shiba Inu exploded to a massive valuation in 2021 with no “realistic” justification, yet the market still sent it to such highs. Related Reading: Analyst Says the Worst Is Over For Dogecoin, Predicts Rally To $0.8 DOGECAPITAL stated that his focus is on the long-term Fibonacci structure and that the Dogecoin price has topped at the 4.236 Fib level in two separate cycles. He added that this is the entire point of the chart and that it is not tied to any quarter, fundamentals, or market cap logic. The analyst also claimed that short-term volatility doesn’t erase a decade-long pattern and that if the Fib structure breaks, he will adjust accordingly. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.14, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "New Hope For Crypto: Senators Introduce Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act",
    "body": "In a major new development for the crypto industry, Senators Ron Wyden and Cynthia Lummis announced on Monday evening the introduction of a bipartisan, standalone version of the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA). This legislation aims to provide much-needed clarity for software developers and infrastructure providers in the blockchain space, particularly concerning their classification under federal law. New Crypto Bill To Protect Blockchain Developers According to the detailed press release regarding the matter, the BRCA specifies that developers and providers who do not have control over user funds will not be classified as money transmitters. Senator Lummis highlighted the ongoing challenges faced by blockchain developers, stating: Blockchain developers who have simply written code and maintain open-source infrastructure have lived under threat of being classified as money transmitters for far too long. This designation makes no sense when they never touch, control, or have access to user funds, and unnecessarily limits innovation. Related Reading: Crucial Role Of The CLARITY Act In Avoiding A New October 10 Crypto Crash, Expert Explains Lummis emphasized that the bill provides developers with the clarity needed to advance digital finance without the fear of legal repercussions for activities that do not pose a money laundering risk. Lummis added, “It’s time to stop treating software developers like banks simply because they write code.” Senator Wyden echoed these concerns, arguing that imposing the same regulatory requirements on developers as those applied to exchanges or brokers is fundamentally flawed. Main Highlights Of The BRCA The Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act aims to set clear federal standards defining when blockchain developers and service providers can be exempt from money transmitter regulations. Under current legislation toward crypto, the Senators assert blockchain developers face regulatory ambiguities that have not only stifled innovation but also driven many projects offshore, as they navigate conflicting regulations across different states. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Its ‘Lower-Band Prison’ As Daily Trend Flips The bill specifically establishes that a “non-controlling developer or provider” refers to any entity that develops or maintains distributed ledger technology but does not possess the unilateral authority to initiate or execute transactions involving users’ digital assets without third-party consent. In addition, the crypto bill clarifies protected activities, including the development or publication of software for distributed ledgers, maintenance services for blockchain networks, offering customer self-custody solutions, and providing necessary infrastructure to support distributed ledger services. Importantly, while the bill allows states to enforce their laws consistent with federal regulations, it also prevents them from imposing money transmitter requirements on developers engaged solely in the specified protected activities.

    "title": "Trump-Powell Conflict Fuels Volatility While Retail Sells Bitcoin At A Loss – Details",
    "body": "Bitcoin has entered a fresh bout of volatility after a rare and highly charged response from Jerome Powell, following reports that federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation related to his conduct as Federal Reserve Chair. In a direct and unusually pointed statement, Powell said: “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Fed setting rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.” Related Reading: CVDD Model Signals Bitcoin Is Not Yet Deeply Undervalued: Drawdown Lags Historical Cycles The market reaction was immediate. Bitcoin dropped from the $92,500 area to nearly $90,500, reflecting heightened uncertainty as traders reassessed political and macro risks. The move interrupted an otherwise stable consolidation phase and reintroduced volatility at a moment when BTC was attempting to build support above the $90,000 level. What makes this episode particularly notable is the shift in Powell’s public stance. Over the past 12 months, despite repeated criticism from President Trump, Powell consistently declined to engage, often responding with variations of “I have no response or comment.” That long-standing silence broke yesterday. As markets digest the implications, Bitcoin now finds itself at the intersection of macro policy, political pressure, and investor psychology. The next reaction—both from policymakers and from risk assets—could prove decisive for short-term price direction. Retail Fear Persists as Short-Term Holders Capitulate Within the Uptrend A recent CryptoQuant analysis adds another layer to the current political and macro-driven volatility, revealing that retail investors remain fearful of short-term price swings even as Bitcoin maintains a broader upward structure. The Short-Term Holder SOPR (STH SOPR) highlights a recurring behavioral pattern that tends to appear during corrective phases within a larger bull trend. Despite Bitcoin printing higher highs and higher lows throughout 2024 and 2025, short-term investors have been consistently realizing losses. Toward the end of last year, retail sentiment deteriorated sharply, with the STH SOPR dropping to around 0.98. Levels last seen in November 2022, when Bitcoin was trading near $16,000. While the indicator has not fully entered extreme capitulation territory below 0.98, it has remained under the neutral 1.00 level for more than 70 days, signaling sustained selling at a loss. This divergence is critical when STH SOPR remains below 1.00, coinciding with extended consolidations or corrective phases, driven by heightened pressure since Bitcoin broke above its previous all-time high. Historically, periods where STH SOPR stays below 1.00 coincide with extended consolidation or corrective phases, driven by elevated fear and realized losses. However, during the current uptrend, these episodes have repeatedly marked favorable accumulation zones. The mismatch between rising prices and capitulating retail behavior often reflects opportunity rather than weakness. This highlights Bitcoin’s underlying structural strength despite short-term volatility. Related Reading: Ethereum Long-Term Cost Basis Holds Firm: Structural Floor Forms Near $2.8K Bitcoin Consolidates Below Key Resistance as Volatility Compresses Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows the market in a consolidation phase following a sharp correction from the October highs near $120,000. After losing the $100,000 psychological level, BTC found demand in the low-$80,000s before rebounding toward the $90,000–$94,000 range, where price is currently stalling. This zone has clearly become a short-term equilibrium. With buyers defending higher lows but struggling to generate enough momentum for a decisive breakout. From a trend perspective, Bitcoin remains below the 50-week moving average, which is now acting as dynamic resistance around the mid-$90,000 area. In contrast, the 100-week moving average continues to slope upward well below the price. Reinforcing the idea that the broader macro trend remains intact despite recent weakness. The 200-week moving average, far lower, continues to define the long-term bull market structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Remains In A High-Risk Zone As Short-Term Holders Stay Underwater Volume has compressed significantly during this consolidation, suggesting reduced participation and indecision. This typically precedes a volatility expansion rather than a continuation of slow, sideways trading. As long as BTC holds above the rising 100-week moving average, downside appears structurally limited. Failure to reclaim the $94,000 resistance zone would keep the market vulnerable to another leg of consolidation before a sustainable trend resumes.

    "title": "Get Ready For An XRP Price Explosion Once This Happens; Analyst",
    "body": "Analysts are calling for an XRP price explosion, as the cryptocurrency’s market structure and the reappearance of historically reliable technical patterns support this bullish outlook. Although XRP experienced a brief rebound at the beginning of 2026, its price has since given back some of those gains and is now trading slightly above $2.0. Nevertheless, analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s near-term growth and have identified a key setup that could trigger the anticipated surge. XRP Price Prepares For Major Explosion Market expert CRYPTOWZRD has shared a fresh technical analysis of XRP, pointing to a familiar setup that previously led to an explosive price surge. He stated that XRP has spent more than a year trading sideways, forming a base that closely resembles an early pre-rally phase. Related Reading: Wall Street Analyst Is Still Bullish On Bitcoin, Predicts Price Recovery This sideways behavior had preceded a sharp vertical breakout during the 2024 bull cycle. CRYPTOWZRD noted that the current market structure mirrors this setup, suggesting that history may repeat itself if conditions align. His chart supports this view by showing XRP locked in a broad horizontal range for an extended period. In the past, XRP’s price repeatedly bounced between a clearly defined yellow support zone and red resistance bands, confirming range-bound behavior and accumulation. On the chart, the historical breakout is visible as a strong, impulsive upward move that followed XRP’s retest of support and the invalidation of the previous downtrend. Following its initial price rally in July 2024, XRP entered a topping phase near the upper red resistance area. After failing to hold those highs, the cryptocurrency saw a sharp pullback described as a “quick dump,” which drove prices back toward a key support region in the next month. Interestingly, XRP began to trade within a descending channel after the pullback. Once the price broke the channel’s upper boundary, it triggered a powerful rally, propelling XRP from approximately $0.5 to over $2. A similar descending channel is now visible in XRP’s current market structure, reinforcing the analyst’s view that another parabolic move may be unfolding. In this setup, XRP has already broken above the upper boundary of the channel, and now its price is expected to push through the red resistance bands positioned between $3.4 and $3.7 Analyst Warns That XRP Must Clear $2.26 Or Risk Another Drop Speaking on current price action, crypto analyst ChartNerd warns that XRP could see another price correction if it fails to break and hold above the $2.26 support level. According to the expert, both the weekly 20 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the middle regression band of the Gaussian Channel are acting as resistance. Related Reading: Here’s Why the Bitcoin Price Was Able To Break $94,000 The chart also shows these indicators converging at the $2.26 support level, strengthening the barrier XRP must overcome. A failure to break above this level could cause the price to retrace back toward multi-month support near $1.9, where a higher low could form if buyers step in.

Bitcoin started a recovery wave above $90,000 and $90,500. The price is trading above $91,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $90,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it stays above the $90,000 zone. Bitcoin Price Stays In A Range Bitcoin price managed to stay above the $89,500 support and started a minor recovery wave . BTC was able to settle above $90,000 and $90,500. The bulls were able to push the price above $91,500, and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $93,770 swing high to the $89,225 low. However, the price seems to be facing a major hurdle near the $92,000 level. The 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $93,770 swing high to the $89,225 low is acting as a resistance. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $90,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin is now trading above $91,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . If the price remains stable above $90,500, it could attempt a fresh increase. Immediate resistance is near the $92,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $92,800 level. The next resistance could be $93,450. A close above the $93,450 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $94,000 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $94,500 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $95,000 and $95,500. Another Drop In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $92,000 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $91,000 level. The first major support is near the $90,650 level and the trend line. The next support is now near the $90,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $89,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $89,250, below which BTC might accelerate lower in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now near the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $91,000, followed by $90,650. Major Resistance Levels – $92,000 and $92,800.",

    "body": "Markets pulled $454 million from crypto exchange-traded products last week as investors stepped back amid rising bets that the US Federal Reserve may not cut rates soon. Related Reading: CZ Fuels Optimism As Binance Coin’s $1,000 Target Trends According to CoinShares data and market reports, the move erased much of the early-week gains that had pushed roughly $1.5 billion into the sector during the first two trading days. The shift was sharp and broad, though a few assets saw money flow in. Smart Money Flees Bitcoin While Some Altcoins Attract Cash Bitcoin-linked products bore the brunt of withdrawals, with about $405 million leaving Bitcoin ETPs. Ethereum funds were also hit, posting roughly $116 million in outflows. Multi-asset crypto products reported net redemptions near $21 million. Based on reports, these outflows came as recent inflation and jobs data made investors lower the odds of a March Fed rate cut, weakening appetite for risk assets that had been boosted by earlier optimism. Selective Inflows Show Pockets Of Interest But not all tokens were abandoned. XRP funds drew around $46 million in fresh money, while Solana products attracted about $33 million. Smaller tokens, including some newer layer-one projects, picked up modest flows as investors hunted for opportunities beyond the main leaders. Total assets under management across global crypto ETPs remained near $182 billion, a figure that shows scale despite the weekly redemptions. Regional Patterns Reveal US Outflows And Overseas Inflows According to regional flow data, US-linked crypto investment products saw roughly $569 million exit last week. That outflow contrasted with inflows in some European and North American markets: Germany attracted about $59 million, Canada added $25 million, and Switzerland drew roughly $21 million. The pattern suggests capital moved away from US vehicles and into other jurisdictions where investor appetite held up better. What Traders And Analysts Are Saying Based on reports from market analysts, the reversal came as traders reassessed the timing of monetary easing. With inflation readings remaining firmer than expected and the labor market showing resilience, market pricing shifted and risk assets were repriced. Some analysts warned that volatility could persist while others noted that pockets of demand for specific altcoins might support short-term rallies. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator According to observers, the outflows highlight how sensitive crypto fund flows are to macroeconomic signals. While $454 million is a meaningful weekly move, the sector’s overall AUM near $182 billion means a single week does not rewrite the market picture. Investors will likely watch upcoming economic releases and Fed communications closely; fund flows are expected to respond quickly to any sign that rate-cut hopes are returning or fading further.

    "body": "As the January 15 markup of the crypto market structure bill—known as the CLARITY Act—draws closer, reports indicate that Coinbase (COIN) is reconsidering its support for the legislation. A Monday report from Bloomberg suggests this shift in position is contingent on whether the anticipated bill includes provisions beyond enhanced disclosure requirements tied to stablecoin rewards. High Stakes For Coinbase The CLARITY Act is expected to be marked up in at least one Senate committee this Thursday, and Coinbase’s potential withdrawal could have significant implications for the bill. A source familiar with Coinbase’s stance told Bloomberg that the exchange would re-evaluate its support if the legislation veers too far from its interests, particularly regarding stablecoin incentives. Some insiders suggest the bill might restrict the ability to provide rewards to regulated financial institutions, a move that aligns with the banking sector’s concerns about losing deposits to crypto platforms. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Its ‘Lower-Band Prison’ As Daily Trend Flips Coinbase currently holds applications for a national trust charter that could permit it to offer those kinds of rewards under regulatory rules. However, many crypto-native firms are pushing back against potential restrictions, arguing that such measures could disrupt competition in the market. The stakes for Coinbase are high, as rewards programs play a crucial role in its business model. The exchange allows users to earn 3.5% rewards on Circle’s USDC holdings. Should the market-structure bill include bans on these incentives, fewer users might choose to hold stablecoins on the platform. This could jeopardize an anticipated revenue stream projected at $1.3 billion in 2025, according to Bloomberg. Banking Vs. Crypto The GENIUS Act, passed into law in July of last year, prohibits stablecoin issuers from offering interest on token holdings, and does not prevent third-party partners like Coinbase from providing rewards tied to customer balances. The banking industry, however, argues that allowing exchanges to pay such rewards could negatively impact bank deposits and, consequently, community lending. As reported by Bitcoinist over the past month, the American Bankers Association (ABA) has voiced concerns that this situation could displace “billions” from local lending, allegedly harming small businesses and households. In contrast, Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase’s chief policy officer, has argued that maintaining rewards tied to stablecoins is crucial for preserving the dollar’s dominance, especially in light of China’s announcement to start offering interest on its digital yuan. Banking Lobby Fights Back A potential compromise being discussed would permit only licensed banking entities or financial institutions to provide rewards on stablecoin balances. Related Reading: Why The $2.9 Billion Bitcoin Whale Buy Could Spell Doom For The Market Recently, five crypto firms, including Ripple, Circle, and Paxos, received conditional approvals from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to become national trust banks, a move met with opposition from the banking lobby. If restrictions are indeed imposed, the report suggests that this could lead to creative workarounds as crypto firms seek alternative ways to reward customers.

    "body": "Monero (XMR) is leading the crypto market bounce by breaking out of a macro resistance level and breaching above the $600 barrier for the first time. A legendary trader has suggested that the cryptocurrency is mirroring silver’s historical breakout and could see a massive price discovery rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tops $92,000 As DOJ Subpoenas Escalate Trump-Powell Fight Monero Soars To New Highs On Monday, Monero outperformed the rest of the market, surging nearly 21% toward its new all-time high of $611.01. The privacy-focused cryptocurrency has been leading the start-of-year market rally, experiencing a 43% increase over the past seven days. XMR’s rally has been fueled by renewed interest in privacy tokens and redirected liquidity toward the project, which has driven its market capitalization to $10 billion for the first time. Amid this performance, veteran trader Peter Brandt drew a parallel between Monero and Silver’s long-term charts, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could be near a massive breakout. In an X post, Brandt compared Monero’s current rally to silver’s historical breakout, which led to a massive run toward new highs. Silver saw a multi-decade price setup in which its price accumulated below and retested a macro ascending resistance trendline. According to the chart, its price formed its long-term resistance during its 2011 peak, when it reached a slightly higher ATH of $49.83 before correcting. During its Q4 2025 rally, silver finally broke above this key level, nearly doubling its price toward its latest ATH of $86.23. Similarly, Monero has been forming its multi-year ascending trendline in the monthly timeframe since its 2017 high. In 2021, the cryptocurrency retested this area, also hitting a slightly higher ATH before retracing. Now, XMR has broken out of its ascending resistance and could see a similar path to silver’s recent breakout into price discovery, the post suggested. XMR to See 50% Breakout Or Breakdown Next? Market observer TraderSZ recently shared an optimistic outlook for Monero once it broke through its crucial resistance area and turned this level into support. To the trader, the cryptocurrency could reach three main price targets if momentum continues. Per the post, the initial breakout level could reach the $685 area, a more than 30% rally from the resistance level. Moreover, it could surge between 50% and 80% toward the $790 and $900 levels, like silver’s recent price discovery progression in the monthly chart. Analyst 0xMarioNawfal also highlighted XMR’s performance as “price continues to trend aggressively higher, breaking through previous resistance levels with strong momentum and minimal pullback.” To him, the structure remains bullish, with buyers stepping in and “no clear signs of distribution yet.” As a result, he forecasted potential volatility but added that as long as the price holds above recent breakout levels, the trend will remain intact. Related Reading: Solana Price Jumps, But Network Adoption Remains Weak Nonetheless, Ali Martinez posted a more concerning forecast for the cryptocurrency, suggesting that a significant correction may be around the corner. According to the chart, Monero has been forming a multi-year rising wedge pattern since 2017, with the price bouncing between the upper and lower boundaries. Based on this, XMR could likely fail to turn the macro resistance into support and begin a long-term 50% decline toward the $300 area, where the pattern’s lower boundary is currently located. As of this writing, Monero is trading at $597, a 47.5% increase in the monthly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin HODLer Selloff Ending? LTH Outflows Decline",
    "body": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin long-term holder outflows have been declining recently, a potential sign that selling pressure may be fading. Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Netflow Is Getting Less Negative In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the netflow associated with the Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs). The LTHs refer to BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins for a period longer than 155 days. Related Reading: Solana Price Jumps, But Network Adoption Remains Weak Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. As such, the LTHs with their long holding time are considered to include the resolute hands of the market. Though, while these HODLers tend to be patient, they have shown several phases of distribution during the last couple of years. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the monthly netflow of the Bitcoin LTHs. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin LTHs observed streaks of net outflows during both the bull rallies of 2024, suggesting that the diamond hands of the market participated in profit-taking. A short phase of distribution also appeared in mid-2025, indicating that the LTHs were doing yet another wave of profit realization. This selling was followed by a brief period of net inflows for the cohort, which was then followed by another wave of distribution in late 2025. This last phase of distribution is still ongoing, as the monthly netflow associated with the LTHs remains negative. The latest selloff has been a bit different from the last three, however, as it has occurred alongside bearish momentum in the cryptocurrency, not a price jump. While the distribution has continued, its intensity has been dropping lately as the netflow of the Bitcoin LTHs has been becoming less negative. As the analytics firm explains: Net outflows have rolled over from extreme levels, indicating that the market is progressively absorbing long-held supply and that a large portion of overhead supply may now be largely worked through. The decline in net outflows has come alongside a drop in the Realized Profit of the group, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. The Realized Profit here is an indicator that measures the total amount of profit that LTHs are realizing through their transactions. From the chart, it’s apparent that the profit-taking from the cohort was elevated earlier, but recently, the Realized Profit has dropped to a low level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Drop To $69,000 If Pennant Support Breaks, Analyst Warns The analytics firm noted: Such conditions are often associated with heightened uncertainty and tend to emerge during mid-bull market pauses or the early stages of deeper bear markets. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $91,800, down almost 3% in the last seven days. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Standard Chartered Sees Ethereum At $40,000 By 2030, Cuts 2026 Target",
    "body": "Standard Chartered has set a new long-range target of $40,000 for Ethereum (ETH) by end-2030, while cutting its end-2026 forecast sharply, arguing that Ethereum’s relative setup is improving even as Bitcoin-led weakness has weighed on absolute crypto price targets. In a research note, the bank’s digital assets analyst Geoff Kendrick framed 2026 as a potential inflection point for Ethereum versus bitcoin, despite revising down its medium-term ETH-USD path. “We think ETH’s prospects have improved. We therefore expect the cross to gradually return to its 2021 highs,” Kendrick wrote, pointing to a rebound in the ETH/BTC relationship as the core expression of his thesis. Standard Chartered Recasts Ethereum Outlook Standard Chartered now expects ether to end 2026 at $7,500, down from its prior $12,000 estimate, before rising to $15,000 in 2027 (cut from $18,000) and $22,000 in 2028 (cut from $25,000), with $30,000 penciled in for 2029 (raised from $25,000) and $40,000 by end-2030. Related Reading: This Ethereum Triangle Breakout Puts Price Above $24,000, Here’s The Path “I think 2026 will be the year of Ethereum, much like 2021 was,” Kendrick writes. The bank attributes the near-term markdown to Bitcoin’s drag on dollar-denominated crypto performance, with Kendrick noting that weaker BTC action has “weighed on the outlook for digital assets priced in dollars,” forcing lower absolute targets through 2028 even as Ethereum’s relative fundamentals strengthen. Kendrick highlighted a set of Ethereum-specific supports that, in his view, are more likely to show up in relative performance than in immediate spot-price upside. He pointed to continued accumulation by Bitmine Immersion Technologies, which the note described as the largest Ethereum-focused digital asset treasury company, at a time when ETF inflows have “temporarily stalled” and broader corporate treasury buying has cooled. Related Reading: Ethereum Long-Term Cost Basis Holds Firm: Structural Floor Forms Near $2.8K He also cited Ethereum’s centrality to stablecoins, tokenized real-world assets, and DeFi as structural demand drivers, and emphasized execution on plans to increase Ethereum layer-1 throughput by roughly 10x over the next two to three years. “Analysis shows that higher throughput translates into higher market cap,” Kendrick wrote. Regulation was flagged as a further potential tailwind. Kendrick pointed to the US CLARITY Act as a development that could be supportive for the sector and “particularly ETH” if it helps unlock another phase of DeFi activity. The US Senate is due to review the bill on Jan. 15 with possible passage in Q1. For traders, the framework implies that Standard Chartered’s highest-conviction expression is less about pinning an exact ETH-USD level in the next 12 months and more about whether Ethereum can reclaim relative ground versus bitcoin as throughput, stablecoin-heavy activity, and policy clarity compound into 2026 and beyond. At press time, ETH traded at $3,126. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins is confident that a long-awaited crypto market structure bill could find its way into US President Donald Trump’s office for signature before the end of the year. The SEC chief highlighted ongoing efforts during an interview with Fox Business to clarify rules around digital asset trading and said the bill could provide much-needed guidance to investors and trading platforms. Related Reading: Crypto Products Post $454M Weekly Outflows On Fed Jitters Atkins Expresses Confidence Atkins, who was confirmed by the Senate in April 2025 in a 52-44 vote, said tokenization and faster settlement systems are part of the next phase for US markets. He argued that a market structure law would give firms and investors clearer signals about which rules apply to trading in digital assets. Reports have disclosed that the chair sees the bill as fitting the administration’s push to make the US more competitive in crypto. This is a big week for crypto – Congress is on the cusp of upgrading our financial markets for the 21st century. I am wholly supportive of Congress providing clarity on the jurisdictional split between the SEC and the @CFTC. pic.twitter.com/NtDWRW85kL — Paul Atkins (@SECPaulSAtkins) January 12, 2026 Atkins discussed the regulatory forecast for crypto this year during an interview with Fox Business. Source: Paul Atkins Lawmakers’ Calendar And Odds Based on reports from financial analysts, the path to passage is not guaranteed. One market note put the chance of the bill clearing Congress in 2026 at roughly 50-60%, and warned that delays could push final action into 2027. Other analysts have suggested a longer road, saying implementation of final market structure rules might not be settled for years if political dynamics change. What Is Being Negotiated The draft measures under discussion aim to define which federal agency supervises different types of digital instruments, establish standards for trading venues that list tokens, and create clearer reporting rules for market participants. Reports have disclosed that committee markups are expected before any Senate floor vote, and those sessions will shape the bill’s final text. Industry Reaction, Market Talk The optimism expressed by Atkins has been welcomed by industry associations, as they see that clear guidance could lead to more institutional capital flowing into the onshore crypto trading space. On the other hand, the sentiment from many companies is that there is still a level of caution surrounding future regulations. Although regulators continue to show a level of agreement regarding overall regulation, the details of custody, custody provider(s), and oversight split between various regulatory agencies must be agreed upon by Congress before any definitive progress can be made. This back-and-forth between Congress and regulatory agencies has caused the markets to react in a pattern of quick positive movements followed by corresponding negative movements due to legislative inaction.

    "title": "Bitcoin Could Be Entering A Supercycle, Fidelity Warns",
    "body": "Fidelity Labs managing partner Parth Gargava says bitcoin may be transitioning away from its familiar, halving-linked four-year rhythm and into something closer to a “supercycle”, a regime that could keep prices elevated for longer and make drawdowns less severe, if structural demand continues to build. Speaking in Fidelity’s Jan. 9 crypto outlook for 2026 video, Gargava anchored the discussion in the cycle framework many market participants have used for years: peaks arriving roughly a year and a half after each halving. “Traditionally, what we have seen is Bitcoin has had this four-year cycle,” he said, adding that the pattern has been “highly correlated to Bitcoin’s halving events.” He pointed to the 2016 halving followed by a peak in December 2017 near $20,000, and the 2020 halving followed by another peak in 2021 about 18 months later. That history matters because it frames the debate around the most recent halving in April 2024. Gargava acknowledged the straightforward inference some investors make from prior cycles: “So maybe we are past that peak price.” But he positioned that view as only one side of the argument, highlighting a competing thesis that the market’s structure is evolving. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Selloff Ending? LTH Outflows Decline “On the other side, you’re also seeing a lot of arguments around how we might have entered into a supercycle as opposed to what we have seen in the past four years,” Gargava said. “And what a super cycle really means is you might have more prolonged highs, longer highs, and shallower dips.” Gargava credited Fidelity Digital Assets’ research team for outlining what he called the “super cycle mechanism,” and suggested an analogy to the commodities market in the 2000s. The key point was not that bitcoin would mechanically copy commodities, but that a sustained, multi-year bid can alter how markets behave, extending expansions and compressing the depth of selloffs. JUST IN: $5 trillion Fidelity talks about how #Bitcoin might have entered a “supercycle” Bullish 🚀 pic.twitter.com/IUv3GVHwEW — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) January 12, 2026 Three Forces That Could Push Bitcoin Into A Supercycle He outlined three drivers he believes could underpin that kind of regime shift. First is “steady buy-in by institutions focused on ETFs,” which Gargava framed as persistent demand rather than episodic speculative bursts. In his telling, ETFs can function as a channel that keeps incremental capital flowing even when sentiment softens, potentially changing the market’s typical post-peak unwind. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tops $92,000 As DOJ Subpoenas Escalate Trump-Powell Fight Second is policy. Gargava pointed to “pro-crypto policies” in the US as a supportive backdrop, implying that a friendlier regulatory stance could reduce headline risk and encourage broader participation from investors and intermediaries that previously stayed on the sidelines. Third is market maturation and changing correlations. “We’re also seeing how the crypto market as a whole is maturing and deviating from the S&P 500 and precious metals,” he said. The implication is that bitcoin’s trading behavior may be becoming less captive to traditional risk-asset moves and the simple “digital gold” narrative, an evolution that could matter for positioning, hedging, and macro sensitivity. Notably, Gargava did not claim the four-year cycle is definitively broken. Instead, he presented a live question for 2026: whether bitcoin continues to follow a post-halving path that culminates in a familiar, sharp boom-and-bust pattern, or whether structural forces: ETF-driven institutional demand, a more supportive US policy tone, and a maturing market profile support a longer, steadier expansion with “shallower dips.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $92,182.

    "body": "XRP is trading at around $2.06 on January 13, 2026, leaving its price action a full step below the zone that capped its last rally that ended with a high of $3.65 in July 2025. However, predictions that point to XRP reclaiming that peak and then pushing into new highs above $3.8, have been on the front page of bank research notes and trader-led chart projections. Notably, various technical analyses have suggested that XRP is programmed to return back into the upper-$3s and into new price territories this year. Standard Chartered’s XRP Target Clears $3.8 XRP’s all-time high price now looks out of reach, especially considering the cryptocurrency is now struggling to leave $2 behind. At the time of writing, XRP has dropped by about 44% from its July 2025 peak of $3.65, but institutional buys from Spot XRP ETFs are still giving glimmers of hope. Related Reading: XRP Back At The Edge: Will Breaking $2 Barrier Rewrite Its History? One of the most recently notable institutional-style projections from XRP comes from Standard Chartered’s digital assets research, which lays out a multi-year path that sees XRP breaking well above the $3.8 threshold. According to analysts at the bank, XRP is slated to reach as high as $8 by the end of 2026, a level that comfortably eclipses the previous peak and implies roughly 300% upside from current levels if certain conditions hold. Interestingly, this outlook came from Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s Global Head of Digital Assets Research. The prediction was made based on an outlook of continued institutional adoption and strong inflows into XRP-based spot ETFs. Technical Outlooks As Ripple Heads Into A Consequential 2026 Recent technical commentary from multiple analysts has converged on a bullish bias for XRP. For instance, XRP analyst EGRAG CRYPTO pointed out a developing breakout retest structure on the monthly candlestick timeframe. According to the analyst, historical probabilities favor upside as long as XRP holds above the $1.60 to $1.40 range on higher timeframes, with long-term channel projections placing the XRP price as high as $22. For a shorter-term perspective, Crypto Feras described XRP’s recent break above $2 as a bullish reversal signal. His analysis points to $2.67 and $3.01 as the next resistance levels, areas that could open the path toward a full retest of the prior peak near $3.8 if cleared. Adding to this, ChartNerd noted that XRP’s long-term upside fractal structure is still valid despite the recent XRP price correction. Related Reading: Analyst Updates XRP Price Prediction: Why $16 Is Still On The Table These price projections are being viewed more favorably against the backdrop of Ripple’s momentum heading into the year. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently pointed to strong progress in 2025 with examples of major acquisitions of Ripple Prime and GTreasury and a growing global licensing footprint. Now that Ripple is positioning itself for what its leadership has described as a consequential 2026, the combination of technical outlooks and company fundamentals has strengthened the narrative that XRP could be approaching a move to new all-time highs.

    "title": "What’s Going On With Bitcoin And The Stock Market? Analyst Breaks It Down",
    "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) and the stock market have experienced sharp price swings and declines since 2025. Because of this volatility, a crypto analyst has warned that the market correction could intensify further in 2026. In a detailed analysis, he outlines a bearish scenario for Bitcoin, suggesting the flagship cryptocurrency could soon face another price crash amid persistent downward pressure in the broader stock market. Analyst Warns Of Major Bitcoin And Stock Market Plunge Market analyst Doctor Profit has raised concerns about the direction of the crypto and traditional markets, warning that both Bitcoin and stocks are currently in a severe bear market. In a technical breakdown on X this Monday, the expert highlighted three major bearish setups forming simultaneously in Bitcoin. Related Reading: Why The $2.9 Billion Bitcoin Whale Buy Could Spell Doom For The Market He highlighted a massive Bearish Divergence on the weekly and monthly charts, a clear bearish flag signaling a potential drop toward $70,000, and a possible Head and Shoulder pattern that could still play out. While he acknowledged that Bitcoin could still experience short-term price increases and briefly rise toward the $97,000-$107,000 range due to strong liquidity, he said that the ultimate target remains $70,000. Doctor Profit emphasized that Bitcoin’s potential decline to $70,000 could go two ways. It could either break out of the bearish flag to that downside target or complete the Head and Shoulders pattern before reaching $70,000. He stated that he will not add new short positions at current prices but plans to increase them aggressively from $115,000 to $125,000 if Bitcoin moves into the $97,000 to $107,000 range. The analyst painted a similarly grim picture for the stock market. He said he was “ultra-bearish” on both Bitcoin and the financial system. He also noted that the banks are stressed and that forced liquidations in precious metals like Silver are creating ripples across the broader market. Additionally, Doctor Profit noted that insider activity shows clear signs of panic among investors, with record levels of selling since August 2025. Because of this, the analyst believes that the market is heading for a 2008-style crash. Consequently, he has concluded that the current market conditions are too extreme. On the bright side, Doctor Profit said that although he maintains short positions on stocks and Bitcoin, he remains bullish on Gold and Silver. He explained that any upside to the $97,000-$107,000 range will prompt him to increase his short exposure and roll spot profits for BTC from $85,000 into these positions. Crypto Markets Brace For Key US Decisions Toward the end of his analysis, Doctor Profit discussed upcoming events that could influence Bitcoin and the broader financial markets this week. He stated that the US CPI inflation forecast of 2.7% will be released this Tuesday. Other than this, the rest of the week is expected to have few market-moving events. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hits Crash Line, But This Time Is Not Random Doctor Profit has also highlighted January 15 as an important date because US lawmakers will vote on the CLARITY Act. He explained that if the bill passes, it will move closer to becoming law, setting clear rules and oversight for the crypto market. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "SUI Reclaims Key Support With Strength — Is $2.35 The Next Target?",
    "body": "SUI is starting to show signs of renewed strength after reclaiming a critical high-timeframe support zone. Following a sharp selloff, the price has stabilized above this level, suggesting the downside deviation may be complete. As long as this base continues to hold, momentum could gradually build, putting the $2.35 zone firmly in focus as the next upside test. SUI Reclaims Critical HTF Support After Sharp Selloff Crypto analyst Scient, in a post on X, revealed that SUI’s recent price action is unfolding exactly where it should after the sharp selloff. The market has pushed back above a key high-timeframe (HTF) support zone that previously acted as an important pivot area. This reclaim suggests the brief move below support was a deviation rather than a structural breakdown, with price now beginning to stabilize and form a base. Related Reading: SUI Isn’t Done Yet: Weekly Accumulation Holds As Buyers Reload Below From a structural perspective, the grey box highlighted on the chart represents a crucial demand and decision zone. Holding above this area keeps the bullish reclaim intact and signals that buyers remain in control at higher timeframes. However, a move back below this zone would invalidate the setup and shift focus back toward downside risk, making this area pivotal for the next move. As long as SUI continues to hold and build acceptance above this base, Scient expects a steady grind higher toward the next resistance area around $2.35. A clean push into that zone could open the door for further expansion if momentum improves. Currently, this structure is appearing across multiple assets, with many charts printing similar high-timeframe PO3 accumulation patterns. Within that broader context, SUI stands out for reclaiming key support decisively, positioning it as one of the more constructive setups in the market. SUI Leads With Early 4H Trend Break According to an update by Daan Crypto Trades, SUI was one of the first major assets to break above its 4-hour downtrend and push decisively out of the prevailing range, signaling clear relative strength. This early breakout placed SUI ahead of many peers and put it on watch as a potential leader if broader conditions improve. Related Reading: SUI Climbs Into High-Risk Territory As Wave 4 Nears Its Exhaustion Point Currently, the price is consolidating directly on top of the former resistance area, a zone that now serves as key support. Holding this level would suggest a reclaim of the range and increase the likelihood of upward continuation. At the same time, a loss of this area would risk a return to consolidation and weaken the bullish structure. Overall, SUI continues to stand out as one of the stronger-looking majors, but the next leg higher still needs confirmation through renewed momentum. Although SUI’s progress remains closely linked to Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which are still lacking a clear direction. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "XRP Is At An Unique Moment In History: Developer Calls End Of Suppression",
    "body": "An XRP Ledger ecosystem developer behind the meme coin DROP is drawing attention after predicting a sharp shift in XRP’s relative value versus bitcoin this year, framing it as the start of a new “price discovery” phase for the token. Bird, who posts under @Bird_XRPL, wrote on X yesterday that “5,000 XRP will be worth 1 Bitcoin in 2026,” then clarified his math with a specific price path in mind. “I said I think 5,000 XRP will be worth 1 Bitcoin,” he added. “For example 5,000 * $27 (XRP) = $135K (BTC).” While the post reads like a headline-grabbing forecast, the structure of Bird’s claim is a ratio trade: XRP outperforming BTC enough that 5,000 XRP could purchase one bitcoin. By anchoring the example to $27 XRP and a $135,000 BTC, Bird effectively argued that the market’s next leg higher could involve a meaningful repricing of XRP’s utility narrative rather than a simple beta move to bitcoin. Related Reading: Get Ready For An XRP Price Explosion Once This Happens; Analyst XRP Entering ‘Price Discovery’ Phase The call arrived alongside a series of posts linking XRP’s setup to broader risk-asset conditions and upcoming US macro catalysts. Bird argued that “above $2.70 $XRP opens the path to all time highs and beyond,” presenting that level as a technical inflection point. “Take a breath. Stay present. Remember this moment,” he wrote. “This is the end of a 7–8 year suppression and the beginning of true price discovery.” Bird’s longer thesis, posted on Jan. 11, focused less on short-term trading and more on a personal allocation framework that treats XRP as a long-duration hold. “XRP should be considered as part of your life saving plans,” he wrote, contrasting bank deposit yields with inflation drag. Related Reading: Ripple Builds ‘Next Amazon’ With XRP At The Center, Says Crypto CEO “Most people keep their money in banks earning around 4–6% a year and feel comfortable doing so, but they rarely factor in inflation. Over time, the buying power of the US dollar and the British pound for example has fallen so much, meaning your money often grows on paper while quietly losing value in the real world.” He then positioned XRP as an alternative store of value tied to expanding usage rather than fiat purchasing power. “That’s where XRP comes in. XRP has spent years suppressed by legal uncertainty, yet during that time the technology continued to mature. Now we have clarity, and we can clearly see what’s being built,” Bird wrote, pointing to “cross border payments, institutional adoption, stablecoins like RLUSD, and real world assets being tokenised on chain.” Bird framed the trade-off as custody and counterparty risk versus upside participation. “That’s why I personally treat XRP as a long term savings vehicle rather than a short term trade,” he wrote. “You can self custody it, store it on a cold wallet, and remove reliance on banks altogether.” Bird also tied the timing of his forecast to what he described as a convergence of market structure and policy headlines. “It’s a massive week for XRP,” he wrote, citing CPI and PPI as volatility events and highlighting that the US market structure bill is scheduled to drop on Thursday. “The charts are aligning. The macro is aligned. If this pushes in our favour and we clear $2.70+, an all time high can come very fast for XRP people!” At press time, XRP traded at $2.06.
