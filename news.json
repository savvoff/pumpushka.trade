    "title": "What’s Driving The $1.42 Billion Comeback In Spot Bitcoin ETFs?",
    "body": "Fresh money poured back into US spot Bitcoin ETFs this week, giving the market a clear jolt after a quiet month. The inflows totaled about $1.42 billion, the biggest weekly pickup since early October. That rush pushed prices higher for a time and pulled a lot of attention back to these regulated funds. Related Reading: Saylor Defends Bitcoin Treasury Firms Amid Rising Criticism Institutional Demand Comes Back Reports say big, familiar investors are rejoining these funds. Managers with large pools of capital are using ETFs to get Bitcoin exposure in a way that fits standard rules and reporting. Some of the buying came through a tight set of funds that have wide reach with big clients. The move is being read as a return of steady, long-term money rather than quick speculative bets. Reports from the Bitcoin macro newsletter Ecoinometrics note that recent jumps in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows usually lead to brief price gains, which often disappear when the inflows ease. Based on data from SoSoValue, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw their biggest inflows midweek, with Wednesday bringing in more than $840 million in a single day and Tuesday following with roughly $754 million. Bitcoin doesn’t need a few good days. It needs a few good weeks. We’ve seen this pattern repeatedly: a short burst of ETF inflows, a quick price bounce, and then momentum fades. That tells us demand still exists, but it’s not persistent enough to change the trend. The chart… pic.twitter.com/6mkv7ye9fW — ecoinometrics (@ecoinometrics) January 16, 2026 BlackRock’s IBIT Tops Flows BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust drew the largest share of the gains. On several days it led all spot ETF flows, with one report showing IBIT accounted for roughly $1.03 billion of the weekly total. A single day during the run saw IBIT pull in amounts measured in the hundreds of millions, underlining how dominant the fund has become in the US market. When big, regulated vehicles buy a lot of Bitcoin, the effect is not just on paper. These ETFs must either create new shares by buying coins or choose to source supply elsewhere. That process removes coins from the pool available to regular traders. At the same time, some data show that large holders eased off selling in recent days, which tightened the coins ready to trade even more. The mix of fresh demand and less selling can lift price quickly. Short Gains, Or The Start Of Something Longer? Some market watchers point out that a single week of big inflows is only part of the picture. Patterns matter. If monthly flows stay strong, then the story is clearer. If the money fades, prices can fall back just as fast. Still, the sudden inflow shows that at least a group of big investors prefers regulated ETF exposure right now. That matters for how traditional funds think about Bitcoin in balanced portfolios.

Reports say the price steadied after a small bounce from recent lows. Some updates show Bitcoin briefly rising above $96,800, shaking out short-term traders. Analysts note the swings reflect mixed sentiment, with the market unsure of the next clear direction. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Long Signal That Preceded 370% Move Is About To Go Off Again — What To Know",
    "body": "Going into the weekend, the price of Bitcoin was unable to sustain the bullish momentum it displayed earlier in the past week. Since Friday, January 16th, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, repudiated by the price resistance above, now trades in a tight consolidatory bracket. Interestingly, this period of silence has been deemed transient, as recent on-chain data suggests an exciting time ahead for the BTC price. Kimchi Premium Flips Positive As Local Demand Sees Buildup In a January 17 post on the X platform, DeFi asset management platform XWIN Finance released an on-chain report, which suggests that Bitcoin might be closer to reaching a turning point than is apparent in its price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $100K: Why All Eyes Are On The Short-Term Holders This hypothesis is based on the Bitcoin Kimchi Premium indicator. This measures the percentage difference between a cryptocurrency’s price (in this case, Bitcoin) on South Korean exchanges and its price on global exchanges. Simply put, it shows how much more Korean traders are willing to pay for Bitcoin. When the Kimchi Premium transitions steadily from low or negative levels to cross above historically significant levels, this is typically viewed as a long signal from the metric. This interpretation is because a rising Kimchi Premium reflects growing local demand in South Korea, usually often influenced by retail buyers. In essence, Korean buyers are willing to pay more for Bitcoin, hence overwhelming the available supply and consequently pushing prices upwards. In the post on X, XWIN Finance highlighted that this long signal had been sighted on the indicator. History also attests to the bullish significance of this signal; there have been major price moves to the upside following sustained increases in the Kimchi Premium. An example is the last sighting of the long signal in October 2023, where the index rose above a major threshold, as shown in the chart above. The price of Bitcoin witnessed a 370% rally after this signal went off in 2023. According to XWIN Research, this same pattern seems to be playing out again in 2026. Hence, if the Kimchi Premium completes its long-signal formation, it could be a sign that buyers are occupying favourable positions for a bullish ride. If history does repeat itself, the Bitcoin price could be on track to witness another exciting voyage, with the flagship cryptocurrency possibly putting in a more than 300% surge in the next cycle. However, it is worth noting that macro conditions, institutional demand, and derivatives activity would be playing their roles to augment the pattern’s plausibility, as it should not be viewed as a standalone bullish sign. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $95,280, reflecting no significant change in the past 24 hours.

    "title": "Ethereum Network Activity Explodes, Market Structure Points To Upside Continuation",
    "body": "Ethereum is showing signs of strength on two critical fronts at the same time. On-chain activity has climbed to record levels, reflecting heavier real usage across the network, while long-term technical structure is leaning towards upside continuation. Together, these signals suggest that Ethereum’s current phase may be more than just sideways movement, as underlying data points to sustained demand and constructive price behavior. Related Reading: Saylor Defends Bitcoin Treasury Firms Amid Rising Criticism Ethereum Daily Transactions Reach New High Ethereum’s price action is turning bullish with a steady increase in recent days. Notably, on-chain data shows that this increase is on top of steady on-chain activity in recent days. Data from Ethereum’s on-chain activity shows that daily transactions recently climbed to approximately 2.8 million, setting a new all-time high for the network. Interestingly, this figure stands out not just as a record, but because it is roughly 64% higher than the daily transaction levels observed during the peak of the 2021 bull market. The chart data from Sentora illustrates a progression showing Ethereum’s transaction count rising steadily over the years and spiking up in early 2026. Comparing the transaction activity to 2021 adds more context considering the intense amount of activity that the Ethereum network was witnessing at the time. Back then, Ethereum was at the center of an altcoin season and NFT boom, all of which contributed to a spike in transaction activity and a push to new price highs. The fact that Ethereum is now processing significantly more transactions per day compared to 2021 shows that its network usage has grown above speculative behavior. The steady climb in transaction activity shows the sheer amount of usage across decentralized finance and stablecoin settlement, among many others. Ethereum Daily Transactions Chart. Source: @SentoraHQ On X Ethereum Reaccumulation Within A Macro Uptrend Technical analysis of Ethereum’s market capitalization on the three-week candlestick timeframe shows the cryptocurrency is still trading in a zone of stability. Particularly, technical analysis done by crypto analyst Egrag Crypto suggests that Ethereum is in reaccumulation within a macro uptrend. A look at the 3-week timeframe shows that ETH’s market cap is holding above the 21 EMA, respecting the rising macro trendline, printing higher highs & higher lows, and compressing under historical resistance. That is constructive behavior, not weakness. History shows that periods where Ethereum’s market cap held above the 21 EMA on this timeframe have led to expansion phases, whereas sustained moves below it have marked bear market conditions. Related Reading: What’s Driving The $1.42 Billion Comeback In Spot Bitcoin ETFs? At present, the structure indicates the EMA support is being defended. From a probabilistic standpoint, the current setup leans toward continuation rather than breakdown. A move through the overhead resistance band would likely confirm an expansion phase and allow Ethereum to go on a 70% to 75% bullish continuation. Market Cap ETH. Source: @egragcrypto On X On the other hand, a bearish outcome will become possible if the price action loses the 21 EMA on the three-week chart. This could validate a deeper 25% to 30% correction toward the lower trendline, but this scenario carries a lower probability. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "More XRP Than Cash? “You’re A Genius”, Analyst Says",
    "body": "A sharp comment from a well-known XRP Ledger developer has sparked fresh debate around savings, inflation, and what smart money looks like today. Related Reading: What’s Driving The $1.42 Billion Comeback In Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Bird, the developer behind the XRPL-based meme coin DROP, drew attention after saying that anyone holding more value in XRP than in their bank account is a “genius.” The word choice was bold, and it quickly spread across social media, pulling in both supporters and critics. Genius Or Gamble In An Inflation Era According to Bird, the label has less to do with bragging rights and more to do with awareness. He argues that many people trust banks by default, assuming savings accounts protect their future. The problem, he says, is math. Savings rates around 4–6% often fail to keep pace with rising prices. Groceries, rent, transport, and healthcare keep climbing. Over time, money sitting still can quietly lose strength. In that light, Bird frames holding XRP as a sign of foresight rather than recklessness. If you have more money in $XRP than in your bank account, you’re a genius. — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 11, 2026 Risk Still Has A Price XRP prices can swing hard in short periods, something banks are built to avoid. A savings account may feel boring, but it offers stability and fast access when bills arrive or emergencies hit. That difference matters. Long-term holders respond that XRP was never meant to act like a checking account. It is treated as an asset tied to future payment rails and global transfers, not day-to-day spending money. The “genius” remark, they say, speaks to time horizon, not short-term comfort. Utility Gains After Years Of Pressure XRP spent years weighed down by legal uncertainty while its network continued to expand behind the scenes. With parts of that pressure easing, attention has shifted back to usage. Cross-border payments remain a core focus. Stablecoin activity, including RLUSD, has increased. Tokenization of real-world assets is also being explored on the XRP Ledger. Supporters believe this growing use gives XRP value beyond price charts. “ What’s the right amount of $XRP to hold? “ The truth is… it’s completely subjective. We all live in different countries, have different costs, jobs, savings, families, goals. Some people chase money, some chase freedom. Some need security for health, travel, retirement,… https://t.co/A5g5Oa4f7c — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 10, 2026 How Much Is Enough Depends On You Bird has also raised a question that keeps coming up online: what amount of XRP is “right.” Reports note he often mentions 10,000 XRP as a rough reference, not a target. His thinking is simple. If XRP ever trades in double digits, that holding turns into a six-figure sum in US dollars. For some people, that could mean freedom. For others, it might only ease pressure. Living costs, family size, health needs, and location all shape what “enough” really means.

    "body": "Dogecoin started a fresh decline below the $0.1320 zone against the US Dollar. DOGE is now consolidating losses and might face hurdles near $0.1350. DOGE price started a fresh decline below the $0.1250 level. The price is trading below the $0.130 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1350 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could extend losses if it stays below $0.1300 and $0.1350. Dogecoin Price Dives Below Support Dogecoin price started a fresh decline after it closed below $0.1350, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE declined below the $0.1300 and $0.1250 support levels. The price even traded below $0.120. A low was formed near $0.1154, and the price is now showing bearish signs. There was a recovery wave above $0.1220. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1512 swing high to the $0.1154 low. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.130 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a recovery wave, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.130 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.1330 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1512 swing high to the $0.1154 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.1350 level and trend line. A close above the $0.1350 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1380 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.140 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1420. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1300 level, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1250 level. The next major support is near the $0.1220 level. The main support sits at $0.120. If there is a downside break below the $0.120 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.1150 level or even $0.1135 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level.

    "title": "XRP Is Doing Something It Hasn’t Done Since 2021: Here’s Why It Matters",
    "body": "XRP is flashing a rare relative-strength signal against ETH, according to crypto analyst Matt Hughes (“The Great Mattsby”), who points to a 2-week Ichimoku cloud flip that he says hasn’t meaningfully held as support since 2021. With XRP also boxed inside a defined USD range on lower timeframes, Hughes frames the next phase as a conditional “prove it” moment: reclaim one level, and the market has room to work; fail it, and the breakout narrative stays premature. XRP Poised To Outperform ETH? Hughes’ primary claim is anchored to the XRP/ETH pair on a 2-week chart. In his read, there’s a massive regime change: “When looking at the 2-week Ichimoku cloud, you can see that XRP is doing something it hasn’t done since 2021: flipping the 2-week cloud to support. The cloud has been a massive resistance for most of the chart’s history until now (with a notable breakout in 2021, but only a few weeks).” On Hughes’ chart, XRP/ETH is pressing into the top side of the 2-week Ichimoku cloud, with the latest candle marked around 0.00062. His bullish read is that a clean flip, price holding above the cloud and treating it as a floor on pullbacks, would be a regime change for the pair. XRP Roadmap To $9 Hughes’ shorter-timeframe work shifts from relative performance to mechanics in spot USD terms. On the daily XRP/USD chart, price is still behaving like a market that has not resolved its larger consolidation, oscillating between stacked horizontal levels while respecting sloping fan lines that visually reinforce why upside attempts have repeatedly stalled. Related Reading: XRP To Repeat Its 2017 Playbook? Analyst Forecasts 1,250% Expansion Hughes boils that structure down to one actionable threshold: “Price moves in increments, and this Gann fan perfectly illustrates why price is stuck in its current range. Once XRP can close candles above $2.30, the move up can continue.” Above that, the next targets on the daily timeframe are $2.59 and $2.95. The weekly XRP/USD chart adds the next level if that acceptance arrives. Two extension levels (drawn from the 2014 low to the 2017 high) are explicitly marked: 2.272 at $3.09882 and 2.618 at $9.00194, with Hughes’ drawn path stepping first toward the low-$3 area before stretching higher if momentum persists. Related Reading: Surge In XRP Transactions: 1.45 Million Daily Users Could Signal Price Rally Ahead, Says Expert Thus, Hughes’ bullish scenario is a two-part sequence: first, clear the USD range trigger (a sustained close above $2.30), then convert the last major zone before the 2025 high into support. He states it in more pointed terms on X: “XRP’s been grinding sideways for 1+ year while many other alts were bleeding. Not IF it hits $9—it’s WHEN. Key flip: $3.09 becomes support and then its go time.” The failure scenario is simpler and more immediate. If XRP cannot secure closes above $2.30, the fan-and-range framework remains intact: rallies are still just rallies into the same ceiling, and the market risks reverting back towards $1.78. However, a dip towards this price would not change anything about the long-term bullish chart of XRP. Pointing to a gap between chart structure and crowd sentiment, Hughes wrote: “An actual infant in diapers and a 120-year-old grandpa who’s forgotten his own name can look at this chart and go, ‘Yep, classic breakout above the 2021 top, now flipping it to rock-solid support.’ Meanwhile, every bear on X, their mailman, their mailman’s dog walker, and that one guy who still thinks it’s 2022 are out here screaming ‘BEARISH! DOOM! SELL YOUR KIDS!’ like it’s still the bear market special. Bro, even my grandma’s bingo partner is bullish at this point. Wake up and smell the bull fuel.” At press time, XRP traded at $1.9799.

    "title": "Bitcoin Bulls Fired Up As Saylor Teases ‘Bigger Orange’ After Huge Buy",
    "body": "Michael Saylor’s hint about a “Bigger Orange” has sent fresh energy through parts of the Bitcoin market. It came after Strategy executed a very large buy, and traders took the message as a sign there may be more accumulation ahead. Short bursts of buying have a way of changing tone on trading floors. Related Reading: What’s Driving The $1.42 Billion Comeback In Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Saylor Signals New Buying Spree According to reports, Strategy purchased more than $1.25 billion in Bitcoin in its latest move, adding thousands of coins to its holdings. That stack has pushed the company closer to a massive total that some sources put near 700,000 BTC. Markets reacted quickly. Prices nudged higher in the hours after the news, and shares of Strategy were treated by some investors as a way to get extra Bitcoin exposure. Traders Pounced And Charts Reacted Momentum traders were the first to lean in. They saw the buy as proof that a major corporate buyer still sees value in stacking coins during dips. Options desks showed increased call buying, and volume spiked on spot desks in New York and Asia. Sentiment grew more positive, but caution remained. Big buys can lift short-term prices, yet they don’t always start long, steady rallies. ₿igger Orange. pic.twitter.com/HI47hMCnui — Michael Saylor (@saylor) January 18, 2026 Market Reaction And Investor Moves Retail and institutional players both turned their attention to liquidity. Reports note that when one large buyer moves, other firms often reassess their risk and allocation plans. Hedge funds checked their models. Family offices ran fresh numbers. For some investors, the appeal is simple: owning a scarce asset that an influential buyer keeps adding to can feel reassuring. Corporate Treasuries And Public Perception Corporate cash strategies have been in the spotlight since Strategy first started buying coins. CEOs and boards watch those moves closely, and investors watch boards. For a public company to keep buying, confidence has to be high enough to risk press questions and regulatory attention. That choice is being watched by analysts who say such buys shape public debate about Bitcoin’s role as part of a company’s balance sheet. What Analysts Are Watching Analysts are tracking three things: how many coins are being taken off exchanges, whether accumulation is steady or one-off, and how the market digests more large purchases. On-chain trackers showed notable withdrawals after the reported purchase, which can tighten available supply. Some onlookers cautioned that short-term price jumps can be reversed if selling follows or if macro news turns sour.

Still, outcomes are far from certain. Buying by a major corporate holder can shift sentiment and squeeze short positions, but markets are shaped by many forces at once. For now, traders, investors, and watchers will keep an eye on any follow-up moves and how price and liquidity respond in the next sessions. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "XRP Price Could Surge Another 30% If This Trend Is Confirmed",
    "body": "Crypto analyst ChartNerd has raised the possibility of the XRP price recording another 30% surge from its current level. This comes even as the altcoin risks erasing its year-to-date (YTD) gains due to the recent crypto market crash. How The XRP Price Could Rally To $2.70 In an X post, ChartNerd stated that a potential XRP price rally to $2.70 is a possibility in the near term if the altcoin can hold the Fib support targets and mark a higher low. He highlighted three Fib support levels, including the 0.5 at $2, 0.618 at $1.99, and 0.786 at $1.89. He noted that the $2.70 was the base of the descending triangle, around the area where XRP broke down from following the October 10 crypto crash last year. Related Reading: XRP Wave C Push On The Way: What Could Send Price Below $2? ChartNerd also explained that the XRP price was currently in a falling wedge breakout pattern and that this typically leads to rallies as high as where the coin had broken down. As such, in this case, XRP could reach the descending triangle resistance at $2.70. The crypto analyst had also highlighted bullish fundamentals that could drive the rally toward this target. This includes Ripple’s alleged ties to South Korea’s tokenized infrastructure and projected major expansion for XRP. However, it is worth mentioning that the XRP price is also at risk of a further decline amid the latest crypto market crash, led by Bitcoin. BTC has dropped to as low as $92,000 in the last 24 hours, forcing XRP to crash below the psychological $2 level. This crash has occurred on the back of the latest Trump tariffs on some European nations over the U.S. proposed takeover of Greenland. The EU is weighing retaliatory tariffs, which could escalate this into another full-blown trade war. The Crash Could Be A “Blessing In Disguise” In another X post, ChartNerd suggested that the recent XRP price crash could be a blessing in disguise. This came as the analyst alluded to the $1.80 liquidity pocket on the monthly heatmap. He noted that this latest drawdown has swept the altcoin into that exact sell-side liquidity, a move which ChartNerd described as a clarity response. ChartNerd also suggested that the XRP price is likely a minor setback rather than a major retracement. He noted that although altcoins are taking hefty hits, Bitcoin hasn’t lost any key structure and that all he sees is “opportunity” until the trendline is invalidated. As such, XRP could see a bounce if BTC successfully defends this trendline.
