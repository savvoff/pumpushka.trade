    "title": "Bitcoin Price Hits Crash Line, But This Time Is Not Random",
    "body": "According to a new technical analysis, the Bitcoin price has returned to its “Crash Line,” fueling talk of a possible bullish turnaround. The expert behind this analysis has suggested that this is not a random event, but a deliberate move that could signal the beginning of Bitcoin’s next upward move. Bitcoin Price Revisits Familiar Crash Line In a recent post on X, market analyst Crypto Tice announced that Bitcoin has just hit the Crash Line, a level that has repeatedly acted as a critical reload point during the current bull cycle. The analyst indicated that this trendline has historically led to strong price rallies for BTC. He observed that throughout the bull market, Bitcoin has consistently followed the same sequence each time the price returns to the Crash Line. Related Reading: Crypto Market Watches As Clarity Act Enters Senate Debate Next Week: US Senator The process begins with momentum overheating, meaning buyers push prices up too quickly, creating unsustainable upward pressure. As this momentum builds, excessive leverage accumulates in the market, followed by a sharp correction. This price decline often brings Bitcoin back to the Crash Line. From this point, BTC usually starts gearing up for its next expansion phase. Crypto Tice shared a weekly chart illustrating this pattern. Each time Bitcoin approached the Crash Line, its price corrected by about 33.10% and 30.97% before quickly surging higher. Now that Bitcoin has returned to the Crash Line after a recent 33.38% drop, the analyst suggested it could follow the same historical trend and launch a major rally. Crypto Tice also noted that the Crash Line has consistently marked leverage flushes, selling-pressure exhaustion, and trend continuation zones for Bitcoin. Rather than signaling structural weakness, the analyst said this trendline has acted as a transition point. He noted that if the broader structure remains intact, the Crash Line could mark the area where Bitcoin’s upside reloads. Analyst Predicts Next Possible Moves For Bitcoin In a separate X post, market expert Crypto King said that Bitcoin is currently “stuck in a no trading zone,” meaning that the market still lacks a clear direction despite its recent rebound above $90,000. The analyst added that BTC’s liquidity and market participation are drying up, particularly as price moves sideways and the risk of getting caught in false moves increases. As a result, Crypto King has outlined two possible scenarios for Bitcoin. If the cryptocurrency can push above $92,000 and hold that level, he expects it to flip from resistance into support.

The analyst has highlighted two potential demand zones on the chart: one around the CME gap and another extending lower between $60,000 and $50,000.

    "title": "Analyst Sets $105K As Next Bitcoin Price Target — Here’s The Timeline",
    "body": "After a fairly optimistic start to the new year, the Bitcoin price might finally be ready to take off, as revealed by a market analyst. The pundit believes that the flagship cryptocurrency can reclaim its six-figure valuation over the next few weeks, particularly as a key technical indicator has turned bullish. Why BTC Price Could Be Headed For $105,000 In Three Weeks In a January 9 post on the social media platform X, pseudonymous crypto pundit Bitbull shared a positive outlook for the Bitcoin price in the coming weeks. According to the crypto analyst, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could return to around $103,000 and $105,000 in the next three to four weeks. Related Reading: Cathie Wood: Trump May Buy Bitcoin For US Reserve Ahead Of Midterms This optimistic prediction is based on changes in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the Bitcoin weekly chart. The relative strength index is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis to assess the magnitude and speed of an asset’s price changes. The RSI oscillator typically analyzes whether a crypto asset (Bitcoin, in this case) is being overbought or oversold, suggesting a possible price or trend reversal. When the relative strength index rises above 70, it usually suggests an overbought market condition, with the asset’s price likely to witness a bearish reversal. On the other hand, an RSI value below the 30 mark means that the market is oversold, with the price potentially reaching a bottom. BitBull revealed that the Bitcoin weekly RSI has been in an extended decline in the past three months and has only just broken above the downward trend line. According to the market pundit, the technical indicator is signaling further upside for the Bitcoin price. As observed in the chart above, the price of Bitcoin went on a significant rally the last time the weekly RSI broke out of a downward trend. This breakout last occurred in April 2025, preceding BTC’s rally to its current all-time high of $126,080, representing an almost 50% surge. This time around, BitBull expects the Bitcoin price to rise to between $103,000 and $105,000 in the course of the next three to four weeks. Hitting this target would represent an approximately 15% rally from the current price point. Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, the price of BTC sits around $90,600, reflecting an almost 1% decline in the past 24 hours. While the premier cryptocurrency made a strong start to the year, the market has since cooled down. The Bitcoin price has been mostly hovering around the $90,000 mark, with only a few runs above $91,000 in the past week. According to data from TradingView, the BTC price is up by 3% so far in 2026.

    "body": "XRP is now back to trading just above the $2 level after an early January rally briefly carried its price action into the $2.40 range. The pullback has so far been controlled, with price holding above former resistance that has now turned into short-term support. A technical analysis shared on X by crypto analyst Bird proposed that conditions are now right for a familiar macro setup that has preceded XRP’s largest historical rallies. The focus of this outlook is on XRP’s reaction with the US dollar index and what its next move could mean for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Crypto Market Watches As Clarity Act Enters Senate Debate Next Week: US Senator How DXY Weakness Has Always Unlocked XRP Rallies Bird’s analysis is based on the US Dollar Index, or DXY, and its inverse relationship with XRP during important phases. The chart accompanying his post pointed to three previous periods, around 2017, 2021, and 2024, where sustained weakness in the dollar coincided with aggressive upside moves in XRP. In each of those cycles, red candles on the DXY chart led to a loss of dollar strength, while XRP responded with strong upward expansion shortly after. This recurring pattern means that XRP’s largest moves tend to follow macro shifts, not just even events related to XRP. When dollar dominance fades, capital always rotates into crypto assets, and XRP has been one of the primary beneficiaries of that transition. Interestingly, the current setup shows that DXY has returned to a similar structural zone seen before past rollovers. As shown in the chart below, the DXY is now trending downwards. US Dollar Index, XRPUSD. Source: @Bird_XRPL On X XRP To New All-Time Highs? The first highlighted phase captures the late-2017 to early-2018 cycle, when a weakening dollar backdrop lined up with XRP’s rally run into the cycle peak in the mid-$3 range. A similar relationship appeared around the 2020-2021 window, where dollar softness was followed by XRP surging to $1.90 at its cycle top. The latest was in H1 2025, which culminated in XRP reaching its current all-time high of $3.65 in July. The important context is why the current moment is a decision point. At the time of writing, the DXY is sitting around 99, and from here it can either turn lower and start printing red candles again or catch a bid and print green. If DXY starts printing red candles again and rolls over, the pattern Bird is pointing to suggests the macro backdrop becomes supportive for another strong XRP leg higher, which is why a new all-time high above $3.65 could come into view within the next few months. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator If DXY prints green and strengthens, that would be the opposite signal: it can tighten liquidity conditions and keep XRP’s price action capped in consolidation around $2 before any breakout attempt. Either way, the dollar’s next move will signal what comes next. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "Bitcoin continues to hover within the $90,000 price range, producing no significant price movement in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, a subtle on-chain development is indicating a potential change in market trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Is Not In At $126,000, According To The Business Cycle, Here’s Why STH SOPR Above 1 — Bullish Rebound Or Fakeout? The Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR) is a key on-chain metric that judges investors’ sentiment. In definition, the STH-SOPR measures whether Bitcoin holders are presently selling their assets at a loss or at a profit. According to pseudonymous analyst CryptoMe, this important on-chain metric has recently flashed an eye-catching signal that could imply a trend reversal following months of deep market corrections. Notably, Bitcoin slipped into a prolonged downtrend in early October, after establishing its current all-time high at $126,100. On October 10, which represents the initial phase of this price correction, CryptoMe states the STH-SOPR fell below 1.0 in line with its natural behavior. As seen in the image above, the Bitcoin STH-SOPR stays below 1.0 during bear seasons to indicate that BTC holders are exiting at a loss. During this period, it is also observed that 1.0 midline acts as an effective resistance, restricting upward STH-SOPR movement to signal that the market structure remains weak. Alternatively, in bullish markets, the STH-SOPR moves above 1.0, which becomes a strong price floor provided a buy-side dominance remains. According to CryptoMe, this latter positive scenario has occurred in the past week, marking the first instance after October 10. In line with standard interpretation, CryptoMe explains that this recent development represents a new hope for a possible trend reversal if the STH-SOPR sustains its move above the 1.0 threshold. Notably, an opposite case would suggest a fake-out and possibly reinforce existing bearish market sentiments. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maintains Mid-$90k Levels: Possible Price Targets — Analyst Bitcoin Market Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $90,590, after a negligible 0.13% gain in the past 24 hours. However, its daily trading volume is down by 66.41% and valued at $13.38 billion. This suggests that market participation is fading out amid a sustained consolidation. In terms of a potential breakout, emerging market catalysts suggest an equal potential for the price to swing in either direction. For example, the odds of the Federal Open Market Committee implementing a rate cut have dropped drastically from 95% to 5%. Following recent predictions, the policy committee is likely to hold the rates steady, which may draw out a possible negative reaction from Bitcoin. On the other hand, regulatory developments in the US are shaping up positively. Most notably, the Clarity Act has been slated for a markup session, indicating progress toward regulatory clarity that could encourage further institutional and retail investment.

    "title": "Ethereum’s Inverted Chart May Be Setting Up Its Next Major Move: New ATH Soon?",
    "body": "Ethereum’s price action has spent an unusually long time moving sideways, and this behavior has tested the patience of many long-term bullish investors. When speaking of sideways movement, this movement has dragged on for many months, although Ethereum did manage to make a new all-time high in 2025. Interestingly, a technical analysis shared on X by Egrag Crypto shows how Ethereum’s current price action fits into previous playouts when viewed through an inverted monthly chart. This offers a perspective on what appears to be stagnation about to break into new price highs.

Ethereum’s inverted monthly chart shows a consistent pattern that’s changing with time in market structure across multiple cycles. A look at the inverted chart shows that previous price cycles were characterized by short accumulation phases followed by aggressive moves. As the market matured, those accumulation zones stretched out, and the resulting moves became less violent and more controlled. The first instance was in 2016, when Ethereum traded in a range for about 10 months before breaking out and going on a violent drop. A similar structure appeared between mid-2018 and mid-2020, when a longer consolidation phase preceded another drop that played out gradually at a softer pace. The current cycle, however, is playing out with a much longer accumulation. Therefore, the eventual drop should be shorter, according to Egrag Crypto. Inverted Ethereum Price Chart. Source: @egragcrypto on X A Drop Here Actually Means A Breakout The most important detail in this technical framework is that the chart is inverted. What looks like a downside move on this view actually points to upside expansion on the real Ethereum price chart. According to the previous outcomes, once Ethereum exits this range, the next move is likely to unfold quickly. It may not match the explosive nature of early-cycle rallies, but it is expected to be more orderly, sustained, and carry Ethereum to new price highs. When the structure is converted back into real price terms, Egrag Crypto identifies the $3,800 to $4,500 area as the first critical zone. This region represents initial resistance that must be cleared to confirm a bullish continuation. Only after a decisive move above this range would the $6,000 to $7,500 zone come into focus as a realistic upside target.

A pullback to the $1,800 to $2,200 region would postpone the breakout and act as a final shakeout before a final lift-off. However, as long as Ethereum holds its broader consolidation structure, such a retest would not invalidate the thesis. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,100.
