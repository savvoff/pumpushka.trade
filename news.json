    "title": "XRP Price At $10,000 Is Not A Prophecy: Analyst Shares Simple Framework That Points Higher",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Luke has declared that an XRP price rally to $10,000 is not a prophecy, but one that can indeed happen. He shared a framework that breaks down the factors that could drive the altcoin’s rally toward this ambitious target. Analyst Shares Framework For XRP Price Rally To $10,000 In an X post, Luke stated that an XRP price target of $10,000 is ot a target or prophecy but a thought experiment. He further noted that Ripple is building the infrastructure that makes this outcome possible for the altcoin. The analyst then provided the “simple framework” on how XRP will reach this $10,000 price target. Related Reading: Pundit Explains Why The XRP Price Hitting $100 Isn’t Delusional First, he predicted that the XRP price would reach between $10 and $25 when liquidity rotates, not because fundamentals had changed, but because attention had shifted. Luke stated that altcoin cycles still exist and that speculation still moves first. Furthermore, the analyst predicts that XRP will reach $100 once the altcoin is used rather than discussed. This utility will come in the form of repeatedly serving as the bridge currency for cross-border transactions. When this happens, Luke believes that velocity begins to matter and that idle liquidity becomes a liability. The next part of the framework is the XRP price rally to $1,000, which the analyst stated will happen when financial infrastructure assumes XRP is there. In this phase, he envisions a scenario in which XRP becomes the backbone of global finance, with no workarounds or substitutes. Luke said that at this stage, the system relies heavily on XRP, as removing the altcoin would break the system. He added that the price will reflect dependency, not belief. The final part of the framework is the XRP price rally to $10,000, which he claimed would occur when global capital moves under pressure, prefunding fails at scale, and speed, certainty, and liquidity are non-negotiable. Another Pundit Shares XRP Thesis Crypto pundit BarriC, who has always predicted that the XRP price could reach $10,000, has shared his thesis on what will happen as the altcoin rallies to as high as $1 million. He stated that XRP at $2 equals retail speculation, while a $10 price target is early utility and liquidity growth. At $100 per XRP, the analyst believes that institutional usage will begin to matter. Related Reading: Analyst Says All Conditions Are In Place For XRP, Here’s What It Means Furthermore, BarriC stated that large-scale settlements will reduce the required supply, with the XRP price at $1,000. Meanwhile, the analyst noted that fewer units will be needed to move massive value when the altcoin reaches $10,000. He also predicted that XRP could reach $1 million, noting that at this stage, efficiency will exceed abundance. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.86, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "XRP Prints Bullish Divergence On The Weekly Chart, But Is ATHs Still Possible?",
    "body": "After months of compressed price action, XRP is back in focus after a widely followed crypto trader on X highlighted a significant shift on the weekly chart. The asset is now showing a technical signal that has historically appeared near major turning points, sparking debate over whether this setup can realistically support a move back toward XRP’s prior all-time highs. XRP’s Multi-Year Range Holds As Bullish Momentum Emerges The crypto trader notes that XRP’s current market structure remains anchored to a clearly defined weekly price range that dates back to the 2018 cycle peak. This long-standing zone, stretching roughly from the low-$2 area to the low-$3 region, has functioned as a structural equilibrium for XRP across multiple market phases. Since late 2024, XRP’s price has stayed compressed within this range, repeatedly testing both support and resistance without delivering a decisive breakout or breakdown. Related Reading: What’s Going On With The US Dollar And How Does It Affect Bitcoin, Ethereum Prices? What differentiates the current setup from previous failures is the behavior of momentum. On recent weekly lows, momentum indicators have begun forming higher lows even as price revisits familiar support levels. In practical terms, downside moves are losing strength, signaling that selling pressure is weakening. This bullish divergence suggests distribution is fading, with sellers expending more effort for diminishing downside results. The chart shared by the trader reinforces this view, showing price holding range support while underlying momentum trends higher. From a structural perspective, this consolidation reflects absorption rather than weakness. Short-term participants are gradually replaced by longer-term holders, improving market stability. While a bullish divergence alone does not guarantee a return to all-time highs, it reopens that discussion in a technically credible way. A sustained breakout above the upper boundary of this multi-year range would be the key confirmation. Until that occurs, ATHs remain a conditional outcome—but the divergence signals that the groundwork for such a move may now be forming. Macro Rotation And The Case For A Delayed Altcoin Catch-Up The broader market context reinforces the significance of the trader’s weekly XRP analysis. Equities continue to reach record highs, metals are losing momentum, and the US dollar is falling—conditions that historically signal capital rotation. Yet, many altcoins, including XRP, remain sidelined in sentiment, largely overlooked after underperforming relative to newer narratives. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Forecasts 72.86% Crash To $30,000 According to the crypto trader, this disconnect is notable: altcoins still trade well above bear-market lows, but cautious positioning creates the potential for asymmetric gains if capital rotates from crowded trades. The bullish divergence on XRP’s weekly chart does not guarantee an immediate rally or automatic return to all-time highs. However, it signals that structural groundwork for a larger move is forming. If XRP can reclaim and break above the upper boundary of its multi-year range with conviction, the case for revisiting previous peaks becomes materially stronger. This setup reflects temporary frustration, not failure. Momentum is building, and while patience is required, the chart suggests the market is positioning correctly for a potential delayed catch-up in the altcoin sector.

    "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) continued to slide on Thursday, extending the downward trend seen throughout the week and briefly falling below the closely watched $85,000 level, despite progress on long-awaited US crypto legislation failing to lift market sentiment. Crypto Prices Fall Despite Regulatory Progress The decline came on the same day the Senate Agriculture Committee advanced its portion of the proposed crypto market structure legislation, known as the CLARITY Act. While the committee’s action was widely viewed as a positive development for the digital asset industry, it did little to support prices in the short term. Related Reading: White House To Host Crypto And Banking Leaders In Push To Break Regulatory Deadlock Instead of triggering a rally, the news coincided with a sharp market sell‑off. Bitcoin dropped by roughly $2,700 in a short period, setting off a wave of liquidations that erased an estimated $356 million in long positions. Data from Coinglass further shows that total liquidations across the crypto market reached about $803 million over the past 24 hours, including roughly $693 million in long liquidations and $109 million in short liquidations. Bitcoin Hovers Near Breakdown Levels As earlier reported by Bitcoinist, the CLARITY Act cleared an important procedural hurdle earlier on Thursday when the Senate Agriculture Committee approved its section of the bill during a scheduled markup. The legislation aims to establish a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. With the Agriculture Committee’s approval secured, lawmakers must merge the provisions that expand the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) role with parallel sections overseen by the Senate Banking Committee, which address the Securities and Exchange Commission’s jurisdiction. At the same time, legislators will need to determine whether bipartisan backing can still be achieved for a measure that could significantly reshape crypto regulation in the US. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Begins To Rise, Raising Early Bear Market Concerns From a technical perspective, market analyst Rekt Capital said that in the near term, Bitcoin needs to prevent the former range low around $86,000 from turning into resistance on lower time frames. He added that a weekly close above that level would be necessary to avoid a deeper breakdown. According to his analysis, a decisive break below the roughly $86,000 area could open the door to another test of the macro triangle bottom near $82,500. A further drop below that level, he cautioned, would signal an acceleration of bearish momentum. As of now, the market’s leading cryptocurrency has only briefly recovered to $85,135. However, it is still far from reaching the critical level outlined by the analyst. Therefore, Friday’s price action will be crucial in determining Bitcoin’s next move.

    "title": "Dogecoin Price Could Continue To Decline If This Doesn’t Happen; Analyst",
    "body": "The Dogecoin price is facing renewed pressure as market watchers warn the meme coin may not be out of the woods yet. A crypto analyst warns that unless Dogecoin meets certain key conditions, its ongoing weakness could trigger another price crash, further extending its bearish trend. Dogecoin Price Could Extend Downtrend Like many meme coins, Dogecoin is experiencing a major downturn after failing to break key resistance levels. This continuous rejection has kept selling pressure intact and prevented the DOGE price from building sustained upward momentum. As a result, Dogecoin’s bearish structure, which has been in place for months, shows few signs of relief. Bulls are also facing major roadblocks, leaving Dogecoin vulnerable to further declines so long as it trades below key levels. Related Reading: What’s Going On With The US Dollar And How Does It Affect Bitcoin, Ethereum Prices? According to crypto market expert KrissPax, Dogecoin remains weak and could extend its already intense downtrend if its price fails to recover. He explained that without a solid bullish catalyst to drive the price upward, the meme coin could experience another price crash. KrissPax presented a TradingView chart showing just how far he believes Dogecoin could decline if it fails to recapture market interest and demand. Firstly, the chart highlights a higher-timeframe descending channel pattern that began after the broader market flash crash on October 10, 2025. At the time, Dogecoin recorded one of its largest single-day price crashes, falling from above $0.26 to below $0.10 before quickly recovering. Following that steep decline, Dogecoin price remained stuck in the descending channel, with its overall structure reflecting a bearish trend. Typically, a descending channel pattern favors more downside pressure unless a decisive breakout occurs. So far, Dogecoin has made a few recovery attempts; however, its price has failed to sustain any bullish rally. Recent price action, as shown in the chart, also indicates consolidation near the lower to middle part of the channel, with a gradual base forming around $0.12-$0.14. For now, a clear break below the lower trendline of the channel would confirm the continuation of Dogecoin’s prolonged downtrend. On the flip side, a breakout above the upper trendline of the descending channel with volume confirmation could invalidate DOGE’s bearish structure and signal a potential trend change. Related Reading: Analyst Says Chainlink Price Could Crash 50% If This Level Fails Update On Dogecoin’s Current Price Action According to CoinMarketCap data at the time of writing, Dogecoin remains in negative territory, recording a price correction of more than 3% over the past 24 hours. Data indicates that the meme coin’s daily, weekly, and monthly price performances are in a pronounced slump. If this trend persists, Dogecoin could close January in the red, extending the downtrend that marked the end of 2025. Beyond weak price action, Dogecoin’s total market capitalization has also declined by more than 3%. Daily trading volume remains subdued, down over 2.5%, further highlighting waning investor confidence and reduced interest in the meme coin.

    "title": "Solana Scores Major Institutional Adoption As WisdomTree Goes On-Chain",
    "body": "Solana is rapidly positioning itself as a core hub for tokenized finance following WisdomTree’s deployment of fund infrastructure on the blockchain. The move reflects growing confidence among traditional asset managers in SOL’s ability to support large-scale, regulated financial products with the speed and cost efficiency required by modern capital markets. How Traditional Asset Managers Expand On-Chain Operations WisdomTree’s deployment of $159 billion in fund infrastructure on Solana marks a turning point for how regulated money moves. A research and news site, Genfinity, revealed on X that regulated money market funds are now settling natively on SOL, which means institutional cash flow assets no longer require traditional banking rails. One of the clearest signals is the Government money market digital fund, which already holds around $730 million in on-chain assets. Direct minting eliminates synthetic exposure with real Treasury-backed settlement. This allows retail investors to access institutional-grade financial products with blockchain speed and low costs. The multi-chain deployment is proof that financial institutions prioritize performance over narrative. Currently, SOL is processing the same regulated funds that previously required correspondent banks and a 3-day settlement. The gap between on-chain infrastructure and traditional finance products has just collapsed. An industry-leading commentary on the global capital markets, The Kobeissi Letter, reported that Coinbase has announced it is integrating with Jupiter Exchange directly into its on-chain trading stack. With this move, millions of Solana-based tokens can now be traded on Coinbase for the first time, all through Jupiter on-chain liquidity. Instead of relying on the slow manual process of listing assets on a centralized order book, Coinbase is currently using on-chain infrastructure to provide instant access to Solana-native markets. Under the new integration, users can deploy existing Coinbase balances and payment methods to trade tokens from a self-custodial wallet. “Even the centralized exchanges are moving on-chain,” The Kobeissi Letter noted. Why Liquidity Grabs Often Precede Reversals According to Larskooistra, the local context on Solana is fairly conducive to building a structure. The Price has already completed a Model 2 accumulation schematic, and grabbed all buy-side liquidity while taking the range high and broke market structure back to bearish, creating a supply in the process. Related Reading: Solana Structure Suggests One Final Test Before Bulls Can Step In From a higher-timeframe perspective, this gives a bearish context on BTC whenever accumulation models complete themselves and break the market structure, and then turn back to bearish afterwards, which shows a full reversal towards the lows. Larskooistra expects the equal lows acting as the next liquidity target to be taken out, and is looking for distribution schematics on the current move up.

Bitcoin failed to remain above $86,500 and started another decline. The price is trading above $85,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $83,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might dip further if it trades below the $81,000 and $80,000 levels. Bitcoin Price Dips Again Bitcoin price failed to continue higher above the $88,000 zone . BTC started a major decline below the $87,200 and $86,500 levels. The bears were able to push the price below $85,000. It spared major bearish moves, pushing the price below $82,000. A low was formed at $81,000 and the price is still signaling more downsides. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $83,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin is now trading below $83,200 and the 100 hourly simple moving average . If the price remains stable above $80,000, it could attempt a fresh increase. Immediate resistance is near the $82,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $83,200 level or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $90,438 swing high to the $81,000 low. A close above the $83,200 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $85,000 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $85,700 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $90,438 swing high to the $81,000 low. The next barrier for the bulls could be $87,000 and $87,500. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $83,200 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $81,000 level. The first major support is near the $80,500 level. The next support is now near the $80,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $77,000 support in the near term. The main support sits at $75,000, below which BTC might struggle to recover in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level.

    "title": "Bitcoin Is The Money Of The AI-Powered Economy: CryptoQuant CEO",
    "body": "CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju revived the “Bitcoin equals energy” thesis on Wednesday, arguing that proof-of-work is becoming the settlement layer for an AI-driven economy where power, not narratives, is the binding constraint. In a post on X, Ju framed Bitcoin as a digital instrument that can price energy with precision in a way commodities can’t. “Energy is money. Bitcoin precisely measures the value of energy,” Ju wrote. “Gold also embeds energy, but it cannot be measured accurately because it is not digital. Bitcoin is the money of an AI-accelerated energy economy.” The Link Between AI, Energy And Bitcoin Ju’s comments were posted alongside a long-form X post by Hashed CEO Simon Kim titled Monetizing Energy: Redefining Bitcoin’s Role in the AI Era, which argues that the old “energy waste” critique is being overtaken by an AI data center buildout that is rewriting the value of mining infrastructure. Kim’s core claim is that the debate has shifted from morality to grid economics and industrial pragmatism. “The oldest criticism of Bitcoin has always been about energy,” he wrote. “Claims that it ‘wastes electricity,’ ‘destroys the environment,’ and ‘competes with data centers for power’ have been repeated for over a decade, solidifying into conventional wisdom. But in 2026, this debate no longer resides in the realm of moral condemnation.” The thread points to capital flows as a tell. Kim highlighted Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala’s $437 million allocation to BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF in Q4 2024, followed by a partnership with Oman’s sovereign wealth fund to back Crusoe Energy and launch the Middle East’s first flare-gas mining operation. In October 2025, Mubadala co-led Crusoe’s Series E with a $1.375 billion check, pushing the company’s valuation above $10 billion—at which point Crusoe said it would divest its Bitcoin mining division and focus fully on AI infrastructure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Death Cross That Last Preceded A 66% Drop Is Back Kim’s thesis is that miners have already done the hard, unglamorous work AI now needs: securing power, mastering high-density thermal management, and building operational muscle around flexible load. He also leaned on an Elon Musk quote from a November 2025 podcast: “Energy is the true currency. This is why I say Bitcoin is based on energy. You can’t just pass a law and suddenly have a lot of energy.” A recurring theme in Kim’s post is that electricity’s constraints (locality, immediacy, and transmission losses) make flexibility economically valuable. He cited early examples like Sichuan hydropower curtailment exceeding 20 billion kWh by 2020, and argued that miners became a buyer of last resort for energy that couldn’t be stored or sold. Globally, he claimed curtailed renewable energy exceeds 200TWh annually, representing more than $20 billion in economic losses, positioning Bitcoin mining as an instant monetization path for surplus generation. In Texas, Kim pointed to ERCOT’s classification of mining as a controllable load resource, citing Riot Blockchain cutting power usage by 98–99% during the 2022 winter storm and receiving $31.7 million in power credits during an August 2023 heatwave, more than it would have earned mining that month. The framing is less “miners versus data centers” and more “premium uptime workloads versus interruptible demand that stabilizes the grid.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Won’t Break Out Until The Fed Steps Into Yen/JGB Chaos: Arthur Hayes Kim also argued the environmental critique is changing on the margin as the industry’s energy mix shifts. He claimed more than half of mining now comes from sustainable sources, exceeding 52%, while coal dependence fell from 36% to under 9%. On methane, he described flare-gas mining as an emissions arbitrage: methane has “80 times” the greenhouse effect of CO2, flaring combusts 93% with 7% escaping, while using gas for mining combusts over 99%, cutting CO2-equivalent emissions by over 60% versus flaring. The forward implication of Ju’s framing is that if AI accelerates the premium on reliable power and buildout speed, Bitcoin’s value proposition may increasingly be argued in the language of energy markets: measuring, monetizing, and transporting scarcity. Kim’s closing challenge was explicit: shift the question from consumption totals to system outcomes, suggesting the next phase of the debate will center on where miners sit in the stack of AI-era infrastructure, not whether they exist: “AI operates where continuous uptime is essential; Bitcoin operates where flexibility has value. Governments can print money, but they cannot print energy. Bitcoin’s proof-of-work is the mechanism that brings this physical reality into the digital economy. It’s a technology that takes energy from one place and transports it anywhere.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $86,779. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Ethereum (ETH) has retested its crucial $2,800 support level for the second time this week, as the broader crypto market erases all its intraweek gains. Some market observers have weighed in on whether investors should worry about King of Altcoin’s performance. Related Reading: Analysts Say Dogecoin Consolidation Is About To End – Parabolic Run Or Crash Ahead? Ethereum Plunges Amid Broader Market Crash On Thursday, global markets experienced a sharp decline, with stocks, cryptocurrencies, and even precious metals erasing over $3 trillion in market value in just a few hours. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, followed the market-wide correction, retracing 6.9% in the daily timeframe. The cryptocurrency has been hovering between $2,800 and $3,300 since the start of the year and attempted to reclaim the upper zone of this range this month. Nonetheless, the recent geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty have weakened the appetite for risk assets and halted the crypto market’s early January momentum. According to Binance market data, Ethereum fell below $2,800 on Thursday morning, briefly bouncing before reaching a one-month low of $2,773. Meanwhile, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin (BTC), saw a sharp 6.2% decline, reaching a two-month low of $83,934. Data from CoinGlass shows that crypto liquidations over the past 24 hours surged to nearly $1 billion, with $917.17 million in leveraged positions forcibly closed at the time of writing. During this period, 223,915 traders were liquidated, and the largest single liquidation order happened on Hyperliquid, valued at $31.64 million. Notably, more than half of the liquidations occurred in the past four hours, wiping out over $620 million since the morning. Around $422 million came from Bitcoin positions, while $160 million came from Ethereum positions. ETH Price In ‘Endless Range’ Amid the market correction, some analysts shared their perspective on ETH’s price action. Sjuul from AltCryptoGems highlighted Ethereum’s price range in the daily chart, where the altcoin has hovered over the past two months. According to the analyst, there isn’t a clear trend as Ethereum continues to trade within its “seemingly endless range” between $2,600 and $3,350. He suggested that investors should wait for a proper breakout above the upper boundary or a breakdown from the range lows before celebrating or worrying. Similarly, trader EliZ affirmed that ETH’s macro perspective doesn’t show either real strength or weakness, but “an enormous, forced equilibrium” on the longer timeframes. He pointed out that ETH “continues to move within well-defined boxes, above and below the same levels for months/years, without ever building a directionality that can be described as structural.” Related Reading: Prediction Markets On BNB Chain Explode As Trading Volume Crosses $20B Based on this, the trader asserted that without a successful move and confirmation from its key range, short-term efforts don’t signal a “change of regime. Only liquidity rotation.” “We are not in a bullish phase, nor are we in a bearish phase. We are in a macro stalemate, where the market decides not to decide. Until we see a clean and sustained breakout of the indicated boxes …or a net loss of the same …any strong narrative is just storytelling,” he concluded. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,798, a 5.3% decline on the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Risk-Adjusted Returns Signal Consolidation Rather Than Trend Formation – Details",
    "body": "XRP has slipped below the $1.90 level as selling pressure continues to weigh on the market, reinforcing a cautious tone across recent price action. Attempts at short-term stabilization have so far lacked follow-through, and momentum remains fragile as traders respond to weakening structure rather than clear directional signals. The move below $1.90 places XRP back into a zone where downside risk is being reassessed, particularly in the absence of strong demand on rebounds. Related Reading: Ethereum Leverage Remains At Record High: What Happens Next? A recent report from CryptoQuant provides context for this behavior, pointing to a market stuck in what it describes as a state of cautious equilibrium. According to Binance data, XRP is currently trading around $1.89, while the 200-day moving average sits near $2.54. This leaves price roughly 25% below its long-term trend reference, a gap that clearly signals ongoing structural weakness rather than a confirmed recovery. Historically, sustained bullish phases tend to develop only after price reclaims and holds above the 200-day average. XRP’s continued distance from that level suggests the market is still operating within a corrective range, where rallies are more likely to be sold than extended. While short-term recovery attempts are visible, they remain limited in scope and conviction. Risk-Adjusted Metrics Point to Consolidation The report explains that XRP’s current price action is best understood through a risk-adjusted lens rather than raw price movement. From this perspective, the 30-day Sharpe Ratio sits at just 0.034, a level close to zero. This indicates that over the past month, returns have provided minimal compensation for the risk assumed, a hallmark of markets lacking clear directional conviction. These conditions typically signal a consolidation phase, where volatility compresses, and traders become more selective, making price increasingly sensitive to shifts in liquidity rather than momentum. At the same time, the Sharpe Z-Score has turned positive at approximately 0.70, suggesting a relative improvement in return quality compared with XRP’s recent historical average. However, this reading remains well below the threshold generally associated with statistically significant trend formation. In practical terms, this implies that while selling pressure has eased from prior extremes, the market has not yet transitioned into a regime of strong risk-adjusted performance. Short-term dynamics reinforce this cautious view. The 7-day Sharpe Momentum stands near 0.03, reflecting weak but positive momentum. Although this keeps the indicator marginally above zero, the low magnitude points to gradual base-building rather than impulsive buying. Taken together, these metrics describe a market in balance—no longer under aggressive pressure, but still lacking the conviction and return profile typically seen at the start of sustained uptrends.

On the daily chart, XRP is trading near $1.87–$1.90, failing to hold recent rebound attempts and remaining firmly below all major moving averages. The 50-day moving average (blue) is trending downward and acting as dynamic resistance, while the 100-day (green) and 200-day (red) averages remain well above price, reinforcing the broader bearish structure. With XRP trading roughly 25% below the 200-day MA, the long-term trend has not yet reset into a bullish regime. Related Reading: XRP Derivatives Reset: Open Interest Drops Nearly 60% From July Peak Structurally, the chart shows a clear sequence of lower highs and lower lows since the October breakdown, confirming sustained selling pressure. The sharp vertical drop in early October marked a decisive trend shift, after which the price has consolidated in a descending range rather than forming a reversal base. Recent attempts to reclaim the $2.10–$2.20 failed quickly. Suggesting weak follow-through from buyers. Selling spikes during downside moves remains more pronounced than buying volume during rebounds, pointing to defensive positioning rather than accumulation. As long as XRP holds below the 50-day and fails to reclaim the $2.20–$2.30 zone, price behavior is more consistent with distribution and consolidation, not trend recovery.

    "title": "XRP To $100? Ex-Ripple CTO David Schwartz Weighs In On The Hype",
    "body": "Ex-Ripple CTO David “JoelKatz” Schwartz pushed back on viral XRP price calls, arguing that today’s market price is already a referendum on how much credible capital actually believes in a near-term path to $100. His comments also spilled into a broader discussion about XRPL economics and scaling tradeoffs that, in his view, get lost in the hype cycle. Can XRP Reach $100? Schwartz was responding to an X user urging him to tell “xrp supporters” that XRP “can’t and won’t go to 50-100$,” warning that “So many people get poor with investing in xrp.” Schwartz declined to make an absolute claim, but framed the debate in probabilistic terms, pointing to his own history of being surprised by crypto’s upside. Related Reading: 21Shares Drops 3 XRP Price Predictions For 2026: What’s The Upside? “I don’t feel comfortable saying something like that,” Schwartz wrote. “While I don’t think it’s likely, I didn’t think it was likely that XRP would ever hit $0.25. I started selling XRP at $0.10 because it seemed insane. I remember when bitcoin hitting $100 seemed like an impossible dream.” Rather than debating narratives, Schwartz offered a market-math thought experiment: if rational investors truly believed there was a meaningful chance of XRP reaching $100 within a few years, the current price would not sit far below double digits for long. “If many rational people believed that there was a 10% chance that XRP hit $100 within a few years, they definitely wouldn’t sell very much today at much less than $10,” he said. “Those with that belief would quickly buy up most of the XRP, because they’d value it more highly than those without that belief, and soon the supply of XRP well below $10 would dry up.” Schwartz then drew his conclusion from the gap between the hypothetical and the tape. “That the current trading price is well below $10 shows that there aren’t very many people who really think it has a 10% chance of hitting $100 within a few years with enough confidence to put their money where their mouth is,” he wrote, adding: “So anyone who says otherwise is not telling the truth.” He emphasized that readers can “do that same math” with different odds, time frames, and target prices. In a final note, Schwartz argued his baseline assumption is that crypto markets are “rational most of the time,” with major bull runs typically catalyzed by “unpredictable external changes,” rather than widely telegraphed certainties. Related Reading: XRP Risk-Adjusted Returns Signal Consolidation Rather Than Trend Formation – Details In a separate reply, Schwartz revisited an older famous X post by himself where he said that XRP “can’t be cheap.” Asked what he meant by this, he answered: “It means that a low price for XRP actually makes it more expensive to use for payments and exchanges.” The implication is mechanical: if XRP’s price is lower, more units are required to represent the same value in flight, potentially impacting how the asset is used across payment and exchange flows. Scaling The XRP Ledger Schwartz also addressed concerns about XRPL throughput after a user questioned whether “1500 per second (theoretical) is sufficient,” asking about ways to increase on-chain transactions per second. Schwartz said higher TPS is possible, but warned that most approaches shift costs onto node operators. “There are ways, but I don’t think you really want to,” he wrote. “Almost any way you do it imposes costs on everyone who runs a node. They have to receive more transactions, process and store more transactions, and relay more transactions to others.” He argued that decentralization pressure shows up when node costs rise without a matching benefit, and suggested a different optimization target: “This is why I think it makes more sense to try to increase the value of each transaction rather than trying to increase the number of transactions you can support.” With XRPL fees “so low,” he added, many transactions are “very low in value,” leaving room to “get more useful transactions on XRPL, even crowding out the worthless ones,” before throughput becomes the binding constraint. At press time, XRP traded at $1.76. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Bitcoin slid sharply this week, hitting just above $82,000 in early US trading and triggering a wide purge of crowded positions. Based on data from Coinglass, roughly 270,000 accounts were wiped out across exchanges in the past day, and close to $1.70 billion in total liquidations was recorded. Many of the losses came from traders who had bet that prices would keep rising. Related Reading: Gold, Silver Steal The Spotlight As Crypto Hype Fades On Social Media: Santiment Liquidations And Market Shock The move was fast. Long bets were the hardest hit. Reports say over 90% of the liquidated contracts were long positions, mostly in Bitcoin and Ether. The market was shaken quickly as stop orders were pulled and margin calls were forced. Price gaps showed up on some platforms and volatility spiked. This kind of clearing event can leave prices unstable for a bit, even after traders calm down. Geopolitics And Policy Pressure Reports note heightened tensions in the Middle East added fuel to the selloff. A US warship deployment and renewed public statements from US President Donald Trump put risk assets on edge. At the same time, an executive action linked to tariffs on goods tied to certain oil deals raised fresh concern among global traders. Risk appetite cooled as investors mulled how those moves might affect energy flows and trade. Tech Earnings And Investor Mood Microsoft’s earnings miss was another note in the mix. Some big tech names fell hard after results that showed rising costs and slower growth in cloud services. That made investors question the near-term outlook for AI-driven growth stories. With confidence wobbling in both stocks and crypto, many reduced exposure. The market atmosphere turned cautious and buying dried up in minutes. Bitcoin price action, risk aversion and volatility amid conflict headlines were both feeding into the selling. News feeds were full of sharp alerts. Traders who follow headlines closely found themselves adjusting positions quickly. Support Test And Wider Market Drops Bitcoin is trading near a higher-timeframe support area that mattered in recent months. Weekly closes have been caged between roughly $94,000 and $84,000 for several weeks, and that structure faces another test now. If buyers do not step in, deeper weakness could follow. Reports say the wider crypto market lost around $200 billion in value across tokens during the worst of the move. What Traders Are Saying Some analysts called the reaction overblown and noted that prices had already been falling since October. Others warned that a longer correction could be in play if macro pressures persist.

    "title": "Solana Could Reach $1,600+ Within Five Years, Bitwise CIO Says",
    "body": "Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, said he thinks Solana could plausibly become a trillion-dollar asset within five years—an outcome that would roughly translate into a ~$1,600 SOL price on a simple market-cap-per-token basis, depending on circulating supply. Hougan made the remarks on the Jan. 29 episode of When Shift Happens, framing his Solana view through what he called a “two ways to win” setup: growth in the addressable market (stablecoins and tokenized assets), plus an increasing share captured by Solana versus competing networks. Why Solana Could Hit $1,600+ Within 5 Years Hougan argued that the “infrastructure market” for stablecoins and tokenization is expanding quickly enough that large, liquid L1s should be valued less like niche crypto experiments and more like enabling rails for traditional finance. “The US Secretary of Treasury expects the stablecoin market to 12x over the next four years,” he said, adding that Larry Fink has described a future where “every asset, every fund, ETF, stock, bond, real estate will be tokenized.” From there, his Solana thesis leaned heavily on relative positioning. Ethereum remains the incumbent in stablecoins and tokenization, Hougan said, but Solana is “a legit competitor with an interesting technological differentiation,” and crucially “it’s extraordinarily easy to use and the community has a ship first attitude.” Related Reading: Solana Scores Major Institutional Adoption As WisdomTree Goes On-Chain That usability point, in his view, is underpriced by investors who focus on benchmark-style comparisons. “I think ease of use is a killer app that’s underrated by investors,” Hougan said. “Investors like to talk about throughput and they like to talk… TPS… who cares about this? …For an end user who’s trading, who’s on-ramping, ease of use is the killer app. And Solana is just easy to use, just dead easy to use.” Hougan also acknowledged a common investor blind spot: token supply dynamics can separate price action from market cap growth. He noted that Solana’s market value can rise meaningfully even if the token price revisits prior highs, and suggested staking yield partially offsets dilution, citing “roughly like 7% a year.” Another thread in the discussion was how regulation shaped institutional behavior. Hougan said Solana’s footprint in stablecoins and tokenization was constrained during the prior US regulatory environment, arguing that institutions “couldn’t build on Solana” if they believed it sat “outside of the regulatory perimeter.” With that cloud lifting, he said, mandates are starting to broaden. He also described why the ETF wrapper matters more for a smaller asset. “You put a little bit of inflows into an ETF package and they’re chasing a relatively small supply of Solana,” Hougan said. “It’s one of the best setups for an asset that I’ve ever seen because you have this small constrained size, you have significant institutional demand, you have stablecoins and tokenization… you put all that together and it seems like a winner.” Still, he avoided hard price targets and instead stayed in market-cap terms. “In 5 years I think it could be a trillion dollar asset. I think that’s relatively easy to imagine,” he said. “It’s hard to give a precise target because it depends on the pace of growth on stablecoins and tokenization. It depends on whether Congress passes the Clarity Act. It depends on the sort of crypto market cycles.” E156: @Matt_Hougan from @BitwiseInvest – $6.5M Bitcoin and the strongest Solana setup ever? This might be the most bullish yet rational episode we’ve done on the future of crypto: why debasement, institutional flows & tokenization are just getting started. Timestamps: 0:00… pic.twitter.com/WMqvKL7pCj — MR SHIFT 🦁 (@KevinWSHPod) January 29, 2026 On simple market-cap math, a $1 trillion Solana valuation implies a four-figure token price depending on supply. The relationship is straightforward: token price equals market cap divided by supply. Using Solana’s circulating supply of roughly 566 million SOL, a $1 trillion market cap works out to about $1,766 per SOL ($1,000,000,000,000 ÷ 566,000,000). Related Reading: Solana Pauses After 20% Drop — This Key Level Could Decide What’s Next If you instead use a fully diluted-style denominator closer to 619 million SOL, the same $1 trillion market cap implies roughly $1,615 per SOL ($1,000,000,000,000 ÷ 619,000,000). In other words, Hougan’s “trillion-dollar asset” framing maps to something like the mid-$1,000s per token on today’s supply assumptions, with the exact number moving as supply changes. Notably, Hougan’s Solana call sat alongside a broader macro narrative he returned to repeatedly: monetary debasement pushing investors toward scarce and non-sovereign stores of value. On Bitcoin, he argued the “two ways to win” are the store-of-value market expanding and Bitcoin taking share from gold, an arc he said could drive multi-million-dollar BTC over decades if the last 10–15 years of adoption trends persist. For Solana, the equivalent is less about being “digital gold” and more about becoming a primary venue for stablecoin flows and tokenized securities. If those rails scale and if Solana continues gaining share as a high-velocity, institution-friendly network, Hougan’s trillion-dollar scenario implies the market is still pricing the opportunity too conservatively. At press time, SOL traded at $115.40. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Crypto Expert Says The Bitcoin Cycle Is Already Over, Here’s Why",
    "body": "Questions are already surfacing over whether Bitcoin is still in the expansion phase that many market participants assume it is. However, a crypto expert opted for a conservative stance, arguing that when Bitcoin is analyzed through traditional cycle theory and macroeconomic indicators, the primary cycle may already be complete. This crypto expert, Tony Severino, challenged popular bullish claims from “snake oil salesmen” and instead pointed to economic data and historical patterns that show the Bitcoin cycle has already transitioned into a different phase. PMI And ISM Datan Shows Where Bitcoin Is According to Tony Severino, Bitcoin’s bullish cycle is already over, and analysts saying otherwise are pushing a fairy tale that may or may not come true. Severino’s outlook is based on the U.S. ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index, which he views as a reliable macro gauge for cyclical behavior. Related Reading: Global Liquidity Says Bitcoin Is Extremely Undervalued – Here’s The ‘Real’ Figure The PMI data shown in the chart below highlights a clear pattern of lower highs and lower lows, which is a signal of a weakening manufacturing environment. According to Severino, real cycles are measured from trough to trough, not from speculative projections of future upside. From that perspective, the current PMI structure means that the cycle has already peaked and is now rolling over. At the time of writing, this index is sitting around 47.9. Severino warned that a sustained move below the 46 level would change the PMI from a local pullback into a more pronounced intermediate downtrend. A drop beneath 41.6 would carry even more serious implications, as that level would fall below the COVID-era low. Such a move would leave only extreme historical comparisons, including conditions last seen during the 2007-2009 Great Financial Crisis or the stagflation period of the 1970s and early 1980s. Therefore, this macro backdrop directly challenges the idea that Bitcoin is on the verge of a guaranteed new bullish phase. Severino also took direct aim at popular Bitcoin valuation models that compare BTC to gold or rely on long-term projections detached from economic reality. The current reality is that Bitcoin is lagging behind gold and silver, which are attracting consistent inflows in contrast to Bitcoin’s show of fatigue around $80,000. Bullish Conviction To Bearish Targets Severino’s current stance is notable because it is a significant difference from his outlook before the current cycle began, when he was very bullish on Bitcoin. His recent analysis, shown in the chart below, shows Bitcoin breaking below a moving average on the monthly candlestick timeframe. This is notable because similar breakdowns in previous years were followed by drawdowns averaging around 50%. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals How Far Bitcoin Price Will Crash If The Uptrend Doesn’t Continue The chart highlights multiple instances where Bitcoin suffered declines of 40% to over 60% after losing this type of technical support. Based on that historical behavior, Severino has floated a downside target of at least $45,000 before another bullish reversal. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Suppression? Analyst Claims Single Force Keeping Price Under $90K",
    "body": "Bitcoin drifted under $83,000 on Thursday as market focus shifted toward how liquidity is stacked on exchanges. Reports say a mix of big orders and tight ranges has left traders feeling boxed in. Some analysts warn that a break under a key level could spark sharper selling, while others point to concentrated buy orders that might cushion a drop. Related Reading: Gold, Silver Steal The Spotlight As Crypto Hype Fades On Social Media: Santiment Order-Book Pressure And Liquidity According to trading-room data, one group or a cluster of large accounts appears to be shaping short-term moves by placing big bids and offers in the order book. This can keep price stuck in a narrow band. Material Indicators’ research flagged a pattern where bids are clustering around $85,000 to $87,500 — a zone that could act like a floor for now. The idea is simple: by piling up liquidity at certain prices, large players can get fills on their orders or discourage quick recoveries before options expiry. Market participants say this kind of behavior can trap less-experienced traders who react to sudden moves. At times, the pressure seems deliberate; at other times, it may be a byproduct of many traders aiming for the same levels. Either way, the result has been choppy price action and rising tension in the book. FireCharts shows $BTC price is being suppressed by one entity using a liquidity herding strategy to push price lower, potentially to get their own bids filled, or possible to keep price pinned in the lower end of this range before Friday’s options expiry. A significant amount of… pic.twitter.com/c63miAxBkh — Material Indicators (@MI_Algos) January 29, 2026 Whales, Wyckoff And The Spring Idea Reports note that a group of traders using Wyckoff-style thinking expects a “spring” — a drop below recent lows that then leads to a strong bounce as heavy hands buy at lower prices. Pseudonymous analysts have pointed to $86,000 as a strong buy wall provided by large orders. One commentator shared charts showing how a quick dip under $80,000 could serve as the spring before a rebound. Some traders view this pattern as part of accumulation. Others see it as a risky setup that could widen losses if support fails. The truth may sit between those views: both accumulation and the risk of a flush are possible in a tense market. Bitcoin Price Action Bitcoin has been moving in a tight range after failing to hold above $90,000. Price slid near $82,300 as fresh worries about monetary policy and world events hit risk assets. Volatility has been low at times and then spikes quickly, which makes trading tricky. Buyers have stepped in at certain levels, but they have not yet forced a clear break higher. Geopolitics And Fed Moves Reports say rising tensions in parts of the Middle East and talk about a new Federal Reserve chair pick have added to uncertainty. Some investors fear tighter policy would drain liquidity from markets and weigh on crypto. Market chatter has even mentioned US President Donald Trump in relation to political shifts that could influence economic policy. Safe-haven flows into other assets have been seen when headlines worsen, and those moves have pulled money away from riskier holdings.

A daily close below $86,000 would be read by many as a negative sign and could open the door to deeper selling. On the flip side, sustained buying at those levels could set up a rally if big liquidity holders decide to lift offers. For most people, patience and clear stop rules matter right now, because the market is being pushed by both order-book tactics and outside news, and either factor can shift price fast.
