    "title": "XRP Coils At Support: Refusal To Drop Hints At Potential Reversal — Here’s Why",
    "body": "The XRP price action is now showing signs of resilience as it coils tightly around a key support level, fighting against further downside pressure. Despite recent pressure across the broader crypto landscape, XRP has repeatedly held this level. With bearish momentum fading and volatility compressing, it could be preparing for a potential reversal. Support Cluster Shows Strength As XRP Holds Its Ground XRP is reaching a point where it refuses to go any lower. Crypto analyst Henry has noted on X that the token is whispering loudly right now, showing strength exactly where it matters, and rising clearly from its trendline support after days of bleeding. Related Reading: XRP Shows Unusual Market Behavior as Traders Weigh Fresh Bullish Signals for December This level has been tested, rejected, and respected with precision, but this bounce feels different as the structure looks cleaner, the moment feels calmer, and the overall price action seems controlled. Whether it breaks out this time or not, the setup is undeniably shifting fast. Adding to the momentum narrative, Bloomberg reports that $11 trillion asset manager Vanguard will begin to allow clients to access their XRP ETFs starting from tomorrow. Meanwhile, the US spot crypto ETF flows on December 1st came in at a solid $90+ million. As a result of the setup, Henry has suggested that the next major target sits around $2.20 region if the market confirms the move. An inverted look at the XRP chart over the last six weeks reveals a textbook 3-drive pattern, a formation that has constantly preceded major reversal events in crypto. According to Dom, the translation into a higher low has finally formed, which hints at the first sign that a trend change could be developing. However, bulls need to regain the monthly RVWAP around the $2.22 region, and holding above this area would mark a significant shift in structure, opening the door for a continuation rally towards the $2.50 range. The order books are clear enough that, if momentum is going to flip, this is the time. If this price setup fails to hold this structure and slips back below $2.00, Don warns that the end of the year could turn less favorable. Why Exchange Balance Is The Ultimate Supply Metric The Co-founder of Tedlabsio, trader and investor Niels, pointed out that XRP has just flashed one of the strongest bullish signals seen in the current market cycle. Over the past two months, roughly 45% of the XRP supply held on exchanges has been withdrawn and moved off trading platforms. Related Reading: What The Rapid XRP Outlfows From Crypto Exchanges Mean For The Price A drop in exchange supply this sharp only happens when the smart money is accumulating heavily. When the supply available on the exchange reduces, the selling pressure reduces, and this is how big moves begin. Niels believes that XRP is entering that phase where most people haven’t noticed yet.

    "title": "Best Altcoins to Buy as 2026 Altcoin Season Looms",
    "body": "What to Know: With improving macro and declining $BTC dominance, altcoins with clear narratives, liquidity, and real ecosystems look best placed for 2026 rotations. Altcoins stand to boom if the risk-on rotation comes to fruition in early 2026. Bitcoin Hyper brings SVM‑powered smart contracts and low‑latency execution to Bitcoin, targeting real DeFi and payments usage on BTC collateral. Maxi Doge channels 1000x trader culture into a meme token with future competitions, dynamic staking, and a treasury backing future partnerships. Is liquidity about to flip? Bitcoin dominance has started to leak lower , even as spot ETF flows stabilize and macro data quietly improves. With global PMI readings ticking back into expansion and traders increasingly pricing an eventual end to quantitative tightening, we’re seeing the first ingredients for a proper ‘risk‑on’ rotation in 2026. If that shift accelerates, capital typically moves in stages: Stage 1: Bitcoin – The cycle begins here. Capital flows into the market leader first as the safest entry point during a shift. Stage 2: Large Caps – Money rotates from $BTC into established, high-valuation cryptocurrencies (typically assets like Ethereum or Solana). Stage 3: High-Conviction Altcoins – Capital moves to mid-cap assets, but strictly those meeting specific quality criteria: Actual user bases. Clear, understandable narratives. Sufficient liquidity to support significant investment. Stage 4: Low-Float / Story-Driven Names – This is the speculative phase where prices go ‘vertical.’ However, there are some critical conditions for longevity here: Requirement: Must be backed by real infrastructure and legitimate community culture. Warning: Projects relying solely on ‘memes and promises’ without substance generally struggle to maintain their value. Then, to top it off, crypto analysts like Shanaka Perera on X say the altcoin resurrection is coming , and watching key information will be the biggest indicator as to when. That’s why the most interesting plays now are assets sitting at the intersection of structural demand and narrative readiness: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , and Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) all do exactly that, making them the best altcoins to buy . 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): First Bitcoin Layer 2 With SVM Firepower Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) positions itself as the first-ever Bitcoin Layer 2 with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, essentially grafting Solana‑style performance onto Bitcoin’s settlement layer. Instead of trying to redo Bitcoin, it uses a modular design: Bitcoin L1 for finality and a real‑time SVM L2 for high‑throughput execution anchored back to mainnet. On the technical side, $HYPER runs a low‑latency execution environment using the SVM, enabling sub‑second confirmation times and high TPS for smart contracts. A decentralized Canonical Bridge lets you move $BTC into wrapped representations on L2, where fees drop to cents, and complex transactions become economically viable. That unlocks a full DeFi and dApp stack denominated in $BTC: high‑speed payments, AMM swaps, lending markets, staking protocols, NFTs, and even gaming. It’s all built with familiar Rust tooling and SPL‑style tokens modified for this L2. For a full project breakdown, check out our ‘ What is Bitcoin Hyper ’ guide. For developers, it’s essentially Solana‑grade UX with Bitcoin security and demand as the underlying collateral base. Crucially, the market is already responding. The Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale has raised over $28.9M with tokens priced at $0.013375, signaling deep early liquidity and conviction at the infrastructure layer. With dynamic staking rewards currently at 40% you can make your money work for you without any extra effort. Smart money is also moving. Whale buys have hit highs of $500K , showing big money is getting in early. Join the $HYPER presale today. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Meme Liquidity for 1000x Trader Culture Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is the pure sentiment play on speculative energy. Branded as a 240‑lb canine juggernaut embodying the 1000x leverage trading mentality, $MAXI wraps degen culture into a meme token built around competition, leaderboards, and shared upside through its community treasury. Instead of being ‘just a dog coin,’ Maxi Doge leans into a ‘Leverage King’ identity. Future holder‑only trading competitions, on‑chain leaderboards, and reward pools are designed to keep activity around the token, giving it a narrative hook during risk‑on rotations when gamblers return in force. The presale numbers already show meaningful traction: over $4.2M raised with tokens priced at $0.0002715, giving you clear exposure to a meme that actually has structural community mechanics. A dynamic staking APY currently at 72% adds another layer, encouraging you to lock tokens. In a 2026 altcoin season scenario where meme risk comes roaring back, tokens with defined culture, visible scoreboards, and funded treasuries tend to outperform anonymous copy‑paste projects. Maxi Doge is aiming squarely at that lane with its treasury‑backed ‘Maxi Fund’ for liquidity and partnerships. Learn how to buy Maxi Doge today. 3. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): NFT IP Turning Into Tokenized Infra Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) is a very different kind of altcoin candidate: a utility token sitting under one of the strongest NFT‑origin brands in crypto. $PENGU powers the Pudgy Penguins Web3 ecosystem, supporting gaming, staking, governance, and broader participation across a fast‑expanding IP universe that already spills into mainstream retail. The token runs on Solana with a max supply of 88.88B, tapping into low fees and high throughput while benefiting from major exchange liquidity and established infra. It’s closely tied to Pudgy’s push into gaming and digital experiences, where NFTs, merch, and token incentives can all reinforce each other in a flywheel. As the ecosystem grows through partnerships and IP expansion, including integrations with zk‑powered infrastructure like the Abstract network, $PENGU becomes a way to capture value from that brand growth rather than just speculate on individual NFTs. This aligns it with a broader shift toward ‘media‑fi,’ tokens under recognizable, memetic IP. July price action shows what happens when culture and capital collide: $PENGU rallied more than 60% after Coinbase adopted a Pudgy Penguin NFT as its profile picture, a small but visible vote of confidence from a major platform. If altcoin season becomes a bet on recognizable consumer brands, Pudgy Penguins could be near the front of the pack. Buy $PENGU from top exchanges like Binance. Recap: If 2026 delivers a real altcoin season on the back of easing macro and falling Bitcoin dominance, infrastructure‑grade bets like Bitcoin Hyper, cultural memes like Maxi Doge , and established IP tokens like Pudgy Penguins offer three distinct ways to position. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

    "title": "XRP Breakout Sparks $2.40 Target as Maxi Doge Presale Heats Up",
    "body": "What to Know: XRP’s clean break through resistance has traders watching the $2.33–$2.40 zone while $2.204 support shapes the near-term risk picture. The move is pushing risk-on energy into meme and trading-community tokens as traders chase higher-beta plays. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) channels 1000x leverage culture into ERC-20 mechanics, mixing staking, contests, and community alpha to help retail stretch gains. Meme coins are shifting from passive jokes to game-style trading hubs where performance matters as much as the memes. XRP finally punched through a key resistance channel. Many traders had written it off as dead money, but the breakout woke everyone up again. With bulls now watching the $2.33-$2.40 zone, the mood has flipped from survival to ‘how can I squeeze more out of this move?’ At the same time, support around $2.204 is doing the heavy lifting. As long as that level holds, aggressive traders can lean into upside setups without taking full downside risk. If the level cracks, you can expect a full mood reset across the majors, not just XRP. Think of $2.204 as the floorboard you hope doesn’t start creaking. While XRP fans argue about Fibonacci lines and volume gaps, a different crowd is playing the higher-beta game. Capital is rotating into new crypto projects like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – a loud, gym-bro meme that worships 1000x leverage energy. Instead of quiet charts and patient TA, this camp wants weekly competitions, community alpha, and big bragging rights. For these traders, the idea is simple. If XRP grinds its way toward $2.40, meme and community tokens are where many will try to outperform. That is where projects like Maxi Doge step in. They try to act less like passive bets and more like social trading arenas built around conviction, risk, and leaderboard pressure. The kind of place where your PnL gets judged like a squat PR. XRP’s Breakout Fuels Risk-On Meme And Trading Narratives When a large-cap token breaks resistance, it usually flips the mood across the whole market. XRP did exactly that. Traders who have aged a few emotional years waiting for this breakout are now considering how to amplify returns if $2.33–$2.40 comes into play, while $2.204 continues to act as a safety net. Meme and trading-community tokens have become the natural extension of that mindset. You see it with tokens tied to trading culture and exchange mascots. They act like liquid side bets on market aggression. Some rely on pure memes. Others offer minimal utility, such as copy-trading, fee perks, or community tools. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) joins that pack. However, instead of being a passive mascot, it attempts to serve as a symbol of high-risk, high-conviction trading. It’s one of several tokens trying to turn degen culture, leaderboards and shared alpha into a full on-chain playground for people chasing more than slow XRP-style gains. Maxi Doge Turns Leverage Culture Into A Tokenized Arena Most meme tokens stop at funny branding, but Maxi Doge pushes far beyond that. It builds its entire identity around a 240 lb canine powerhouse that copies the mindset of traders who dream in 1000x leverage. The attitude is loud, playful, and clear: never skip leg day, never skip a pump. You can tell right away what kind of energy this token is trying to project. The core idea behind $MAXI is simple. It takes this ‘Leverage King Culture’ and turns it into real on-chain features that people can use. Instead of relying on random hype, the project tries to create a full trading arena where holders get access to private competitions and weekly leaderboards that show who managed to pull the highest ROI. The Maxi Fund treasury sits atop this system, supporting the project with liquidity and partnership deals, so the whole setup feels more like an ongoing challenge than a meme that hopes for a lucky pump. Rewards inside the ecosystem depend on performance, not surprise giveaways. That shifts trading from a one-time gamble into a recurring game. All of it runs on a clean ERC-20 framework on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, with the smart contract handling supply, distribution, and staking in the background. The loud culture is on the outside, but the mechanics underneath stay simple and stable. The presale has already raised $4.2M, and right now you can buy $MAXI for just $0.0002715. Retail traders can join through dynamic APY staking, powered by a 5 percent allocation pool that pays out for up to one year. Join the $MAXI presale today.

    "title": "Coinbase Plugs Crypto Into US Mega Banks: Is $PEPENODE the Next 1000x Crypto?",
    "body": "What to Know: Coinbase connecting stablecoin and custody rails to major US banks could accelerate institutional flows into crypto while normalizing tokenized dollars in tradfi. As infrastructure institutionalizes, speculative capital historically migrates down the risk curve into higher-volatility narratives like memecoins and gamified yield experiments. PEPENODE’s mine-to-earn model gamifies virtual mining, removing hardware complexity while front-loading incentives for early participants via tiered node rewards. Mine-to-earn and virtual mining designs highlight a broader shift from passive staking dashboards toward interactive, game-like front ends for on-chain yield and speculation. Coinbase quietly flipping the switch on stablecoin and custody pilots with America’s biggest banks is more than another partnership headline. It’s the first real attempt to plug crypto rails directly into the core of US tradfi, turning token transfers into something that feels like moving dollars inside online banking. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong spoke at the NYC DealBook Summit on December 3 about Coinbase piloting programs with banks to integrate stablecoins . That matters for you because the bottleneck in every cycle has never been interest; it’s infrastructure. When wires, ACH, and card networks are the only ramps, fresh capital drips in. If large US banks can custody crypto and move stablecoins across their internal systems, the next wave of liquidity can hit exchanges and on-chain markets much faster. But institutional plumbing doesn’t automatically answer where the risk-on capital actually goes. Bitcoin and majors tend to absorb the first inflows, then liquidity leaks down the curve into narratives that can move 10x, 100x, or more in a single cycle. In 2021, it was DeFi and dog tokens . This time, memecoins are colliding with gamified mechanics and mining nostalgia. That’s the setup where PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is starting to trend: the world’s first mine-to-earn meme coin trying to capture degen attention as Coinbase connects the pipes. Instead of buying another dog on a DEX, you enter virtual mining, promising hardware-free, gamified yield, turning mining into a game. Why Institutional Rails Push Degens Further Out On The Risk Curve Coinbase’s work with major US banks around stablecoin rails and custody isn’t just compliance theater. It points to a future where treasurers, asset managers, and even corporates can move tokenized dollars with near-instant settlement and transparent on-chain records, then hold $BTC, $ETH, and other majors under bank-grade custody. As those flows normalize, the ‘serious’ capital anchors itself in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe a handful of blue chips. Retail and degen capital, by contrast, historically chases volatility at the edge, chasing memecoins, experimental DeFi, and new token primitives that can actually outperform when majors grind sideways. That’s where mine-to-earn and game-infused token models like $PEPENODE come in. Already down to mine? Check out our ‘ How to Buy PEPENODE ’ guide. Several projects are already trying to fuse mining aesthetics with user-friendly yield: browser mining clones, cloud-mining NFTs, and clicker-style games that sit on top of standard staking contracts. But most still feel either like reskinned staking dashboards or opaque mining contracts. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) stands out, positioning its mine-to-earn concept as a more transparent, gamified alternative built directly on Ethereum. How PEPENODE Turns Mining Into A Virtual Meme Economy Where traditional mining demands ASICs, power bills, and technical know-how, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) leans into a Virtual Mining System running on Ethereum smart contracts. You buy and customize ‘Miner Nodes,’ upgrade in-game facilities to boost output, and earn meme coin rewards such as $PEPE or $FARTCOIN, all without ever plugging in a single watt of physical hardware. Its core pitch is that early adopters get access to more powerful nodes with higher reward multipliers, solving two persistent problems in mining-inspired projects: weak early incentives and opaque reward math. Tiered node rewards and a gamified dashboard will make the experience feel closer to a crypto-native idle game than a spreadsheet of APRs. Post-TGE gameplay activation is planned to kick in once the token is live. But if you get in now, you can get staking rewards of 573% On the capital-raising side, the $PEPENODE presale has already attracted traction, with over $2.2M raised at a token price of $0.0011778. Whale tracker data reveals significant purchases with the largest hitting $94.1K , hinting that some higher-conviction wallets are positioning early around the mine-to-earn thesis. Because $PEPENODE is structured as an ERC‑20 on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake chain, staking, rewards distribution, and any future governance all route through smart contracts rather than off-chain servers. That means the ‘mining’ loop is effectively a UX layer over on-chain logic – a bet that the next 1000x crypto narrative won’t just be about culture, but about turning yield itself into a game you can actually play. See how far we think it can go in our $PEPENODE price prediction. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

    "title": "Best Crypto Presale to Buy Now: Bitcoin Hyper Supercharges Bitcoin with Layer 2 Scalability",
    "body": "What to Know: Bitcoin’s Layer 1 is highly secure but limited by slow throughput, high fees, and no native smart contracts, restricting payments, DeFi, and everyday on-chain activity. Demand is rising for a system that pairs Bitcoin-level trust with Solana-grade speed, creating a clear market gap for scalable, programmable Bitcoin Layer-2 solutions like Bitcoin Hyper. Bitcoin Hyper launches a high-performance Bitcoin Layer 2 with SVM integration, enabling faster-than-Solana execution for wrapped BTC across payments, DeFi, NFTs, and more. With ultra-low-latency processing and SVM smart contracts, Bitcoin Hyper aims to transform idle $BTC into a productive asset powering dApps, gaming, and high-speed on-chain ecosystems. Bitcoin has spent the last cycle proving one thing: it’s one of the world’s premier reserve assets. But while $BTC dominates in security and brand, it still feels stuck in 2017 when you try to actually use it. Slow confirmations, inconsistent fees, and no native smart contracts make everyday utility an uphill battle. That gap has powered entire ecosystems. Solana , Ethereum, and their L2s captured users who wanted speed, low fees, and programmable money. Bitcoin holders, meanwhile, have mostly been sidelined into ‘hold and hope’ strategies, watching billions in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming flourish elsewhere. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is built around a simple premise: Bitcoin shouldn’t have to choose between being sound money and usable money. It aims to turn slow, expensive $BTC into a high-throughput Layer 2 where you can move Bitcoin in seconds for tiny fees while tapping DeFi, dApps, and NFTs directly tied back to Bitcoin’s security. Instead of trying to reinvent Bitcoin, Bitcoin Hyper plugs a Solana Virtual Machine-based execution layer into Bitcoin’s settlement layer, targeting Solana-level performance for $BTC itself. If you’ve been looking at the next wave of Bitcoin infrastructure plays, Bitcoin Hyper’s presale positions itself squarely as a bet on bringing full-stack utility to the world’s largest crypto. Bitcoin Hyper Turns Idle $BTC Into a High-Speed DeFi Asset Bitcoin Hyper takes Bitcoin from a passive store of value to an active asset that you can actually put to work. You can bridge $BTC in, wrap it, and then send payments that confirm in seconds, with fees designed to stay tiny even during peak demand. For users, it feels more like Web2 payments than classic Bitcoin. Under the hood, SVM integration means developers can deploy fast, Solana-style smart contracts while still anchoring value back to Bitcoin. That unlocks $BTC-native swaps, lending, staking, NFTs, and gaming dApps without forcing you to abandon the Bitcoin economic base. Bitcoin Hyper explicitly targets Solana-level throughput for a smoother UX. For builders, Bitcoin Hyper adds SDKs and Rust-based tooling, so you can spin up DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, or games that speak the same language as Solana but settle value in Bitcoin. The presale has already raised $28.9M with tokens priced at $0.013375, signaling early conviction that $BTC’s utility layer is overdue. Read more about how to buy $HYPER during the presale. Can Bitcoin Hyper’s Presale Fuel a Breakout? The upside thesis for $HYPER rests on one idea, fundamental to what Bitcoin Hyper actually is: Bitcoin holders finally getting a credible, high-throughput Layer 2 to match the chain’s brand and liquidity. Momentum indicators are starting to line up behind that narrative. Whale investors haven’t been idle, steadily making major $HYPER purchases: $500K whale buy $396K whale buy $274K whale buy If you believe $BTC will anchor the next cycle, but utility will live on L2s, Bitcoin Hyper sits directly in that flow. High-speed payments, low fees, and DeFi for wrapped $BTC all feed into the same story: turning dormant Bitcoin into productive capital. Our price prediction echoes that idea, with $HYPER potentially reaching $0.08625 by the end of 2026, representing some 545% gains. Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as the bridge between Bitcoin’s brand and modern crypto UX. Fast, low-cost $BTC transfers and SVM-powered dApps all stack into a straightforward pitch: give Bitcoin the app layer it never had, without compromising its core value proposition, and make $HYPER one of the best crypto presales . If you’re looking at narrative-driven infrastructure plays for the next cycle, $HYPER offers a pure bet on Bitcoin scalability, programmability, and DeFi catch‑up. Buy $HYPER in presale.

    "title": "75% Chance Crypto Is ‘Crossing The Chasm’ Now, Says Moonrock Capital Boss",
    "body": "Moonrock Capital founder Simon Dedic says the crypto industry is nearing a decisive transition from an early-adopter niche to a mainstream market, assigning a 75% probability that the sector will “finish crossing the chasm and enter the early-majority phase next year.” Is The Crypto Market Crossing The Chasm? Dedic frames his outlook using the classic technology adoption curve, which splits the market into innovators (2.5%), early adopters (13.5%), an early majority (34%), late majority (34%) and laggards (16%). The critical “chasm” lies between early adopters—“people who want newest things” and accept a minimum feature set—and the early majority, who demand a “whole product solution” and prioritize complete, convenient offerings. In his base case, Dedic argues that crypto is now close to exiting that chasm. If so, he says, “the classic 4-year cycles are dead. The market will have matured and will increasingly correlate with macro cycles and industry fundamentals rather than self-fulfilling narratives.” Under this scenario, pricing would be governed less by reflexive narratives around halvings or “altseason” and more by the sector’s real economic role and its interaction with broader financial conditions. Related Reading: This Is The ‘Strangest’ Crypto Sell-Off Ever, Claims Arca CIO He assigns a 20% probability to a less advanced stage of adoption in which the industry is “still in the early-adopter phase and only now beginning to cross the chasm.” In that case, he believes crypto could face “a 1-3 year bear market while the industry finds itself and pushes toward early-majority adoption.” Here, the established four-year pattern could remain intact, with another prolonged downturn before mainstream product-market fit is fully achieved. The remaining 5% is reserved for a failure scenario in which the sector never secures such fit. “We get stuck in the chasm and never find true mainstream pmf,” Dedic writes, warning that crypto could then “turn into a zero sum game and we will just PvP trade money from one to the other.” Related Reading: Risk Runs Hot: Massive Crypto Liquidation Wave Slams Traders Overnight Dedic makes clear he views that outcome as unlikely. He cites “regulatory tailwinds, institutional adoption, and the accelerating fundamentals of our industry” as reasons to believe the market is already in scenario one, “standing right in front of the biggest adoption wave crypto has ever seen, and likely ever will see.” He also argues that market structure and culture must evolve alongside adoption. “The 4 year cycles and simple narrative chasing are dead,” he says. While “the onchain online casino will always be part of our identity, it will shrink into a niche. It’s time for the industry to mature and start playing the serious game.” For Dedic, that conviction is not theoretical. “An incredible decade lies ahead for those willing to evolve,” he concludes, adding that he is “betting basically all my money on the idea that this is only just getting started.” At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.15 trillion.

    "title": "BlackRock Warns on US Debt While Bitcoin Hyper Presale Accelerates",
    "body": "What to Know: Rising U.S. debt and heavy Treasury issuance are killing the charm of long-duration bonds, so institutions are looking toward Bitcoin and other digital assets as hedges. As Bitcoin adoption grows, demand is shifting away from simple price bets toward real infrastructure for fast payments, DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) introduces a Bitcoin-anchored Layer 2 that uses the Solana Virtual Machine to fix Bitcoin’s slow transactions, high fees, and lack of smart contracts. Competition among Bitcoin Layer 2 networks will heat up as macro pressures and institutional inflows reward projects that mix Bitcoin’s trust with real performance. Surging US debt and sticky deficits are no longer a quiet background issue. They are starting to feel like the entire plot. BlackRock’s recent AI-driven research makes it clear: nonstop Treasury issuance and rising interest costs put pressure on long-term bonds. When the concept of a risk-free asset starts wobbling, investors begin asking the classic question: where do we turn next? Bitcoin keeps showing up in those conversations. After the spot ETF wave, $BTC turned into a boardroom-friendly hedge. If US debt continues to climb, a supply-capped and rules-based asset starts looking pretty good. That is the broad idea BlackRock is pointing toward. But once institutions agree Bitcoin belongs in the hedge bucket, the next question hits fast: how do you actually use $BTC inside today’s high-speed markets? On-chain Bitcoin is slow, block space is tight, and fees can spike into tens of dollars when the network gets busy. Great for cold storage. Not great for anything that needs to move quickly. This is the gap Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to front-run. It markets itself as a high-performance Bitcoin Layer 2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , offering sub-second settlement and smart contracts while anchoring its security to Bitcoin. If BlackRock’s macro outlook drives more capital into $BTC, Bitcoin Hyper aims to be the platform where that capital actually generates results. Think payments, DeFi, gaming, NFTs, and more. Why Debt Risks And Institutional Flows Favor High-Throughput Bitcoin Infrastructure If the U.S. is heading toward chronic deficits, higher rates, and nonstop Treasury issuance, then long-duration bonds stop looking like a safe parking spot and start acting like a stress test. That is why large asset managers talk about needing new hedges. Bitcoin fits that role, as do gold and tokenized assets backed by real collateral. As institutions add Bitcoin exposure, the pressure builds to make $BTC usable, not just something you lock in a vault. Lightning facilitates payments, but it does not support complex smart contracts or high-performance DeFi applications. Ethereum rollups and Solana solve those problems, but they are not secured by Bitcoin, which matters to investors who want their hedge and their infrastructure to be based on the same monetary foundation. That is why the race among Bitcoin-aligned Layer 2s and sidechains is speeding up. Stacks, Rootstock, and others are trying to push programmability closer to Bitcoin, each making different trade-offs. Bitcoin Hyper is one of the new crypto projects taking a more ambitious approach: instead of building a new system, it uses the Solana VM and anchors it to Bitcoin. It is like taking a sports car engine and dropping it into a truck known for reliability. Inside Bitcoin Hyper’s SVM Layer 2 And The Ongoing Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) focuses heavily on speed. The design is modular: Bitcoin Layer 1 handles settlement and data availability, while an SVM-powered Layer 2 handles execution. Developers can use Rust and Solana-style tools, but the chain ultimately settles back to $BTC instead of $SOL. The goal is simple: push beyond Solana speeds while inheriting Bitcoin’s trust and brand power. Bitcoin Hyper currently relies on a single trusted sequencer. It batches transactions and anchors its state to the Bitcoin blockchain. This setup allows extremely low-latency confirmations, which works well for order-book DEXs, gaming loops, and NFT mints. Fees aim to stay at fractions of a cent, not the usual on-chain $BTC spikes. A decentralized canonical bridge moves $BTC into wrapped assets for fast swaps, payments, lending, and staking.

    "title": "The MicroStrategy Of Asia: Japanese Company Announces Plan For Bitcoin And XRP Treasury",
    "body": "Bitcoin and XRP have become central to a bold corporate shift in Japan, with AltPlus announcing that both digital assets will be formally incorporated into its long-term treasury strategy. The publicly listed company disclosed the move in its recent shareholder filing, outlining a multi-layered plan that positions cryptocurrencies as foundational components of its future financial and operational framework. Bitcoin And XRP Lead Treasury According to a post by “BankXRP” on X (formerly Twitter), AltPlus is expected to purchase and hold Bitcoin and XRP through a newly established cryptocurrency purchase and management division. The company frames this step as part of a long-horizon capital strategy supported by blockchain transparency, expanding global regulatory clarity, and the growing institutional acceptance of digital assets. In the filing, Bitcoin and XRP are highlighted for their scarcity, decentralization, predictability, and fast, low-cost transactional capabilities—attributes AltPlus expects will contribute to long-term value growth and broader financial-market utility. Related Reading: XRP Price Is Performing As Expected; Analyst Reveals What Comes Next Moreover, the treasury initiative is designed to strengthen the company’s financial base, diversify revenue streams, and establish a stable earnings engine through staking-based income. AltPlus presents the move as a structured method to enhance capital efficiency and reinforce corporate value over time. The company notes that holding both Bitcoin and XRP aligns its balance-sheet strategy with emerging global trends in digital-asset management and institutional-grade treasury practices. AltPlus also outlines its risk-management system to address crypto-market volatility, liquidity risks, cybersecurity threats, regulatory changes, and speculative trading patterns. The company plans to implement investment-scale limits, a controlled holding-ratio strategy, and a proprietary internal asset-management system to govern acquisition, custody, tracking, and treasury integration. These measures are designed to maintain governance discipline, ensure compliance, and safeguard digital-asset operations as part of the broader corporate structure. AltPlus’ Web3 And Digital-Asset Expansion Beyond treasury allocation, AltPlus frames Bitcoin and XRP as key elements in a broader transition into digital-asset operations and Web3-enabled business development. The filing situates this shift within a global context, noting that major financial institutions and listed companies worldwide are increasingly incorporating crypto assets into holding, settlement, and capital-management functions. Related Reading: Are Dogecoin Whales Leaving The Meme Coin? Large Transactions Crash To 2-Month Lows Building on this trend, AltPlus plans to integrate blockchain infrastructure into its Entertainment and Solutions business. This includes exploring Web3 functionality, token-based engagement models, and digital-asset utilities across its gaming and IP ecosystem. These initiatives are intended to unlock new business models, enhance operational flexibility, and develop internal expertise for a digital-native market environment. The company’s decision to include XRP directly in its treasury strategy is one of the standout elements of the announcement. AltPlus positions XRP as a long-term corporate asset alongside Bitcoin, marking a notable step forward for institutional crypto adoption in Japan. Through treasury transformation, staking-driven income generation, and Web3 ecosystem expansion, AltPlus is creating a strategic framework similar to the high-conviction treasury approach seen at MicroStrategy. At the same time, it is establishing a distinctly Japanese model focused on utility, diversification, and forward-looking corporate innovation.

    "title": "XRP Price Predictions: AI Forecasts $4.40 By March 2026, Analysts Target Up To $6",
    "body": "Recent bullish predictions for the XRP price have emerged, hinting at a potential for new all-time highs (ATHs) by March 2026 for one of the market’s leading altcoins. XRP Price Projected To Reach New ATH By Q1 2026 According to projections from ChatGPT, XRP could reach approximately $4.40 by the first quarter of 2026, a notable increase of 120% from current levels around $2. In contrast to the AI forecast, some analysts believe that the XRP price has the potential for a stronger rally. They suggest that structural changes could allow XRP to exceed $5 and potentially approach $6 by 2026. Several factors support their optimistic view. For instance, key aspects of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) case against Ripple were resolved earlier this year, which they believe could encourage banks and payment providers to adopt XRP for cross-border transactions, fostering greater confidence in its utility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims $93,000: Could Altcoins Rebound Amid Predictions Of An Upcoming Bear Market? Additionally, Ripple’s ecosystem is expanding well beyond XRP. In December 2024, the company launched a dollar-pegged stablecoin known as RLUSD, which has already achieved a market cap exceeding $1 billion. While RLUSD itself may not directly boost XRP’s price, it has the potential to attract more participants to Ripple’s network, thereby creating secondary demand for XRP as a bridging asset. Analysts posit that a steady pipeline of RLUSD adoption could enhance Ripple’s revenue growth, consequently driving the XRP price higher. $2.60 Key For Momentum Shift Moreover, analysts point to the upcoming Bitcoin (BTC) Halving, expected in 2028, as a potential catalyst for a broad crypto market rally. The analysts assert that the XRP price has historically benefited from such cycles. From a technical standpoint, chart analysts see XRP setting up for a potential breakout. Price action has formed a base around the low $2 range, which could lay the groundwork for further recovery. Related Reading: Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade Goes Live Today: Experts Predict Potential Supply Crunch Ahead According to the analysts, if bullish momentum can push the token above significant resistance levels around $2.60, it could change momentum indicators to a positive stance. Moreover, a sustained rally into the mid-$3 territory might then pave the way for XRP to reach the $4 to $5 range. When writing, the XRP price stands at $2.14, recording a 1.6% drop in the past 24 hours. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Analyst Compares Buying XRP Now To Buying NVIDIA Shares In 2000 At $0.35",
    "body": "A crypto market analyst has compared XRP to NVIDIA, an American technology company with one of the biggest tech success stories in history. The analyst implied that buying XRP today could mirror the opportunity investors had when purchasing NVIDIA shares in 2000 at just $0.35. The comparison emphasizes the long-term potential of the XRP price and highlights the importance of HODLing. XRP Today Shows Growth Potential Like NVIDIA In 2000 A leading market expert, Egrag Crypto, has drawn a striking parallel between the current XRP price and the early days of NVIDIA. He suggested that buying XRP now could be akin to purchasing NVIDIA shares at just $0.35, as recorded in 2000. At the time of writing, the shares are priced around $180, representing a staggering 51,329% increase from over two decades ago. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: XRP Price Has Formed A Bullish Cross On Its Weekly Stochastic RSI Egrag Crypto points out that a $10,000 investment in NVIDIA at $0.35 per share in 2000 would have secured roughly 28,571 shares. At today’s prices, those shares would be worth over $5,142,780, demonstrating an investment strategy focused more on maintaining conviction and patience than timing or predicting the market perfectly. Beyond this, the analyst’s comparison illustrates the power of investing long-term in disruptive technologies, showing how early adoption and willingness to hold through volatility can result in life-changing gains. Applying this perspective to XRP, Egrag Crypto highlighted that the cryptocurrency has surged from $0.006 to $3.65 over the past 10 years. By comparing the altcoin to NVIDIA shares, he suggests the cryptocurrency could have similar potential for transformative, explosive growth. As a result, he implied that the current XRP price of $2.2 may present a potential entry point for investors willing to commit to a disciplined long-term strategy. Much like NVIDIA in its early days around 2000, XRP is still in the initial stages of its growth trajectory. The cryptocurrency recently emerged from a prolonged legal battle with the US SEC that had constrained its development and price appreciation for nearly 7 years. With increasing utility and ongoing ecosystem developments, XRP is well-positioned to grow over time. While its price has declined roughly 20% this year, according to CoinMarketCap, analysts remain optimistic about its long-term outlook. XRP On-Chain Activity Hits Record Levels On the technical front, XRP has experienced a remarkable surge in on-chain activity, signaling heightened engagement across the network. Data from CryptoQuant shows that on December 2, the velocity metric for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) spiked to a yearly high of $0.0324. Related Reading: Warning: XRP Price Is Forming A Death Cross That Previously Led To A 15% Crash Analysts from CryptoQuant have revealed that the rise in circulation velocity suggests that XRP is being actively traded rather than sitting idle in cold wallets. The increase points to high liquidity and significant participation from whales who appear to be moving large amounts of tokens. Additionally, such activity indicates that the XRP network is experiencing unprecedented levels of engagement, with more coins changing hands in a short time than the market has seen so far in 2025.

Related Reading: Eric Trump Says Bitcoin Could Hit $500,000, Stands By ABTC Strategy After several days of elevated activity, shifting ETF flows, and a rare alignment of technical indicators, the memecoin is now sitting at a point where sentiment and structure appear to be converging. The conversation around Dogecoin is beginning to shift from short-term speculation to whether the asset is preparing for a larger breakout as the year closes. Recent trading sessions have highlighted a steady rise in activity, driven initially by an 8% price jump that pushed DOGE to the $0.15 region. The move came alongside a 242% surge in volume, reflecting strong participation from retail investors. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview DOGE ETF Momentum Builds as Market Structure Tightens A major catalyst behind recent volatility has been the rollout of multiple DOGE-related exchange-traded products. Grayscale’s GDOG and Bitwise’s BWOW have recorded early but steady inflows, now totaling nearly $2.9 million since launch. Although the numbers remain modest, analysts view these products as important steps toward bringing Dogecoin into mainstream financial products. At the same time, technical structure on the charts has narrowed into a symmetrical triangle, a pattern that forms when lower highs and higher lows converge. Current support sits in the $0.145–$0.150 range, with the upper boundary near $0.165. A breakout above this ceiling could open the door to targets between $0.18 and $0.20. Indicators such as RSI, MACD, and the TD Sequential tool show early signs of shifting momentum, though signals remain mixed and require confirmation through stronger volume. Retail Traders Lead as Analysts Reassess Despite rising optimism, institutional traders have taken a more cautious stance. Futures open interest and derivatives volume have cooled, pointing to a market waiting for a clearer direction. Still, retail participation has continued to rise, and analysts note that Dogecoin’s ascending channel remains intact as long as price holds above the $0.1470 level. Across higher timeframes, DOGE has also reclaimed a series of higher lows, reinforcing the possibility that the meme token is attempting to build a more sustainable bullish structure. Some analysts project a potential move toward $0.42 over the coming months if current patterns persist, while more aggressive models leave room for a retest of psychological levels in the $1 range, though such targets remain highly speculative.

    "body": "XRP has reclaimed the $2.10 level after a strong rebound across the broader crypto market, signaling renewed confidence following several days of fear, volatility, and sharp pullbacks. Analysts now see the potential for a sustained recovery as momentum returns and buyers show signs of stepping back in. The reclaim of this key level comes at a crucial moment, with traders closely watching whether XRP can build enough strength to challenge higher resistances in the coming sessions. Related Reading: Bitmine Buys Another 18,345 Ethereum ($54.94M) In Fresh Accumulation Push – Details Adding to the renewed optimism, a new report from CryptoOnchain on CryptoQuant highlights a major spike in XRP Ledger Velocity, marking one of the strongest on-chain signals of 2025. On December 2, the Velocity metric surged to 0.0324, its highest value of the year. Velocity measures how frequently XRP moves across the network, serving as a direct indicator of economic activity, liquidity, and transactional demand. Such a dramatic rise in Velocity shows that XRP is circulating rapidly among users rather than sitting dormant in wallets. It reflects increased participation from traders, active holders, and possibly even whales, pointing toward heightened engagement on the network. Network Activity Surges as Velocity Signals Peak 2025 Engagement According to the CryptoOnchain report, the latest spike in XRP Ledger Velocity indicates a dramatic shift in how XRP is being used across the network. Instead of sitting idle in cold wallets or being held for long-term storage, XRP is rapidly changing hands among market participants. This level of circulation suggests that traders, active users, and possibly whales are driving significantly higher transaction volume than usual. CryptoOnchain explains that such a strong jump in Velocity typically signals high liquidity and deep participation across the ecosystem. When coins move this quickly, it means the asset is being used in real economic activity—whether for trading, transfers, arbitrage, or strategic repositioning by large holders. This type of behavior often aligns with periods of heightened volatility, increased speculation, or structural shifts in market sentiment. Regardless of whether price trends upward or downward, the data confirms that the XRP Ledger is entering one of its most active phases of 2025. User engagement has reached a yearly peak, with more participants interacting with the network and more coins circulating than at any point this year. Such elevated activity often precedes or accompanies major market movements, reinforcing the idea that XRP is transitioning into a more dynamic and liquid phase as the recovery unfolds.

After the sharp sell-off in late October and November—which pushed XRP below the $2.00 level for the first time in months—the asset is now trying to stabilize. The recent bounce reflects short-term buying interest, yet the price still trades below all major moving averages, signaling that bulls have not fully regained control. The 50-day SMA is currently sloping downward near $2.35, acting as immediate resistance. The 100-day SMA around $2.55 and the 200-day SMA near $2.60 form a stacked barrier above price, confirming a structurally bearish setup. For XRP to build meaningful upside momentum, it must reclaim at least the 50-day SMA and flip it into support—something it has failed to do since late September. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidation Dominance Hits Multi-Year High: The Real Cause Behind BTC’s Breakdown Support remains stable around $2.00–$2.05, where buyers have defended the level repeatedly with long lower wicks.

    "body": "Dogecoin has spent the majority of the past 30 days drifting lower, falling into a tight and almost predictable rhythm of lower highs and lower lows. The movement has been sluggish, but technical analysis shows that something important may now be forming. A new analysis shared by crypto commentator Clifton Fx suggests that Dogecoin is approaching the end of this decline, and the chart he posted highlights a falling wedge pattern that could become the basis for a 96% rally if buyers finally step in with conviction. A Falling Wedge That Has Started Attracting Attention Technical analysis of Dogecoin’s price action on the 12-hour chart shows two downward-sloping trendlines gradually converging. This pattern is highlighted by coiling price action, with each bounce becoming smaller and the space between the trendlines becoming narrower. Related Reading: Here’s The Bullish Trend Developing To Trigger A 174% Move For The Dogecoin Price This structure is what analysts often describe as a falling wedge. It forms during a downtrend, but the more it tightens, the more it hints that sellers are losing control and buyers are quietly gaining ground. Clifton Fx pointed exactly to this development in his post, noting that Dogecoin is already pushing against the upper boundary of the wedge. The chart he shared shows the price making repeated attempts to break out, something that is typically viewed as early evidence that momentum is shifting. As it stands, recent price action in the past 48 hours or so has led to the creation of multiple green 12-hour candles after Dogecoin rebounded from a $0.135 low. This has caused the Dogecoin price to approach the upper resistance trendline, and the outlook depends on what happens here. In the analyst’s view, a strong breakout candle above the wedge would confirm that the pattern has completed and that Dogecoin is ready for a sustained move upward. The Case For A 96% Rally The appeal of this technical setup is the potential size of the move if the breakout plays out. The wedge spans a wide vertical range, and in technical analysis the height of the pattern is a guide for estimating the rally after a breakout. Related Reading: XRP Price To $10, Solana To $600, And Dogecoin At $0.75? Analyst Reveals When Based on the structure visible on the chart, a successful breakout would open the door for a 96% climb from current levels. However, this doesn’t guarantee that the move will happen immediately. Dogecoin has been under pressure for weeks, and a breakout without proper momentum can easily fail. A clean surge above the trendline, preferably one that arrives with rising trading volume, would help confirm that buyers are taking over. Anything slower or weaker could see the Dogecoin price rejecting at the resistance trendline and falling to approach the lower support trendline, which is now around the mid-$0.13 range.

    "body": "Ethereum (ETH) is topping talks once again as its Fusaka upgrade goes live and the ETH price returns firmly above the $3,200 mark. After weeks of choppy trading and lingering fear across the broader crypto market, the combination of a major technical overhaul and rising on-chain activity is giving traders a fresh narrative to follow. Related Reading: Eric Trump Says Bitcoin Could Hit $500,000, Stands By ABTC Strategy In the last 24 hours, ETH has climbed around 4–5%, outperforming most large-cap cryptos and reclaiming a key psychological zone near $3,200. Market data shows rising volumes and a noticeable pickup in accumulation from larger holders, even as sentiment indicators still sit in “Fear” territory. ETH's price trends to the downside, but records some gains on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Fusaka Upgrade Shifts Focus Back to Ethereum’s Scaling Roadmap The Fusaka upgrade, Ethereum’s second major network update of 2025, activated at block height 18,200,000. At its core is PeerDAS, a data availability sampling system that lets nodes store only slices of blob data instead of entire payloads. This change is estimated to expand blob throughput by roughly eight times, easing congestion and helping layer-2 networks push more transactions through Ethereum’s base layer. Developers describe Fusaka as another step in Ethereum’s long-term scaling roadmap, aligning the main chain with growing layer-2 activity. Beyond PeerDAS, the upgrade bundles a series of Ethereum Improvement Proposals that tweak gas limits, transaction sizes, cryptographic support, and block configuration, aiming to improve efficiency while keeping validator requirements manageable. Whales, ETFs and Technical Signals Cluster Around $3,500 On-chain data shows “shark” wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have ramped up accumulation in recent weeks, buying aggressively on dips around $2,700–$3,000. Institutional interest also appears to be rising. BitMine has reportedly added more than 18,000 ETH to its treasury ahead of Fusaka, while U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs have recorded notable net inflows. Technically, ETH is trading around $3,200 with analysts watching resistance between $3,300 and $3,500. Short-term models project a move toward roughly $3,537 within days, implying upside of about 10% if the current trend holds. However, indicators remain mixed. The broader setup is still labelled “bearish,” and any pullback could see ETH retesting support around $3,100, $3,000, or even the $2,850 zone.

    "title": "Ethereum NUPL Holds Steady, Signaling Market Balance Amid Volatility",
    "body": "Ethereum is demonstrating notable relative strength after reclaiming the $3,150 level and attempting to push higher, offering a refreshing shift in sentiment following weeks of intense selling pressure, fear, and market-wide uncertainty. As the broader crypto landscape begins to stabilize, ETH stands out as one of the assets showing early signs of recovery, drawing renewed attention from traders and long-term investors alike. Related Reading: Tron Hits $80.2B Stablecoin Milestone After Tether Mints 1B USDT On The Network A key factor supporting this shift is the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) reading for Ethereum on Binance, which is currently sitting around 0.22 while price trades near $3,100. This level reflects a delicate equilibrium between fear and optimism, indicating that a significant portion of ETH holders remain in moderate profit. Importantly, NUPL has not yet moved into the “greed” zone typically seen in the late stages of a bullish cycle, suggesting that the market is far from overheated. Instead, Ethereum appears to be transitioning into a more neutral, constructive phase where investors are cautiously optimistic but not excessively euphoric. This balance often forms the foundation for a healthier recovery, especially after a deep correction. If momentum continues building and NUPL remains stable or trends higher, ETH could be positioning itself for a stronger upside move in the coming weeks. NUPL Signals a Transitional Market Phase Arab Chain notes that Ethereum’s NUPL index experienced a significant rise between June and August, reaching levels far higher than today and reflecting strong profitability across the network during mid-2025. At that time, investor sentiment leaned toward optimism, supported by rising prices and improving macro conditions. However, as Ethereum’s price began to decline steadily from October onward, unrealized profits started to shrink. This pushed NUPL down toward more neutral territory, signaling a shift in sentiment from elevated optimism to a more grounded, cautious outlook. Crucially, NUPL has not fallen into negative territory, meaning the average ETH holder has not transitioned into unrealized losses. This is an important sign of underlying market strength. When investors remain in profit, they tend to be less motivated to sell aggressively at lower prices, reducing the risk of panic-driven capitulation and helping stabilize price action during corrections. Taken together, these signals indicate that Ethereum is currently in a transitional phase. The market is neither euphoric nor fearful—rather, it is waiting for a decisive catalyst to define the next trend. As long as NUPL stays above 0.20, Ethereum retains a meaningful level of investor confidence, increasing the likelihood of a rebound if liquidity strengthens or positive fundamental developments emerge. Related Reading: Bitmine Buys Another 18,345 Ethereum ($54.94M) In Fresh Accumulation Push – Details ETH Rebounds Strongly on the Weekly Chart Ethereum’s weekly chart shows a powerful rebound as price surges back above the $3,150–$3,200 region, reclaiming a critical support band that had turned into resistance during the November sell-off. The long lower wick from last week’s candle confirms strong buy-side interest around the $2,700–$2,800 zone, an area that has historically acted as a major demand region during multi-month corrections. ETH has now reclaimed the 100-week SMA, a key trend indicator currently positioned near $2,900, signaling renewed structural stability. The 200-week SMA, sitting comfortably lower, continues to reinforce the long-term uptrend. However, the 50-week SMA, which has flattened and now looms around the $3,350–$3,400 level, represents the next significant resistance level. ETH will need a decisive weekly close above this moving average to confirm a true shift back into bullish momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Cut In Half As $6.4B In Positions Vanish: Market Reset Accelerates Volume on the rebound is notably stronger than in previous consolidation phases, suggesting increased participation and growing confidence among market participants. However, ETH is not yet in the clear. The series of lower highs since the September peak forms a descending structure that must be broken for a sustained uptrend to resume.

    "body": "In the volatile theatre of the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are showing signs of a potential high-time-frame reversal. After weeks of stress and price compression, each of the top assets is now stabilizing at key structural support levels. The multiple leading cryptocurrencies are flashing similar recovery setups at the same time. The current crypto landscape may be setting up one of the most powerful high-time-frame reversals across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. An investor and trader known as MacroCRG on X highlighted that yesterday, all three assets printed a bullish engulfing candle, a strong signal that buyers are stepping back in with intent. Market Leaders Hint At A Shift Before Smaller Assets Follow On the weekly chart, each asset is showing the early stages of an inside-week breakout paired with a false breakdown. MacroCRG pointed out that a similar structure on the ES (S&P 500 futures) chart from April, where the breakdown of inside-week structure led to a breakout that never looked back when the bull secured the weekly close. Related Reading: Institutions Exit Bitcoin In Large Tranches, Ethereum, Solana And XRP See Massive Buy-Ins For this setup to take hold, these prices need to close the week above the key highlighted highs on the chart. However, there’s still a long way to go before the weekly close will confirm the breakout, and the bulls need to follow through with conviction and remove any doubt. The founder of the ProMintClub investment community, ProMint, has spotted a high-conviction whale trader aggressively building long positions across the crypto market. Currently, the trader is leading the Lighter leaderboard with over $64 million in profit and loss, while maintaining an 83% long bias. His Lighter account has the highest profit and loss with over $8 million. These are insane numbers compared to everyone else on the leaderboard. Data shows that the trader has made five deposits into his Lighter account, which total around $6 million in capital. His positions are spread across BTC, ETH, SOL, AAVE, along with smaller plays such as PAXG and PUMP, consistently entering at strong timing points and riding momentum higher. Even though funding costs have flipped heavily negative, he is not backing down. Presently, this is the top-performing account on Lighter, and this is serious capital deployed with conviction. How Increased Partners Drive Sustained Volume Demand According to Chainflip Labs, November marked one of the strongest performance months in the protocol’s history, clearing over $583 million in swap volume, which is the second-best month ever for the network.

    "title": "Bitcoin Signals Bear Market: One Thing Could Flip It, Says CryptoQuant CEO",
    "body": "Bitcoin may be sliding into a new bear phase unless fresh macro liquidity – particularly through spot ETFs – returns to the market, according to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju. Bitcoin Bear Market Incoming? Sharing a composite on-chain dashboard overlaid on the BTC price, Ju wrote on X: “Most Bitcoin on-chain indicators are bearish. Without macro liquidity, we enter a bear cycle.” The chart stacks ten CryptoQuant metrics behind the price in a red-to-green heatmap from 2021 to 2025, highlighting how regime shifts in prior cycles coincided with clusters of bearish readings. Related Reading: US Sen. Lummis Hints At US Bitcoin Buy With ‘Franklin’ Meme The indicators in the panel include the MVRV Z-score, CryptoQuant P&L Index, the Bull-Bear Cycle Indicator, Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse, Network Activity Index, Stablecoin Liquidity, Bitcoin Demand Growth, Trader On-chain Profit Margin, Trader Realized Price and a Technical Signal metric. When the majority are bullish, the backdrop turns light green; when they flip bearish, it shifts to red. In the latest section of the chart, as BTC has pulled back from its highs, red once again dominates – the visual basis for Ju’s warning. For the next major move, Ju argues that on-chain data is now subordinate to macro conditions and ETF flows. Quoting his own post, he wrote: “It is simple. If you think macro gets better next year, you buy. Otherwise, you sell. I’m not a macro expert, so find macro bros. New ETF inflows are the key.” That line pinpoints what he believes can “save” Bitcoin from a deeper drawdown: renewed demand from spot ETFs as a conduit for institutional capital. In earlier stages of the cycle, rising ETF inflows coincided with strong price appreciation; more recently, slowing or negative flows have mirrored the loss of upward momentum. Ju frames the current environment as one that demands flexible scenario management rather than rigid forecasts. “At this stage, it is more about being reactive than predictive. Set your scenarios and trade accordingly,” he told followers. The composite chart is designed for exactly that purpose, showing how past bull tops and bear markets aligned with persistent stretches of red across profit, valuation and liquidity metrics. Related Reading: Bitcoin And The 2026 Fed Shift: Expert Says Markets Aren’t Ready Despite the bearish tilt, Ju does not foresee a repeat of the 2022 collapse, when Bitcoin fell roughly 65% from peak to trough. He cites the behaviour of Michael Saylor led Strategy as a stabilizing factor. “If Strategy holds its 650K BTC this cycle (or sells only a little), we would not see another -65% drawdown like in 2022,” he wrote. In his view, that supply remaining largely off the market reduces the probability of a violent deleveraging event. Ju characterizes the current pullback as substantial but not extreme in historical context. “We are about -25% from ATH now, and even if a bear cycle comes, the downside would likely be smaller and look more like a broad sideways range,” he argued, suggesting that prolonged consolidation is more likely than a single dramatic crash. His message to long-term investors is explicitly calming. “Long-term holders should avoid panic selling,” he advised. While cyclical on-chain indicators flash red, he insists the structural backdrop has improved: “Bitcoin has more liquidity channels now, so the long-term outlook is obviously strong, imo.” Those channels include ETFs and a deeper institutional market structure than in prior cycles. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $92,494. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Ethereum Back At $3,200 As Sharks Show Strong Accumulation",
    "body": "Ethereum has witnessed a recovery surge recently as on-chain data shows the shark-sized investors have been participating in strong buying. Ethereum Sharks Have Added 450,000 ETH Since Mid-November According to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the supply of the Ethereum sharks has gone up recently. The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution,” measuring the total amount of tokens that a given wallet group as a whole is holding right now. Related Reading: Next Key XRP Level Could Be $1.2 If Current Support Fails, Says Analyst In the context of the current topic, the cohort of focus is the one corresponding to a coin range of 1,000 to 10,000 ETH. At the current exchange rate, the lower bound of the range roughly converts to $3.2 million and the upper one to $32 million. Investors of this large size are popularly known as the sharks. While not as massive as the whales (addresses with more than 10,000 ETH), the sharks are still considered influential entities. This can make their behavior often worth keeping an eye on. As the chart below, shared by Santiment, suggests, the latest Ethereum shark behavior has been one of accumulation. During the November price decline, the Supply Distribution had been going down for the Ethereum sharks, but around the time of the market bottom, its trend began to reverse. Between November 18th and December 2nd, the sharks added a total of 450,000 ETH (worth about $1.4 billion) to their wallets, a massive amount. Alongside this sharp uptick in the metric, ETH went through its price recovery. The cryptocurrency’s sharp retrace to start December didn’t dissuade these large hands, either, as their supply only continued to rise. This may be one of the factors behind the quick resumption of bullish momentum that the asset has seen. Another bullish factor has been the trend in the Network Growth, another on-chain indicator displayed in the chart. This metric measures the daily number of addresses that are coming online on the Ethereum network for the first time. A wallet is considered “online” when it participates in transaction activity on the blockchain, so the Network Growth essentially tracks the addresses making their very first transfer. From the graph, it’s visible that this Ethereum metric has also surged recently, hitting a peak value of 190,000 addresses. Generally, a surge in network activity is usually a positive sign for any rally’s sustainability, as it implies that the network is able to attract fresh attention. Related Reading: Bitcoin Blasts To $92,000, Liquidating $182 Million In Shorts That said, too much attention too fast can actually end up having a negative effect on the cryptocurrency. It now remains to be seen whether the sharks will continue to buy in the near future and if investor FOMO will remain at healthy levels. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $3,185, up more than 5% over the last seven days. Featured image from Dall-E, Santiment.net, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Reports have disclosed that the US Federal Reserve has ended its Quantitative Tightening program and has put cash back into markets. According to sources, the Fed injected more than $13 billion through overnight repo operations, the largest such move in years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trail Ends: $29M Seized After European Authorities Shut Down Cryptomixer Crypto investor and author Paul Barron said that coins like XRP could “bring the fire” now that more liquidity is flowing back into the system. He believes that when the Fed starts easing up, assets with clear utility often react faster than the rest of the market. Barron added that stronger liquidity usually pulls traders toward tokens that can move money quickly and cheaply, which is why he thinks XRP may see more attention if this trend continues. Markets reacted quickly. Bitcoin rose about 4% in a 24-hour span to reach $93,800. XRP climbed more than 8%, touching $2.18 as demand picked up. 🔥 THE FED JUST DOUSED THE FLAMES: $13.5B repo injection, 2nd-largest since C@#$D After months of burning through liquidity (QT), they’re flooding the system again. Here’s the pattern: When the Fed brings water, $BTC, $ETH, $XRP brings the FIRE. Risk assets don’t cool down when… — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) December 2, 2025 Liquidity Push Fuels Market Moves According to analysts, this type of liquidity shift often lifts risk assets, including crypto. Tom Lee of BitMine said on TV that Bitcoin gained nearly 20% in the weeks following the last time the Fed shifted away from QT. He noted that the same setup might lead to more upside before the year ends. Many traders are watching how much money returns to markets because it can shape short-term sentiment. ETF Flows And Long-Term Views According to reports, new XRP ETFs have already attracted more than $800 million in inflows. Supporters say these inflows can change how investors view XRP, although they don’t remove all uncertainty. Some hedge fund managers also weighed in, pointing out that over the past 16 years the Fed added close to $9 trillion in liquidity while only removing $3.2 trillion before reversing course. Utility Tokens May Get More Attention Some community voices argue that tokens built for payments or settlement may see stronger demand if liquidity continues to rise. One XRP supporter said XRP was made to move money at scale and claimed the market will focus more on assets with real use cases. Adoption remains mixed. Some companies that previously used Ripple’s tools have stepped back, while others still rely on parts of its payment network. The XRP Ledger is being used, but not always in the same way it was during earlier partnerships. Related Reading: Eric Trump Says Bitcoin Could Hit $500,000, Stands By ABTC Strategy Outlook For The Market With Bitcoin holding steady at the $93,000 level, and XRP at $2.22, the market is clearly reacting to the Fed’s change of direction. Liquidity helps drive rallies, but it also creates quick pullbacks and shaky moments. Barron’s line — that coins like XRP could “bring the fire” — hangs over the market: renewed liquidity may be the spark that helps XRP ignite fresh momentum. But fire can spread fast or fizzle out; traders should stay alert, manage risk, and not get burned if the rally cools as quickly as it heats up. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Ethereum Coils For A Breakout As IH&S + Heavy Accumulation Emerges",
    "body": "Ethereum is approaching a critical moment as multiple bullish signals begin to align. A clear Inverse Head & Shoulders formation, combined with rising accumulation and weakening trend rejection, suggests that the market may be gearing up for a powerful upside move. With momentum tightening and key levels coming into focus, ETH now stands on the verge of a breakout that could set the stage for its next major rally. Inverse Head And Shoulders Signals Brewing Momentum According to a recent update shared by crypto analyst Donald Dean, Ethereum may be gearing up for a significant move. He highlighted the development of a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern, a classic bullish reversal formation that often precedes strong upward momentum. This emerging structure suggests that ETH could soon shift into a more aggressive bullish phase if confirmed. Related Reading: Ethereum Rockets Higher, Narrowing Distance to a Make-or-Break Resistance Line Dean also pointed out that the weekly chart is showing solid support near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, positioned around $2,750. Adding to the bullish signals, a hammer candle has appeared on the weekly timeframe, hinting at buying pressure stepping back in after recent downside movement. If the pattern plays out, Dean noted that Ethereum’s first major target lies at $4,109, a level that would allow ETH to challenge previous resistance/support zones. Reclaiming this region would mark a meaningful shift in momentum and strengthen the bullish outlook for the asset. Beyond that, the next upside target sits near $5,766, which aligns closely with the 1.618 Golden Ratio extension calculated at approximately $5,793.51. Dean described this confluence as particularly noteworthy, suggesting that if Ethereum breaks above its nearer targets, a larger rally toward this golden-ratio level becomes a realistic possibility. Growing Accumulation Suggests Bulls Are Preparing For Action In an earlier analysis, LSTRADER reminded followers of the impressive move from $1,600 to $4,800, noting that this surge had been identified in advance through both the ETH chart and the ETH/BTC setup. The analysis captured the momentum shift that preceded the rally, reinforcing the value of tracking key structural signals. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Cut In Half As $6.4B In Positions Vanish: Market Reset Accelerates In the current market structure, LSTRADER noted that the chart clearly shows multiple instances where the trend faced rejection. Despite these rejections, the trend is steadily losing strength while accumulation continues to build, a combination that typically reflects growing bullish interest and the potential for an upward breakout. However, LSTRADER stressed that no major move should be assumed until the trendline itself is broken, and confirmation is still required. For now, patience is key as traders continue monitoring the structure and waiting for a decisive shift in trend direction. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "Ethereum price started a fresh increase above $3,20 0. ETH is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above $3,250. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,050 and $3,120 levels. The price is trading above $3,120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with support at $3,130 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above the $3,240 zone. Ethereum Price Eyes Another Upside Break Ethereum price managed to stay above $2,920 and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin . ETH price gained strength for a move above the $3,000 and $3,050 resistance levels. The bulls even pumped the price above $3,150. However, the bulls struggled to clear $3,240 and $3,250. A high was formed at $3,239 and the price recently corrected some gains. There was a spike below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent move from the $2,718 swing low to the $3,239 low. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with support at $3,130 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If there is another upward move, the price could face resistance near the $3,200 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,240 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,250 level. A clear move above the $3,250 resistance might send the price toward the $3,320 resistance. An upside break above the $3,320 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,450 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,240 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,120 level. The first major support sits near the $3,050 zone. A clear move below the $3,050 support might push the price toward the $3,000 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,980 region and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent move from the $2,718 swing low to the $3,239 low in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,850 and $2,840. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone. Major Support Level – $3,130 Major Resistance Level – $3,240",

    "body": "As institutional demand intensifies and the crypto market recovers, US spot XRP Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) continue to lead the sector with a 13-day streak and over $200 million in positive net flows this week, outshining Solana (SOL) ETFs, which recorded their third day of outflows in seven days. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Price In A ‘Vulnerable Technical Environment’ – Key Levels To Watch XRP Funds Lead Crypto ETF Inflows Spot XRP exchange-traded funds have extended their record-breaking streak after registering their thirteenth consecutive day of positive net flows, with $50.27 million in inflows on December 3. The investment products have seen a remarkable performance since the launch of Canary Capital’s XRPC, the first single-token XRP spot ETF, on November 13, positioning the funds as the fastest-growing altcoin-based category. Notably, XRPC surpassed all initial expectations and debuted on Nasdaq with a total volume of $58 million, recording around $357.54 million in positive net flows in 13 days. Last week, the second group of XRP funds went live, becoming the largest US ETF launches of 2025 with over $60 million in net inflows each during their first day. Moreover, the category, led by Grayscale’s GXRP and Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ, surpassed other major ETFs in single-day inflows, including those based on the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Solana, Bitcoin (BTC), and Ether (ETH). Amid this week’s market recovery, XRP ETFs saw $89.65 million on Monday, $67.7 million the following day, and an additional $50.27 million on Wednesday, for a cumulative net inflow of $207.66 million during the first three days of December. As a result, the leading category surpassed both Bitcoin ETFs’ $52.4 million and Ethereum ETFs’ $51.3 million positive net flows, respectively, during the same three-day period. With a total of $874.28 million in inflows in 13 days, spot XRP ETFs have surpassed the $618.62 million total inflows of SOL ETFs, which held the record among the second wave of altcoin-based investment products. Solana ETFs Demand Loses Steam While XRP ETFs take the spotlight, Solana funds’ momentum has slowed, seeing their largest days of outflows this week. According to SoSovalue data, the investment products recorded $32.9 million in outflows on December 3, marking their third negative net flows day since the category debuted on October 28. Despite pulling out positive net flows, Bitwise’s BSOL, Fidelity’s FSOL, and Grayscale’s GSOL were unable to absorb 21Shares’ TSOL $41.8 million in outflows. This performance also marks the fourth negative day for TSOL over the past week. As reported by NewsBTC, Solana ETFs experienced a record performance in November despite the market correction, with $613 million in inflows during their 22 consecutive day positive streak. Related Reading: Solana Eyes Major Resistance After $140 Reclaim, But Analyst Questions SOL’s Strength However, the remarkable streak ended a week ago when TSOL registered negative net flows for the first time, and the category was unable to absorb them, recording outflows of $8.1 million. SOL-based investment products started December with outflows worth $13.5 million, which were followed by strong inflows worth $45.77 million on Tuesday. On December 3, the funds registered $32.19 million in outflows, amounting to a negative net flow of $700,000 for the first half of the week, despite the altcoin’s recent price recovery.

    "title": "Bitcoin Market Structure Echoes 2022 Bear Start, Glassnode Warns",
    "body": "On-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out how the current Bitcoin market is reminiscent to the structure from the first quarter of 2022. Bitcoin Dynamics Are Currently Looking Similar To Early 2022 Bear Market In its latest weekly report, Glassnode has discussed about how the broader Bitcoin market structure is starting to resemble Q1 2022. First, the analytics firm has shared the data of its Supply Quantiles Cost Basis Model, highlighting price levels that correspond to a certain degree of investor profitability. In the chart, three supply quantiles are listed: 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95. If Bitcoin trades at the first of these levels, 75% of the supply will be in profit. Similarly, the latter two correspond to 85% and 95% profitability, respectively. Related Reading: Ethereum Back At $3,200 As Sharks Show Strong Accumulation It’s visible in the graph that Bitcoin has recently fallen below all three of these levels, indicating more than 25% of the cryptocurrency’s supply is now underwater. “This creates a fragile balance between the risk of top-buyer capitulation and the potential for seller exhaustion to form a bottom,” explained Glassnode. BTC similarly broke below the 0.75 quantile back during the sideways market of early 2022. Another indicator that reinforces the resemblance is the Total Supply in Loss, which measures, as its name suggests, the amount of the Bitcoin circulating supply that’s being held at some net unrealized loss. Below is a chart showing the 7-day moving average (MA) trend in the metric. As displayed in the graph, the 7-day MA Bitcoin Total Supply in Loss hit a high of 7.1 million BTC last week, which is the highest that it has been since September 2023, more than two years ago. The analytics firm noted: The current scale of supply in loss, ranging between 5M–7M BTC, is strikingly similar to the early-2022 sideways market, further reinforcing the resemblance noted above. Finally, the Bitcoin long-term holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) also implies that the current market structure is mirroring Q1 2022. This metric tells us, in short, whether the Bitcoin investors holding since more than 155 days ago are selling their coins at a profit or loss. The Bitcoin long-term holder SOPR has witnessed a sharp decline recently, but its value is still above 1, indicating the long-term holders are selling at some net profit. With its current value of 1.43, however, there has been a notable shrinkage in the profit margins of the cohort.

    "title": "Why Bitcoin Traders Fear A Repeat Of July 2024’s Crash Next Week",
    "body": "Bitcoin is again trading under the shadow of a potential yen carry-trade shock as markets head into the 9–10 December FOMC meeting and a likely hawkish turn from the Bank of Japan at the December 18-19 meeting. The setup echoes last summer’s episode, when a policy shift in Tokyo triggered rapid deleveraging across risk assets, including crypto. Will The Bitcoin Price Crash Next Week? Analyst Benjamin Cowen explicitly links today’s environment to that July shock. He reminded followers that “in July 2024, the Fed cut rates while the BOJ raised rates, leading to the unwind of the carry trade. Bitcoin capitulated into it, and found a low 1 week later.” He added, “Good chance this happens again on December 10th (Fed cuts, BOJ raises rates). So maybe Bitcoin finds a low mid-Dec?” The precise sequencing last year was more nuanced – markets aggressively priced Fed easing while the BoJ surprised with a hike – but the core mechanism Cowen highlights is the same: when US policy is moving toward looser conditions just as Japan tightens, the long-running yen carry trade becomes unstable and high-beta assets sell off hard. Related Reading: Bitcoin Signals Bear Market: One Thing Could Flip It, Says CryptoQuant CEO Truflation’s thread lays out why this matters for Bitcoin and the wider crypto market. Large institutions and commercial banks “borrow money in Yen where interest rates are historically and famously low, and use that money to invest in the US.” They can park the funds in interest-bearing instruments to “earn healthy 3–4%” on the spread, or “more often, they invest in stocks and bonds to get way more.” This is reinforced by a BoJ policy of keeping the yen cheap against the dollar. The danger arises when stocks fall and the yen starts to rise or is expected to rise. Then “institutional and Commercial borrowers may exit, so as not to get stuck with significant losses on their Yen debts.” They “sell whatever assets they purchased in the US and get back into Yen to pay back their loans in Japan, resulting in a cascade of US asset sales and Yen purchases.” After “years of Yen carry trade being a relatively safe way for big banks and institutional investors to make easy money,” even a modest normalization can force broad, mechanical de-risking — and Bitcoin, as a liquid, leveraged risk asset, sits directly in that firing line. Crypto trader Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) underscores how tight the current window is. He notes that “we have the Fed’s preferred measure to track inflation via the Core PCE inflation and then the FOMC all in the next six days,” followed by a BoJ press conference on 19 December that will be “massive for Dollar, short end and long end of the yield curve not to mention Yen carry trade fears.” In a separate post, he stresses that “the JP10Y continues to make new highs. Pretty big deal folks,” highlighting that Japanese yields are grinding higher into that meeting and increasing pressure on the BoJ to act. Related Reading: US Sen. Lummis Hints At US Bitcoin Buy With ‘Franklin’ Meme A few days ago, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes connected that macro repricing directly to Bitcoin’s latest leg down. “BTC dumped cause BOJ put Dec rate hike in play. USDJPY 155–160 makes BOJ hawkish,” he argues, framing the sell-off as a funding shock rather than a crypto-native event. Into December, futures and economist surveys put the probability of a Fed cut at roughly 80–87% for the 9–10 December meeting, even as the committee remains divided. At the same time, the BoJ is openly signalling it will “consider the pros and cons” of a hike at its 18–19 December meeting, with markets now pricing a high likelihood of tightening and 10-year JGB yields near multi-decade highs. That combination — Fed easing expectations plus BoJ tightening risk — is exactly the configuration that threatens the yen carry and makes a repeat of July 2024’s pattern plausible: a sharp flush in Bitcoin and other risk assets, followed by a bottom once forced deleveraging runs its course. At press time, BTC traded at $92,235. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Fails To Shake Ripple CEO — He Still Calls For $180K According to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, listed spot crypto products may now be offered on exchanges registered with the agency, a move announced on December 4, 2025. Regulated Spot Trading Begins The action comes from a CFTC press release labeled Release No. 9145-25 and that the change allows spot crypto contracts to be listed on futures exchanges that are registered with the CFTC. The regulator said its rules now permit such listings to trade under the oversight and surveillance standards those exchanges already follow. .@CFTCpham Announces First-Ever Listed Spot Crypto Trading on U.S. Regulated Exchanges: https://t.co/89Mx6f0ss4 — CFTC (@CFTC) December 4, 2025 Bitnomial Leads The Way Bitnomial, a Chicago-based derivatives exchange, is set to be the first exchange to list such products, with plans to offer both leveraged and non-leveraged spot trading on its platform. Market notices and statements show Bitnomial moved quickly to use the new framework, announcing a launch and filings that position it as the first US venue to trade listed spot crypto under CFTC rules. What This Means For Investors According to market commentators and reporting, the shift brings spot trades under long-standing market protections like clearing, surveillance and execution rules that apply to other listed products. That can make some institutional players and big funds more willing to trade onshore. At the same time, regulators say this is meant to pull activity away from unregulated offshore venues and improve market oversight. Acting Chairman Caroline Pham said the move is meant to strengthen the US position in the crypto market while giving traders access to safer and more transparent trading venues. Risks Remain Reports have disclosed that the change does not remove the underlying risks of crypto: prices can swing widely, and no regulatory move can stop market volatility. Also, only exchanges that seek and obtain the proper CFTC registration will be able to use this route, so most offshore platforms remain outside US oversight for now. Related Reading: Eric Trump Says Bitcoin Could Hit $500,000, Stands By ABTC Strategy Next Steps Observers will be watching whether other US exchanges follow Bitnomial, how many retail investors gain access, and how the SEC responds on parallel issues such as token classification and custody rules. The CFTC had flagged this pathway in August as part of a broader initiative to allow listed spot crypto trading, and agencies have since coordinated on guidance and public engagement. The CFTC’s Acting Chairman said this brings spot crypto trading into a regulated setting Americans can trust, and that exchanges with the right protections can now list these products. This development is part of a months-long policy push by the administration to create clearer rules for digital assets. Featured image from Barron’s, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Dogecoin Bulls Smell $1.30 As On-Chain Data Turns Red-Hot",
    "body": "Dogecoin is hovering near $0.15, but a cluster of technical and on-chain indicators shared on X suggests the market structure is far healthier than during the last bear phase, prompting fresh upside calls from analysts. Dogecoin Could Target $1.30 Trader Cryptollica posted a long-term monthly DOGE chart with the Mayer Multiple and a clear message: “DOGE Target > $1.30.” The Mayer Multiple, using 200- and 50-period moving averages with a 2.4 threshold, sits at 0.66005. Visually, that is far below the spikes above 5 that accompanied the 2017 and 2021 blow-off tops, indicating that Dogecoin is not yet in the overheated conditions historically associated with major market peaks. Cryptollica also highlighted an Alphractal chart titled “Dogecoin: Number of Days Spent at a Loss.” The series overlays DOGE’s price with a multicolour histogram of how long coins have been held in unrealised loss. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Can Stage A 96% Rally If It Breaks This Falling Wedge Pattern Earlier cycle lows around 2014–2015 and the post-2021 unwind show extended peaks above roughly 1,200–1,500 days at a loss. In the latest segment, that metric has compressed back toward the lower end of the scale, resembling the early reset phases that preceded previous advances, and signalling that the proportion of long-suffering holders has markedly declined. DOGE On-Chain Data Looks Strong On the shorter-term on-chain side, Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) pointed to a sharp rebound in network activity. “Dogecoin just saw 71,589 active addresses. The biggest spike since September,” he wrote, sharing Glassnode data. The chart “DOGE: Number of Active Addresses” plots daily active addresses as yellow bars against the DOGE price in black. From early November, activity ranged around 45,000–47,500 addresses while price drifted lower from about $0.17 to $0.14. On December 3, active addresses jumped to 71,589 as price recovered to $0.15181709, signalling a broadening of participation rather than a purely price-driven move. Ali also drew attention to whale behaviour. Posting a Santiment chart of balances held by addresses with between 1,000,000 and 100,000,000 DOGE, he noted: “480 million Dogecoin bought by whales in 48 hours!” Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bottom In? This Price Level Could Be The Tell The grey area representing holdings in this band trends down from around 35.6 billion DOGE in mid-October to below 28 billion by late November while price falls from above $0.18 to about $0.135, indicating sustained distribution. In the final days of the chart, holdings rose again to roughly 28.45 billion as price rebounded from $0.14 to $0.15, confirming a renewed net accumulation phase among large holders. A third chart from Ali, “DOGE: Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap,” defines the next major technical hurdle. “$0.20 is the key resistance for Dogecoin. That’s where 11.72 billion $DOGE were accumulated,” he wrote. The Glassnode heatmap highlights a dense band between $0.20284609 and $0.20442947, with an annotated supply of 11,723,527,138.97 DOGE whose on-chain cost basis lies in that range. This cluster marks a heavy realised-price node where a large volume of coins moves from loss to breakeven as spot revisits $0.20, creating a clearly defined resistance zone. In combination, subdued valuation on the Mayer Multiple, a reset in “days at a loss,” the largest active-address spike since September, recent whale accumulation of 480 million DOGE and a well-defined $0.20 cost-basis wall form a favourable on-chain basis. Whether those higher levels are reached will depend on the market’s ability to absorb the 11.72 billion DOGE supply stacked around $0.20 and sustain the recent improvement in on-chain activity and large-holder demand. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.14451. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",
