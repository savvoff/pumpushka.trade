    "title": "Saylor’s Strategy Under Threat: Index Status At Risk With $8 Billion On The Line",
    "body": "Michael Saylor’s Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has found itself significantly exposed to the ongoing downturn in the cryptocurrency market, which has seen more than $1 trillion in total market capitalization wiped out over the past month. As the largest public holder of Bitcoin, with over 650,000 coins, the company is now facing the real threat of being removed from major benchmark indices, which have been crucial for its visibility in mainstream portfolios. Analysts Predict Major Impact On Strategy According to a recent Bloomberg report, analysts at JPMorgan Chase have issued a warning that Saylor’s firm may lose its standing in key indices such as MSCI USA and the Nasdaq 100. Related Reading: CEO Cuts Cardano Founder’s Bitcoin Price Forecast, Warns Bear Market Just Starting The analysts assert that this could result in passive outflows estimated between $2.8 billion and $8.8 billion if MSCI proceeds with a decision expected by January 15. Passive funds connected to the company currently account for nearly $9 billion in market exposure, making any index exclusion a substantial blow. Strategy’s business model has relied on a cyclical strategy of selling stock to buy Bitcoin, capitalizing on price rallies, and repeating this process. At its zenith, Saylor’s company’s market capitalization far exceeded the value of its Bitcoin holdings. However, that premium has evaporated, and the company’s valuation now aligns closely with its crypto reserves—a stark indication that investor confidence is fading rapidly. “While active managers are not bound to adhere to index changes, exclusion from major indices would undoubtedly be viewed negatively by market participants,” noted JPMorgan analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. Such a shift could affect liquidity, increase funding costs, and diminish overall investor appeal. MSCI Contemplates New Index Inclusion Rules In its ongoing consultations with stakeholders, MSCI indicated that some market players believe digital asset treasury firms (DATs) may function more like investment funds, which are ineligible for index inclusion. In accordance with these perspectives, MSCI has proposed excluding companies whose holdings in digital assets constitute 50% or more of their total assets from its global investment market indexes. Related Reading: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Bleeds Over $500 Million In Its Biggest One-Day Outflow Since peaking last November, Saylor’s firm has seen its shares (MSTR) decline by over 60%, causing a collapse in the premium that once attracted momentum and crypto-focused investors. Despite this slump, Saylor’s company remains up over 1,300% since he first began purchasing Bitcoin in August 2020, outperforming major equity indices throughout this period. The selloff has extended its reach into the company’s newer funding structures, as well. The prices of its perpetual preferred shares—an essential part of Saylor’s recent strategies—have seen sharp declines. Additionally, yields on securities issued in March have risen to 11.5%, up from a previous 10.5%. A recent euro-denominated preferred stock offering has already dropped below its discounted offering price in under two weeks. Michael Youngworth, head of global convertible bond strategy at Bank of America Global Research, remarked, “That premium has collapsed in recent weeks,” adding that the present situation makes capital raising increasingly challenging.

    "title": "Ethereum Dead Cat Bounce Puts Price At $3,400, But What’s The Ultimate Target?",
    "body": "Ethereum is still struggling after the initial market crash on October 10 that rocked the market. The subsequent market declines have pushed the largest altcoin by market cap toward $3,000, breaking below it for the first time at the start of the week. With the price looking to find support, there is the possibility of a dead count bounce happening that could see the price rise by more than 10%. However, with a dead count bounce being ultimately bearish, the target remains much lower. Why Ethereum Could Be Headed Lower Crypto analyst TradingShot, in a recent analysis, outlined how the Ethereum price looks to be caught in a bearish trend since early October. This had first begun after the altcoin put in a new all-time high just above $4,900 before being hit hard in the October 10 market-wide crash. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Surge Above $1 As It Repeats This Trend From 2023-2024 Since then, the digital asset has been caught within a Channel Down. This Channel Down is what triggered the double-digit decline that has been recorded for the altcoin since then. As the crypto analyst explains, the Ethereum price has seen a 27.50% decline on both of its bearish legs since this trend was established. Recently, though, there has been a small turn in the tide after the price dropped below $3,000, and this happened after Ethereum formed higher lows on the 1-Day RSI. Mostly, this is bullish for the cryptocurrency’s price, but the catch is that it is likely only going to be so for the short term. If the bullish divergence does play out as expected, then the Ethereum price is definitely set for some recovery. TradingShot believes that this recovery could bring the ETH price up by 10%, pushing it up to $3,400 before the bears step back in again. However, the overall trend still remains bearish, and this could act as a hindrance to this recovery. Once the bears mount enough resistance to stop the rally in its tracks, it is expected that the decline will resume. If this plays out, then it could mean that the recovery was only a dead cat bounce. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Keeps Crashing- Is $80,000 Next? This $3,400 level lies at the 1-Day MA50, which is important because it was the point of rejection back on October 27. Last time, it led to a 27.50% crash for the Ethereum price. This time, once the sell-offs begin again, the crypto analyst believes that this could trigger a sharp crash below $3,000. The timeframe for this ranges from the end of November to the start of December, giving it only a couple of weeks to play out. The crash is expected to push Ethereum down to $2,650 before finding a bottom, marking a new lower low. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Tom Lee Knows Why the Crypto Market Crashed: $BEST May Be the Safest Investment Now",
    "body": "The October 10 crypto crash wasn’t just another violent wick on the chart. According to Tom Lee, chairman of Ether-focused treasury and market-making firm BitMine, the selloff exposed “structural weaknesses” within major liquidity providers that only become visible when volatility hits hard. Speaking with CNBC , Lee said the record liquidation cascade, nearly $20B wiped out in hours, forced over-leveraged market makers to rapidly unwind positions as collateral values sank. That derisking drained liquidity from order books, widened spreads, and accelerated the crash in a classic feedback loop. For regular users, that kind of liquidity vacuum isn’t just macro noise. It’s when swaps fail, fees spike, and centralized wallet pipelines become bottlenecks precisely when you need them most. When the infrastructure you rely on cracks under pressure, you’re effectively outsourcing your survival to someone else’s balance sheet. That’s why many investors are now shifting their focus from price action to tools that hold up during stress. Best Wallet is positioning its presale around that exact narrative: a mobile-first, non-custodial ecosystem built to keep users in control even when market plumbing breaks elsewhere. In a post-crash environment where structural fragility is once again front and center, that message is resonating. How a Market-Maker Liquidity Crunch Spills Into Everyday Crypto Use Lee’s point is simple but uncomfortable: when major market makers run aggressively leveraged books, a shock like the October 10, 2025, crash can flip a liquidity provider into a forced seller almost instantly. Once those books start unwinding, liquidity doesn’t just thin, it evaporates. Slippage spikes, execution quality drops, and long-tail tokens or smaller venues become structurally untradeable for hours. We’ve seen versions of this story before. Centralized exchanges and brokerages often look stable right up until volatility reveals mismatched liabilities or overextended positions. For everyday users, the question is painfully practical: How do you trade, route liquidity, or rebalance portfolios without being dependent on a single entity’s balance sheet or uptime when markets are blowing up? Different wallets are attempting their own solutions. MetaMask is leaning hard into smarter routing and institutional integrations. Trust Wallet focuses on simplicity and broad asset support for casual users. Phantom expanded from Solana to EVM chains to capture multichain retail flow. Best Wallet Token , currently in presale, aims to join this field from a different angle, pairing a consumer-grade mobile UX with a security-centric backend built on Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP infrastructure. In a cycle where liquidity reliability is suddenly front-page news again, that positioning stands out. Why Best Wallet Is Positioning Itself as “Crash-Resistant” Infrastructure Most wallets still act as thin front-ends. Best Wallet is taking a different route, building a full-stack, volatility-aware ecosystem that assumes turbulence is the norm, not the exception. The team is openly targeting 40% of the global wallet market by the end of 2026, aiming at users who want institutional-grade security packaged inside a mobile-first interface. At its core is what the team calls the first fully integrated Fireblocks MPC-CMP wallet, housed within a retail app. Instead of relying on a single private key, multi-party computation splits signing across independent shards, eliminating a single-point-of-failure while keeping transactions fast enough for everyday trading. The app’s multi-wallet portfolio system lets users cleanly separate long-term holdings, active trading, and experimental positions without juggling addresses. Beyond storage, the product places a strong emphasis on access. The Upcoming Tokens portal curates early-stage presales and embeds a streamlined purchase flow, allowing users to participate in vetted launches without jumping through third-party sites. The Best DEX aggregator , powered by Rubic, pulls routes from multiple chains, DEXs, and cross-chain bridges, optimizing trades for both price and execution in real-time. On the token side, $BEST is designed to tie utility directly to user activity. Holders receive reduced in-app fees and can stake into a dedicated 800M-token rewards pool (8% of supply). Payouts scale proportionally with each staker’s share of the pool, and staking is live during the presale, giving early buyers a head start on compounding. That pitch appears to be resonating. The presale has already raised over $17.2M with tokens priced at $0.025975 and just 7 days remaining. Whale-tracking data shows two recent large purchases totaling $136k, including a confirmed $56K buy on September 2, 2025, a signal that some larger players are willing to take early directional exposure. For anyone recalibrating after the October 2025 crypto crash, tools like Best Wallet offer a more constructive response than trying to time the exact bottom. Rather than betting on perfect entries, you can build a stack that remains flexible, fee-efficient, and self-custodial the next time liquidity disappears without warning. Join the $BEST presale today. This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial, investment, or trading advice.

    "title": "Why The Bitcoin Crash To $85,000 Is Actually Good News: Jeff Park",
    "body": "With Bitcoin trading around $85,000, Jeff Park, Partner and CIO at ProCap BTC, used his Nov. 20 conversation with Anthony Pompliano to argue that the drop may be valuable for reasons that have little to do with short-term “dip buying” and everything to do with narrative regime change. His central claim is that the classic halving-anchored rhythm is losing its foundation. Why The Bitcoin Crash Is Necessary “The four year cycle is almost definitively over,” Park said, because what it was “based off of historically, which is the halving, is just irrelevant from the additional marginal demand that comes from other channels that have opened up.” In his framing, the market is being pulled into a different cadence: “logically and fundamentally the four-year cycle should no longer exist and a new cycle should emerge that is more in sync with institutional risk capital appetite.” Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Fidelity Research Lead Weighs The Odds Park is careful not to treat that as a clean break, because beliefs still move prices. He stressed that a large legacy cohort continues to trade as if the four-year script is real. “There is still a big group of investors that believe it should exist,” he said, describing them as early adopters with “characteristics that almost feel like the occult where they have prophecies.” The key, in his view, is their supply control: “the biggest Bitcoin holders in wallets that are 10,000 [BTC] and plus in size still control a good chunk of the market they are still a third of the Bitcoin market.” That concentration makes the cycle potentially reflexive: “if a third of the Bitcoin holders believe the four-year cycle is true and they act like the four-year cycle is true, well then it doesn’t really matter because they’re the price setters […] these things can be self-fulfilling.” From there, Park pivots to why weakness into year-end could be constructive. He noted that Bitcoin is now “below year to date […] in 2025,” raising the prospect of a red close. In a deliberately sharp line, he joked that if 2025 ends negative, “that breaks the four-year cycle because now we have a red [yearly candle] and so it’s a three-year cycle.” Related Reading: Why Bitwise Thinks Bitcoin Still Hits $200,000 In 2026 The humor masks a strategic preference: “maybe we do need this red [candle] right now so we could have the ability to unleash the super cycle for Bitcoin to come without ever having to talk about the four-year cycle again.” Park framed a marginally green close as the worst of both worlds. “The last thing I want honestly is […] an up 5% year to 2025 where we close at like $98K or $99K or $100K and that counts as a green year,” he said, because then “the next year everyone’s going to talk about […] this is the down year now,” leaving 2026 under the “harrowing weight over your head that we’re actually going to have another down year.” Pompliano pressed the obvious counter-scenario: “Is there a world where it could just kind of rip right back […] and go to $140,000 or something?” Park didn’t rule it out. “It’s absolutely possible. Anything can happen,” he replied. But he summarized the trade-off starkly: “we either have to hope for […] that it either goes up a lot to make the year count or we just try to notch in a small loss here for the year so we can just wipe out the four-year cycle altogether.” For Park, Bitcoin at $85,000 is “good news” only insofar as it increases the odds of breaking a self-reinforcing calendar myth, clearing the way for a market driven less by halving folklore and more by institutional risk cycles. At press time, BTC traded at $84,469. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

The Washington opening, where Bessent appeared unannounced, triggered a flurry of online reaction. Some community figures called the moment historic. Others urged caution, saying public appearances do not automatically translate into policy shifts. Had to do a second buy today using my “it was so obvious” framework. Having the Secretary of the Treasury at the Pubkey DC launch seems like a moment I could easily look back on and say “wow, it was all so obvious”. Stack Sats and chill. https://t.co/8uPWEqLJ9y pic.twitter.com/Dew1A4gkFZ — Ben Werkman (@BenWerkman) November 21, 2025 Policy Signals And Concrete Talk Based on reports, Bessent has been public about ideas that place Bitcoin on the government agenda. He has spoken about the GENIUS Act and has discussed ways the Treasury could use seized Bitcoin to seed a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in a budget-neutral manner. In an interview dated March 7, 2025, he suggested the Treasury was exploring options that would avoid immediate sales of seized crypto and instead look for ways to keep BTC on the books. That shift in tone is being watched closely by traders and policy watchers alike. Community Reaction Was Fast Ben Werkman, a crypto fund CIO, said the event felt like a “moment” for the industry. Another industry figure, Steven Lubka, called it the sign many had been waiting for. At the same time, analysts warned about reading too much into a single photo op. One trader noted that market moves are driven by many forces, and that symbolic gestures often take time to matter for prices. Short-term traders may ignore signals like this, while longer-term holders may file them away. What This Means For Markets And Lawmakers If the Treasury takes steps to pause sales of seized BTC and to test ways of holding coins, the move could change how institutional players view the asset class. But reports also remind readers that policy ideas meet legal and budget tests before they become real. Lawmakers and regulators will have to weigh the proposal. The public nature of Bessent’s visit, though, makes the discussion harder to treat as private or theoretical. Related Reading: XRP Supply Shock Ahead? ETFs Could Consume It All, Analyst Predicts A Moment, Not A Promise The image of a cabinet official mingling at a Bitcoin bar is powerful. It gives the community talking points. Yet, officials and experts say more formal steps are required before the visit becomes policy. For now, the appearance stands as a public sign of interest, backed by statements and proposals that are still in play. Bitcoin’s supporters will note the visibility. Critics will watch for the paperwork. Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by vvelda@ymail.com/Flickr and Wavebreakmedia/iStock/Getty Images Plus, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "Recent data has revealed the demographics of sellers driving the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin crash. The Coinbase BTC premium index also continues to drop further in the red, which strengthens the case of where exactly the sell pressure is coming from. The Demographic Behind The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Price Crash In an X post, crypto pundit Crypto Rover noted that the U.S. session has been the weakest trading session so far this month. The pundit further shared an accompanying chart, which showed that BTC has suffered a loss of around 12% in the U.S. session since the start of November, also leading to the Ethereum and Dogecoin crash. Related Reading: Why Are The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Down Again? Meanwhile, the EU has had the second-weakest session after the U.S., with Bitcoin dropping around 12% in this session since the start of this month. The Asian session has been the least volatile, with BTC trading sideways, recording a drawdown of only about 2% since the start of November. Ethereum, Dogecoin, and altcoins have also been stable during the Asian trading session. Crypto pundit Bossman also indicated that the U.S. was responsible for most of the sell pressure that is driving the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin crash. In an X post, he noted that every single American session is marked by relentless selling for hours. Meanwhile, the Asians wake up, buy it all back, and then the Americans wake up, and the selling begins again. Notably, the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices record increased volatility whenever the U.S. stock market opens, with market commentator Zerohedge attributing it to the ‘10 am slam’ by market algos. This indicates that institutional investors are heavily contributing to the market crash. This is evident in the significant outflows recorded by Bitcoin ETFs in recent times. These funds have recorded five daily net outflows over the last seven days, according to SoSoValue data. Coinbase BTC Premium Index In The Red CoinGlass data shows that the Coinbase Bitcoin premium index is in the red, further confirming that most of the sell pressure driving the BTC, Ethereum, and Dogecoin crash is coming from the U.S. Typically, a negative premium indicates that the BTC price on Coinbase is lower than the average global price, which signals weak demand from U.S. investors. Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Price October Top Is Back With A New Prediction Crypto researcher Kyle Soska noted that Bitcoin and Ethereum are roughly 10 days into a derisking event by U.S.-based entities, likely a combination of ETF users and large private, ultra-high-net-worth individuals. He further remarked that this places the market near the end of the selling episode based on historical data. Soska opined that the first of a near-term bottom would be a mean reversion of the Coinbase-Binance spot discount from its current level of around -$110 back to a more normal level range of around $40. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $85,000, down over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "Just One Week Left Before Best Wallet Token’s Explosive $17M Presale Ends",
    "body": "What to Know: Many crypto wallets remain either centralized with single points of failure or decentralized yet fragmented and challenging to use on mobile. Users now expect a secure, cross-chain, yield-enabled wallet experience rather than a simple send-and-receive tool. The Best Wallet targets a 40% share of the global wallet market by end-2026 with a mobile-first, benefit-rich, non-custodial design. Fireblocks’ MPC, Rubic’s DEX aggregator, and curated presale access position the Best Wallet’s $BEST presale as a full DeFi command center. Crypto is in another risk-on phase, and you can see it in where capital is flowing. While meme coins still grab headlines, more money is rotating into infrastructure plays that actually solve user pain points, especially around self-custody, security, and cross-chain access. Wallets sit at the center of that shift. If you have used multiple apps, chains, and DEXs, you know the problem. Most of the best crypto wallet contenders are either custodial with clear single points of failure, or non-custodial but clunky on mobile and fragmented across chains. You get basic send and swap options, but not real advantages like curated presales, better yields, or integrated fee discounts. That gap is where Best Wallet is moving fast. Positioning itself as a next-gen crypto wallet, it combines institutional-grade MPC security and a mobile-first design. And now, thanks to its Best Wallet Token ($BEST), it’s adding a benefits layer that goes far beyond just holding tokens. 💡 The idea is simple: make self-custody feel as easy as a fintech app, but with deep DeFi hooks. With the $BEST presale already raising more than $17.2M and only a week left on the clock, Best Wallet Token is pushing to become a serious contender for users searching for the best crypto wallet experience, not just another token punt. ➡️ Learn more about the project’s fundamentals in our Best Wallet Token review, and explore detailed $BEST price forecasts to understand the full token outlook. Best Wallet Presale Targets Mass Adoption with Real User Benefits At its core, Best Wallet wants to be the wallet you actually use every day, not just another app in a folder. It is a non-custodial, no-KYC mobile wallet with multi-chain support, while integrating staking, DEX aggregation, and presale access into one streamlined interface via the Upcoming Tokens portal. The security story is anchored by a fully integrated Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP setup, so you get institutional-grade key management without seed phrases being your single point of failure. For users, the pitch is straightforward. Hold and use $BEST to reduce fees across the Best Wallet ecosystem, unlock higher APY opportunities through a staking aggregator, and get earlier, simpler access to new presales that have passed an internal vetting process. That’s in addition to governance rights. 💰 The presale has already raised over $17.2M, underscoring clear demand for a more feature-rich, mobile-first wallet stack. $BEST currently costs $0.025975 and you can stake it for 76% APY. Can $BEST Be More Than Just Another Presale Token? If Best Wallet captures even a small slice of the broader wallet market, $BEST could potentially reach levels that deliver multiple returns from the current presale price of $0.025975. 🐳 Momentum is already showing on-chain, with smart money moving in. High-net-worth wallets snapped up $BEST tokens in chunks with whale buys of $70.2K and $50K. Combine staking incentives, reduced ecosystem fees, and exclusive presale access, and you get a clear utility loop where active users are rewarded for staying inside the Best Wallet ecosystem rather than hopping between random apps or meme coins. If you are looking beyond hype-driven narratives and toward durable wallet infrastructure, this is one presale you may want on your radar. 🚨 A heads up, though. The Best Wallet Token presale is entering its final stretch with just one week before it ends. November 28 is D-day, so the clock is ticking if you want to join the presale. With a mobile-first non-custodial wallet, Fireblocks MPC security, DEX aggregation, and presale access built in, Best Wallet and its native $BEST token offer a more stable and utility-driven alternative to purely speculative plays. If you are searching for the best crypto wallet experience that bundles security, access, and rewards into one app, $BEST is positioning itself as a potential core holding rather than a side bet. 🚀 Secure $BEST before the presale ends next week.

    "body": "CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju pushed back on a renewed wave of forced Bitcoin liquidation and bankruptcy chatter around Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy, MSTR), arguing that the bearish thesis misreads the company’s capital structure and shareholder incentives. In a Nov. 20, 2025 post on X, Ju wrote, “MSTR only goes bankrupt if an asteroid hits Earth,” adding that critics should “bring a single piece of evidence” before claiming Michael Saylor would be liquidated. The comments came as Bitcoin and high-beta crypto proxies retraced into late November, reviving legacy narratives that Strategy’s debt stack could compel BTC sales. Why Strategy Will Never Sell Bitcoin Ju’s central claim is that Strategy is not structurally set up like a margin trader. Addressing the most common fear—that convertible notes “missing” their conversion price forces liquidation—he stated: “Convertible debt not reaching the conversion price is not liquidation. It simply means the notes get repaid in cash Failing to convert is not a bankruptcy trigger. It is just normal debt maturity.” Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Fidelity Research Lead Weighs The Odds In his view, the repayment pathways are conventional corporate finance tools: refinancing, rolling into new notes, secured borrowing, or operating cash flow. That framing aligns with how convertibles function in practice; if equity is below strike at maturity, the embedded option expires and the instrument reverts to straight debt rather than a forced-sale event. He also grounded his argument in governance and identity. “Saylor would never sell Bitcoin unless shareholders want it,” Ju wrote, warning that “selling even a single BTC would destroy MSTR’s identity as a Bitcoin treasury company and trigger a death spiral for both Bitcoin and MSTR.” Strategy has repeatedly defined itself as a BTC-treasury vehicle, and its shareholder base largely bought into that mandate, making voluntary divestment politically and strategically improbable absent a radical shift in investor preference. Balance-sheet data underpins Ju’s confidence. Strategy reported 640,808 BTC as of Oct. 30, 2025, acquired for about $47.44 billion; subsequent filings cited major November additions taking holdings to roughly 649,870 BTC. Even after accounting for the growing convertible and preferred layers, the BTC treasury remains the dominant asset, meaning solvency stress would require an extreme, prolonged Bitcoin collapse rather than a cyclical drawdown. Related Reading: Why Bitwise Thinks Bitcoin Still Hits $200,000 In 2026 Ju did not claim the equity is risk-free. “This does not mean MSTR’s stock price will always stay high,” he wrote, but called the idea that Strategy would sell BTC to support the stock or face imminent bankruptcy “completely absurd.” He added that even at a price of $10,000 per coin, Strategy would face “a debt restructuring, nothing more.” On preferred shares, he acknowledged dividend obligations, noting payments have not been missed and can be covered via new share issuance—dilutive, but not a liquidation vector. Posting BTC as collateral, he said, would be a last resort because that would introduce real margin risk. In short, Ju’s rebuttal draws a hard line between volatility and insolvency: Strategy may trade like leveraged Bitcoin, but its liabilities do not mechanically force BTC sales. The “Saylor liquidation” narrative, he argues, is a Twitter myth unless the world ends—by asteroid. At press time, BTC traded at $82,050.

    "title": "Best Altcoins to Buy as Cycle Is Turning & Promises Alt Season Soon",
    "body": "What to Know: Bitcoin Hyper’s modular Bitcoin L1 + SVM L2 architecture enables low-latency smart contracts and DeFi to run natively within the BTC ecosystem. With more than $28 million raised in its presale, $HYPER is positioning itself as a high-conviction Bitcoin infrastructure play ahead of a potential altcoin rotation. Best Wallet Presale blends institutional-grade MPC security with presale discovery tools and a robust DEX aggregator, aligning its growth with rising on-chain activity. Aster offers a MEV-free perp DEX with extreme leverage and yield-bearing margin mechanics, creating direct exposure to resurging derivatives volatility. Altcoin season indicators are starting to flicker even while most portfolios still feel like a bear market hangover. Only around 5% of the altcoin supply is in profit, a level that historically lines up with capitulation, forced selling and exhaustion among weaker hands. That kind of reset is usually where new cycles begin to form underneath the surface. And keen eyes are already starting to point out the potential for big moves. Bitcoin’s dominance has marched higher during this phase, with capital crowding into $BTC as a safe haven while high‑beta assets bleed out. As Bitcoin volatility compresses and price action stabilizes, analysts expect the early rotation phase of an altcoin season to develop. Liquidity typically leaks first into higher‑quality infrastructure and trading venues before it reaches meme coins. You can already see that playbook in motion. On‑chain flows and presale data show capital quietly rotating into Bitcoin Layer 2 infrastructure, next‑generation wallet stacks and execution‑focused decentralized exchanges. These are the rails that will need to scale if a new wave of users and speculative flows really hit the market. Below are three of the best altcoins to invest in 2025 if you are positioning ahead of a potential cycle flip: Bitcoin Hyper , Best Wallet Token , and Aster. Together they cover settlement, custody and trading, the three pillars of a functioning on‑chain market structure. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) — First Bitcoin Layer 2 With SVM Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is pitched as the first ever Bitcoin Layer 2 with SVM integration, aiming to give Bitcoin the kind of high‑throughput execution environment traders currently associate with Solana. Instead of trying to replace $BTC, Bitcoin Hyper uses Bitcoin L1 purely as a settlement and security layer while shifting all real‑time activity to a Solana Virtual Machine Layer 2. That architecture matters if altcoin season really does return. DeFi, NFT activity and high‑frequency perp trading cannot live on 10‑minute blocks and inconsistent fees. Bitcoin Hyper’s SVM Layer 2 targets sub‑second confirmation and low‑single‑cent fees, which is crucial for wrapped $BTC payments, DEX routing and gaming dApps where users will not tolerate latency. On the application side, Bitcoin Hyper leans into SPL‑compatible tokens, fast smart contracts and an SDK in Rust so existing Solana developers can port over almost instantly. The roadmap calls for $BTC‑backed stable payments, lending markets, staking protocols and NFT platforms that settle back to Bitcoin but operate at L2 speed. The token metrics tell you this is already on trader radar: The presale has raised $28.2M $HYPER priced at $0.013305 Major whale buys, including $502K and $379K That combination of broad retail participation plus clear ‘smart money’ entries is the pattern you usually see before a main exchange listing; learn how to buy $HYPER before the presale ends and the token goes live. In a market hunting for the best altcoins to invest as the cycle turns, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as a direct play on bringing Solana‑style throughput to Bitcoin’s security base layer. Learn more and join the $HYPER presale. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) — Aggregating the Next Cycle’s Flow If Bitcoin Hyper is the execution layer for BTC liquidity, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) positions itself as the front door where that liquidity is actually stored, routed and deployed. The project’s ambition is aggressive, targeting up to 40% of the crypto wallet market by the end of 2026 by being the easiest and safest option with the most integrated features. Its core differentiator is a Fireblocks MPC‑CMP stack under the hood, which is the same class of infrastructure used by large institutions for secure key management. On top of that, Best Wallet lets you build custom multi‑wallet portfolios, so you can segment long‑term holdings, trading stacks and DeFi experiments with granular risk controls instead of juggling a dozen browser extensions. Where this starts to intersect directly with altcoin season is the Upcoming Tokens portal. The wallet integrates a curated presale and early‑stage token flow so users can access vetted opportunities without leaving the interface. For traders hunting the best altcoins to invest in 2025 before they hit centralized exchanges, integrated discovery and purchase rails are a real edge. The Best DEX aggregator, powered by Rubic, then connects to more than 50 chains, 200 DEXs and 20 cross‑chain bridges to execute at competitive rates. On the token side, the $BEST presale has already raised $17.2M, with tokens priced at $0.025975, supported by a dynamic staking APY model that adjusts with demand and protocol revenue. Whale buys include purchases of $70K and $50K ; learn how to join them . If inflows into infrastructure and presales accelerate with a new cycle, Best Wallet’s position as one of the best crypto wallets is structurally tied to that growth. Check the $BEST presale details. 3. Aster ($ASTER) — High‑Leverage Perp DEX Positioned for Volatility The third piece of the puzzle is where traders will actually express high‑beta views if altcoin season kicks in. Aster is a next‑generation decentralized exchange for spot and perpetual trading, designed to operate as a one‑stop on‑chain venue for global crypto traders. It competes in the same lane as GMX, Hyperliquid and MUX, but leans heavily into performance plus capital efficiency. Aster’s headline features are eye‑catching: MEV‑free execution, support for leverage up to 1001x and the ability to use yield‑bearing assets as margin collateral. In practice, that means a trader can deploy staked stablecoins or liquid staking tokens, keep yield flowing and still open directional positions, which is particularly attractive when volatility spikes. Multi‑chain compatibility across BNB Chain, Ethereum, Solana and Arbitrum keeps Aster accessible wherever users currently hold their collateral. Recent activity has been strong. Aster rolled out its Rocket Launch campaign with APRO, allocating a $200K ASTER reward pool and broader trading incentives to bootstrap depth and activity. During peak periods, reported volumes have pushed Aster into the upper ranks of perpetual DEXs, at times surpassing Hyperliquid. For traders rotating out of centralized venues and looking for high‑leverage, MEV‑resistant execution, Aster is positioned squarely in the slipstream of any renewed speculative mania. Explore Aster on its official site. With altcoin season signals flickering while most supply sits deeply underwater, positioning into infrastructure makes sense. Bitcoin Hyper , Best Wallet Token and Aster each target critical layers of the next cycle’s stack, with Bitcoin Hyper offering the most asymmetric way to play a Bitcoin Layer 2 resurgence.

    "title": "Data Rings Alarm: Bitcoin Hits 2-Year Bearish Extreme — Historically Bullish?",
    "body": "According to CryptoQuant data, Bitcoin has moved into what analysts are calling the most bearish phase of the last two years, sending prices down sharply and weighing on the broader crypto market. Related Reading: XRP Supply Shock Ahead? ETFs Could Consume It All, Analyst Predicts The coin slid from a peak above $126,000 on Oct. 6 to $83,790, a drop of around 34% that erased roughly $715 billion in market value. Bull Conditions Have Weakened Rapidly Reports have disclosed that CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index fell to 20 out of 100 last week, driven by weak spot buying, negative price momentum, and a slowdown in stablecoin liquidity. Bitcoin also closed below its 365-day moving average, a long-run trendline that had held during earlier pullbacks in the current cycle that began in January 2023. Based on these signs, CryptoQuant views the market as clearly more bearish than it was in prior corrections. Trading desks and corporate treasuries have shifted behavior. Treasury companies that once supported prices have seen market values drop by 70% to more than 90% in recent months, limiting their ability to issue shares and buy more Bitcoin. Reports show Michael Saylor’s Strategy bought 8,178 BTC earlier this week but has slowed purchases as its stock market cap fell closer to the value of its holdings. ETF flows have also turned negative, with outflows totaling close to $3 billion so far this month, a dynamic that can force some institutions to sell spot holdings if spread trades are unwound. Technical Levels And Short-Term Signals Based on on-chain indicators, there are mixed signals for buyers. Glassnode reported the Mayer Multiple moving toward the bottom of its long-term range, which often signals a value-driven phase where buyers re-enter. Bitcoin’s Mayer Multiple has retraced toward the lower bound of its long-term range, signalling a slowdown in momentum. Historically, such compressions have aligned with value-driven phases where price consolidates and demand begins to step in. 📈https://t.co/QWQCUxgUoA pic.twitter.com/qufyp0opnr — glassnode (@glassnode) November 20, 2025 Some technical traders see oversold readings on daily and weekly RSI, a setup that could allow a bounce. Some analysts expect at least a short-term recovery, with price tests above $100,000 possible if buying returns. Still, the breakdown under the 365-day average changes the picture. CryptoQuant suggested resistance near $102,600 could prove heavy, and the support band between $90,000 and $92,000 will be closely watched. Historically, Bitcoin has produced rallies of 40% to 50% inside broader downtrends, so rapid reversals are not out of the question even in a bearish phase. Market Shock And Macro Factors Based on reports, the sharp sell-off that triggered the recent crash began on October 10 when a large leverage flush-out forced many positions to close. Market makers reduced liquidity and selling pressure intensified. A software fault tied to the Athena USDE stablecoin on Binance briefly pushed its peg to $0.65, triggering automated liquidations across platforms and accelerating losses. Related Reading: Trump’s WLFI Moves To Contain Wallet Breach While Federal Inquiry Looms Macro worries, including tighter liquidity and political uncertainty, added pressure and sent more traders to the exits. Some observers have linked parts of the 2024 and 2025 rallies to specific events. In 2024, US President Donald Trump’s election was one factor cited for pushing BTC above $100,000, and in 2025, a wave of corporate treasuries bought Bitcoin, helping lift prices above $120,000 in summer months. According to CryptoQuant, those catalysts have largely played out, and any new triggers may be priced in already. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "STH Panic Emerges as Bitcoin Crashes To $81K: Realized P/L Turns Negative For The First Time This Cycle",
    "body": "Bitcoin is struggling to find support after losing the $85,000 level and plunging to $81,000, marking its weakest point since early spring. Bulls have clearly lost control of the trend, and fear now dominates the market, with sentiment rapidly shifting from caution to outright panic. Many traders are calling for a confirmed bear market, while others argue the move is an orchestrated shakeout designed to flush out weak hands before the next macro leg. Related Reading: Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden Deposits Final 2,499 BTC ($228M) to Kraken – Details Amid the chaos, top analyst Axel Adler shared new insights that highlight a structural shift beneath the surface. Until just yesterday, short-term holders (STHs) appeared relatively stable despite the correction. However, the situation has now changed dramatically. The Realized P/L component — which measures whether investors are selling at a profit or loss — has fallen to –1, signaling broad loss realization across the STH cohort. This metric turning negative for the first time in weeks confirms that capitulation among recent buyers is accelerating, a dynamic that historically increases pressure on the spot market. Although the sell-off is severe, some analysts argue that these conditions resemble previous manipulation-driven liquidity grabs, where deep corrections eventually set the foundation for sharp rebounds. STH Panic Mirrors Past Cyclical Bottom Signals Adler explains that the latest spike in short-term holder (STH) panic is not an isolated event — it closely resembles patterns seen during previous market bottoms. The chart clearly shows that similar surges in STH loss realization occurred in July 2021 and again throughout the 2022–2023 bear market, each time leading to accelerated selling, liquidity stress, and deeper short-term corrections. These phases were marked by fear-driven capitulation, where recent buyers dumped coins rapidly, often exaggerating the downside but ultimately exhausting available sell pressure. Today, that same structure is reappearing. With STH Realized P/L dropping sharply and the STH-MVRV ratio sitting below 1, fear has pushed many recent entrants into loss, triggering panic moves. Adler notes that this kind of forced selling tends to cluster near the end of corrections, not the beginning. Once STHs capitulate, the market often shifts into a period of stabilization as long-term holders absorb supply. Despite extreme sentiment across social and derivative markets, several analysts argue that this setup could create the conditions for a recovery. Historically, when STH panic peaks and long-term holders remain steady, Bitcoin has often staged strong rebounds in the weeks that follow. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mean Reversion Oscillator Prints First Green Oversold Bar in Months – A Classic Bull-Market Bottom Signal BTC Testing Key Demand Levels Bitcoin has entered a steep downtrend, and the chart clearly reflects the intensity of the current sell-off. BTC has dropped to the $83K–$84K range, marking one of the sharpest declines of this cycle. The breakdown accelerated once price lost the $92K and $90K supports, and the chart now shows a near-vertical move to the downside — a classic sign of capitulation-driven selling. On the daily timeframe, BTC is trading well below the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages. All three have begun sloping downward, forming a full bearish alignment that signals weakening momentum across multiple time horizons. Price is currently attempting to stabilize around the 200-day moving average (red line), one of the last major trend supports in a macro bull structure. A clean close below this level could open the door to deeper downside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Capitulation Deepens Around $90K Level: Classic Late-Stage Fear Structure Emerging Volume has spiked aggressively over the past sessions, confirming panic participation. Unlike earlier corrections, this one shows sustained distribution without meaningful bounces, suggesting forced selling from short-term holders and large entities. However, the chart also shows early signs of selling exhaustion. Candles are printing long lower wicks, and intraday volatility has increased — conditions that often precede a temporary bottom.

    "title": "XRP Price Has Surged 15% Anytime This Metric Appeared In The Past",
    "body": "Analysts note that the XRP price is showing unusual resilience, as a key metric previously seen before short-term rebounds reappears on its chart. In a new technical analysis, crypto market expert Dom points out that the latest market setup mirrors conditions that have led to at least a 10% surge each time this pattern emerges. Recurring Metric Signals 10% XRP Price Surge In an X post released while XRP was still trading around $2.19, Dom highlighted a familiar technical signal, noting that past appearances of a bid-skew metric on the chart have consistently led to sharp price recoveries. As a reflection of its previous stability, the analyst stated the XRP had displayed incredible strength over the last several days, trading above the $2 level. Related Reading: Analyst Claims XRP Price Will Surge To $220 Due To ETFs, But Is This Possible? Even as the Bitcoin price plummeted by more than $15,000 in the past few days, the analyst pointed out that XRP had maintained its local low from November 5. The accompanying chart highlights this divergence between XRP and BTC, where the altcoin’s structure holds its range despite the widespread market downturn. Historically, when XRP has shown such strength during periods of Bitcoin weakness, Dom notes that it has signaled countless price reversals. The analyst further highlighted that over the past three months, every time the recurring bid-skew pattern appeared, XRP followed with an upswing of at least 10%. If the historical metric holds, Dom’s analysis suggests there could be a continuation of XRP’s recent resilience, potentially driving its price up by 10% to at least $2.09. At the time of the analyst’s post, this target may have been higher, since XRP was still trading above $2. However, the cryptocurrency has since fallen below that threshold, reaching $1.9 at the time of writing. XRP CVD Data Reveals Controlled Selling Pressure In a subsequent update, Dom shared a second chart, showing that XRP’s price had declined from its previous level of $2.19 to $2.01. He highlighted that this negative price action serves as a reminder that market dynamics don’t always follow textbook patterns. The recent decline in XRP also falls into roughly 15% of cases where typical orderbook signals fail to predict short-term moves. Related Reading: Here’s How High The XRP Price Needs To Be To Flip Bitcoin In the Binance spot market, Dom points out evidence of “controlled” selling rather than forced liquidations. Unlike earlier periods where strong bids consistently led to upward price momentum, XRP’s Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) curves on Binance, Coinbase, Bybit, and other exchanges are sloping downwards. Moreover, among all the crypto exchanges, Binance has recorded the most decline. Dom notes that controlled selling can be seen clearly in the smoothed cumulative volume lines on the chart. He warns that these developments are tricky to time. Moreover, without a sudden climax or sharp liquidation, bottoming could form slowly, making entries based on traditional reversal signals more challenging.

    "title": "$400 Million XRP Offloaded in Just 48 Hours, What’s Behind the Massive Sell Pressure?",
    "body": "XRP has been hit by one of its most aggressive sell waves this year, with on-chain data revealing that major whale wallets offloaded nearly 200 million XRP, roughly $400 million, within just 48 hours. Related Reading: Ethereum Dead Cat Bounce Puts Price At $3,400, But What’s The Ultimate Target? According to Santiment analytics, wallets holding between one million and ten million tokens were the primary contributors, adding significant sell-side liquidity to an already fragile market. This sudden influx of supply arrived at a time when XRP was already battling bearish sentiment across the broader crypto space. The asset slipped 10.32% in 24 hours, falling below the key $2 psychological level, touching lows near $1.85, and posting double-digit losses within a single day. XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Extreme Fear Grips the Market Market indicators paint a grim picture. XRP is trading below both its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages, signalling sustained downward momentum. The Fear & Greed Index sits at 14, firmly in “extreme fear” territory, while selling volume surged past $7.2 billion in 24 hours. Analysts warn that a failure to reclaim resistance near $2.30 could open the door to deeper losses, with short-term projections suggesting a potential drop toward $1.50 if bearish pressure continues. The weakness is not isolated to XRP. Bitcoin’s retreat below the $85,000 zone and Ethereum’s slide below $3,000 have triggered market-wide liquidations, with macro uncertainty adding fuel. Concerns over a possible delay in Federal Reserve rate cuts, driven by soft U.S. jobs data and rising unemployment, have dented investor appetite for risk assets across the board. Will XRP Stabilize or Sink Further? The big question now is whether whales will continue distributing or pause their offloading. If no new wave of large-scale selling emerges, analysts believe XRP could stabilize and attempt to reclaim the $2 mark in the coming sessions. Recovery projections place the short-term target between $2.50 and $2.70, though this would require a decisive break above long-standing resistance. Medium-term predictions remain cautiously optimistic but restrained. Many experts expect XRP to trade between $1.96 and $2.27 into the end of 2025, with stronger upside momentum unlikely until regulatory clarity and upcoming ETF activity begin shaping demand heading into 2026.

Related Reading: Ethereum Dead Cat Bounce Puts Price At $3,400, But What’s The Ultimate Target? With Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other major assets plunging sharply, traders are bracing for what could be another turbulent stretch, especially with billions in options set to expire. ETH's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Massive Liquidations Trigger Steep Sell-Off According to data from Coinglass, more than $2 billion in long and short positions were liquidated over the last 24 hours, marking one of the most severe unwinding events since October’s historic crash. Bitcoin (BTC) crashed as low as $82,000, while Ethereum (ETH) slid below $2,700. Traders holding long positions bore the brunt of the damage, with over $1.8 million in longs wiped out across major exchanges. The largest single liquidation order took place on Hyperliquid, where a massive BTC-USD position valued at $36.78 million was wiped out. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin long liquidations alone have totaled approximately $966 million, while Ethereum long positions have similarly suffered around $407 million in losses. With no details revealed on the specific tokens or exchanges involved, the incident still sent shockwaves through the community, further fueling bearish sentiment. Options Expiry and Whale Moves Add to Market Pressure The sell-off comes ahead of a crucial $4.2 billion crypto options expiry, with more than 39,000 BTC options and 185,000 ETH options set to expire. Traders have leaned heavily into put positions, signaling expectations of further downside. For Bitcoin, the max pain point sits near $98,000, well above current prices, while Ethereum’s around $3,200. Meanwhile, whale behavior has added fuel to the fire. A mega BTC whale who has held Bitcoin since 2011 reportedly sold over 11,000 BTC, worth $1.3 billion, intensifying downward pressure. However, at the same time, other large holders accumulated over $65 million in spot BTC near the $85,000 level, hinting at strategic dip-buying even as volatility spikes. Fragile Liquidity Keeps Market on Edge The market’s instability can be traced back to October’s $19.5 billion liquidation event, which severely disrupted liquidity conditions. Market makers, still recovering from the shock, remain cautious, creating a fragile environment where even minor price swings can trigger cascading liquidations. Despite the chaos, signs of resilience emerged from infrastructure players like Solana and Fireblocks, which maintained high transaction speeds and network reliability during periods of unprecedented stress.

    "title": "Anti-CZ Whale Loses Big: $61M in Profit Wiped Out As Ethereum and XRP Longs Collapse",
    "body": "Ethereum has officially broken below key support levels, and market sentiment is rapidly deteriorating as major assets across the crypto landscape continue to slide. Analysts are increasingly calling for the arrival of a new bear market, noting that both Bitcoin and the leading altcoins have lost critical technical zones that previously held the broader structure together. ETH, now trading at multi-month lows, is feeling the full weight of cascading liquidations, strong sell-side volume, and evaporating investor confidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden Deposits Final 2,499 BTC ($228M) to Kraken – Details Adding to the growing uncertainty, Lookonchain reports a striking development: in just 10 days, more than $61 million in profit has disappeared for a well-known market participant often referred to as the Anti-CZ Whale. This trader previously gained attention for aggressively opening shorts immediately after CZ purchased ASTER — a move that paid off handsomely until the recent violent downturn reversed his fortunes. The Anti-CZ Whale’s Unrealized Profit Collapse Adds Pressure According to Lookonchain, the trader known as the Anti-CZ Whale has taken a massive hit during the latest market downturn — and Ethereum sits at the center of the damage. Just 10 days ago, this whale had accumulated nearly $100 million in total profit on Hyperliquid, largely fueled by aggressive positions built during periods of high volatility. However, as the crypto market sharply corrected, his oversized ETH and XRP longs turned against him. The result has been a brutal drawdown: his total profit has now fallen to just $38.4 million, wiping out more than 60% of gains in less than two weeks. This dramatic reversal reflects more than one trader’s misfortune — it signals the extent of the pressure weighing on Ethereum. As ETH continues to decline and investor sentiment deteriorates, even the most seasoned actors are struggling to navigate the volatility. The whale’s rapid profit erosion highlights how quickly bullish conviction can shift when key support levels fail. For Ethereum, holding the current zone is crucial. Price action has already inflicted significant pain across longs, short-term holders, and leveraged players. If ETH loses this support decisively, the next wave of forced selling could deepen losses and accelerate the broader market capitulation.

The chart shows a strong rejection from the $4,500 zone earlier this quarter, followed by a sustained series of lower highs and lower lows, confirming a medium-term downtrend. The 50-week moving average has been lost decisively, and ETH is now sitting directly on top of the 100-week MA, a level that has historically acted as a key pivot during major market corrections. Volume has expanded during the recent drop, highlighting an environment driven by fear and forced selling rather than controlled profit-taking. This aligns with broader market conditions, where liquidity is thin and volatility remains elevated across majors. A clean break below $2,650 would open the door for a retest of the $2,300–$2,400 zone, which served as strong accumulation during previous cycles.

For now, Ethereum must hold above this weekly support to avoid a deeper retrace and preserve the structure needed for a potential recovery. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "$2 Billion Gone In Minutes: Bitcoin Slide Shakes Crypto World",
    "body": "According to exchange and on-chain data, global crypto markets plunged Friday as prices slid and forced a widespread sell-off. Bitcoin fell under $83,000, while Ethereum traded below $2,800. The breakdown sent roughly $2 billion of positions into liquidation, knocking confidence and prompting quick losses across major tokens. Related Reading: XRP Supply Shock Ahead? ETFs Could Consume It All, Analyst Predicts Heavy Liquidations Rock Traders Reports show more than 390,000 accounts were wiped out during the move. One single BTCUSD order on Hyperliquid stood out at $37 million, a sign of how fierce the selling became. Bitcoin bore the brunt: about $962 million of BTC positions were erased within 24 hours, with long bets making up nearly $931 million of that total. These figures underline how concentrated the damage was among those betting on higher prices. Long Positions Versus Shorts Long liquidations across the market approached $1.78 billion, while short liquidations were much smaller at close to $130 million. A rapid shift followed a strong US jobs report, which removed odds of a December rate cut and triggered roughly $450 million in liquidations in just two hours. That macro surprise appears to have fed directly into traders’ risk management systems. Options Expiry Raises Stakes Derivatives activity added pressure as more than $4.2 billion of crypto options were due to expire that day. Over 39,000 BTC options, valued near $3.4 billion, were on the docket. The longer-term put-call ratio sat at 0.52, but heavy recent put buying pushed the 24-hour ratio up to 1.36, signaling a burst of hedging. The so-called max pain level for Bitcoin was around $98,000, well above where spot trades were happening. Ether options also featured prominently, with more than 185,000 contracts worth close to $525 million set to lapse. ETH’s 24-hour put-call moved to 1.01 from 0.72, and the options market’s max pain rested near $3,200, above spot prices near $2,800. Altcoins Felt The Impact The rout spread fast. Solana dropped 11% to about $126, while XRP slid more than 8% to roughly $1.91. Other tokens that fell in the wave included ASTER, HYPE, TNSR, DOGE, and ZEC. Selling was broad, showing that the move was not limited to one market or sector. #PeckShieldAlert Following $ETH‘s drop below $2,900, a whale (0x3ee3…42a6) was liquidated on their long $wstETH position.

    "title": "Risks To Crypto Market Ahead Of Key MSCI Ruling: Will It Spark A New Bitcoin Sell-Off?",
    "body": "In what could soon be recognized as the worst-performing week since November 2022, the market’s leading crypto, Bitcoin (BTC), experienced a significant downturn on Friday, plummeting to an eight-month low of $80,000. Market analysts suggest that this downturn began in earnest on October 10, when the market first exhibited signs of a downward trajectory. That day was marked by a brutal liquidation event, erasing nearly $21 billion within minutes and triggering a series of flash crashes that have since perpetuated fears throughout the industry. Digital Asset Treasuries At Risk? Ran Neuner, the founder of Crypto Banter, believes he has uncovered the reasons behind the crash that commenced on October 10 and why the market has struggled to regain its footing since then. Related Reading: Saylor’s Strategy Under Threat: Index Status At Risk With $8 Billion On The Line According to Neuner, two primary players known as Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), including firms like Strategy (MSTR) and others, have been significant buyers driving this market cycle. The objective for these firms is straightforward: to become large enough to gain entry into major indices. Once included, passive index trackers are compelled to purchase large quantities of their stocks, thereby enabling these companies to grow even larger and secure placements in additional indices, thus perpetuating a self-reinforcing cycle. On October 10, MSCI, the world’s second-largest index company, announced a critical evaluation. They are questioning whether companies that primarily hold crypto assets should be classified as either “companies” or “funds.” If these firms are categorized as funds, they would no longer qualify for inclusion in passive indexing. This is crucial because funds follow a cyclical pattern: they acquire assets, grow larger, and become eligible for additional indices, further boosting their asset base. A ruling on this matter is anticipated on January 15, 2026. Should it favor the classification of these companies as funds, Neuner asserts that firms like Strategy could face automatic removal from all indices. Such a decision would compel pension funds and other passive index holders to divest from these companies, effectively diminishing one of their primary reasons for existence. The Future Of Crypto Hinges On Upcoming Ruling Given that DATs have underpinned the current market cycle through substantial purchasing pressure, investors apparently recognized the implications of the October 10 announcement right away and adjusted their positions accordingly. This pivotal date now appears anything but coincidental; it marked a realization among informed market participants regarding significant risks to both cryptocurrencies and the existing market structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Market Confirmed? Expert Predicts Price Target Of $40,000 By Late 2026 Looking ahead, the expert predicts that the market could continue to decline until the end of December. If the forthcoming announcement from MSCI is unfavorable, Neuner believes that a substantial sell-off may ensue as investors prepare for the potential exclusion from indices. Conversely, if the ruling is positive, Neuner asserts that it could signal a renewed bull market for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. As of this writing, Bitcoin has slightly recovered to $84,880. However, the market’s leading cryptocurrency is trading 32% below its all-time high of $126,000, which was reached at the beginning of October—just four days before the major crash.

    "title": "USDC Floods Exchanges: Are Traders Buying The Bitcoin Crash?",
    "body": "On-chain data shows a large amount of USDC inflows have just hit exchanges, a potential sign that investors are looking to buy the Bitcoin dip. USDC Exchange Inflow Has Registered Multiple Spikes Recently As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the USDC Exchange Inflow has shot up recently. The “Exchange Inflow” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of a given asset that’s being transferred to wallets connected with centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Retraces To Lower Bound—What Comes Next? Generally, investors deposit their coins to these platforms when they want to trade them away. As such, whenever the Exchange Inflow spikes, it can be a sign that there is demand for selling the asset. Such a trend can naturally be bearish for Bitcoin and other volatile cryptocurrencies. When it comes to stablecoins, however, trading has no effect on their price, as they are, by definition, stable around the fiat currency that they are pegged to. This doesn’t mean that stablecoin exchange deposits are without consequences, though. Investors usually store their capital in the form of USDC or another stablecoin when they want to avoid the volatility associated with Bitcoin and company. Once these traders feel the time is right to buy back in, they send their stables to exchanges and swap to the asset of their choice. As such, stablecoin inflows can actually be a bullish sign for the market. From the chart shared by Maartunn, it’s visible that the USDC Exchange Inflow has surged recently, a potential sign that fresh capital is looking to accumulate the volatile coins. The latest wave of USDC exchange deposits have arrived as Bitcoin and other digital assets have gone through a crash. Given this timing, it’s possible that traders are buying the dip. In some other news, the recent bearish price action has been especially hard on the short-term holders (STHs), as Glassnode analyst Chris Beamish has pointed out in an X post. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STHs have witnessed a plunge in their Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) alongside the market downturn. STHs are the investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days, and the asset is currently trading at levels notably below any seen during this window, so the entire cohort has dropped into a state of loss. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Dominated By US Selling, CryptoQuant Data Shows Since the recent downtrend has been quite steep, the degree of unrealized loss faced by the cohort has also been unlike anything witnessed since November 2022, when the last bear market reached its bottom. “STH are seriously feeling the pain,” noted Beamish. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly slipped below $81,000 earlier in the day, but it has since seen a small jump back to $83,900.

    "title": "Crypto Funds Face Third Consecutive Weekly Losses, Totaling $3 Billion In Outflows",
    "body": "Recent commentary from the Kobeissi Letter has underscored a troubling trend in the capital markets: crypto-focused funds have encountered substantial outflows, with a notable $2 billion exiting last week alone. This marks the most significant withdrawal since February and extends a concerning streak, bringing total outflows to $3.2 billion over the last three weeks. Bitcoin And Ethereum Face Massive Withdrawals Leading these outflows is the market’s leading crypto, Bitcoin (BTC), which experienced a massive $1.4 billion in withdrawals, while the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), followed closely with $689 million. As a result of these dynamics, the average daily outflows as a percentage of assets under management (AuM) have reached unprecedented levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Market Confirmed? Expert Predicts Price Target Of $40,000 By Late 2026 The cumulative impact of these outflows, coupled with declining prices, has led to a 27% reduction in total assets under management, now standing at $191 billion, a situation that the Kobeissi Letter has termed a “structural decline.” Market sentiment remains largely negative, particularly for Bitcoin, with expert Lark Davis examining current trends through the lens of key moving averages. Davis pointed out that as long as Bitcoin trades below the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), currently placed just above the $10,000 mark, it remains in a bear market. He questioned whether the current downturn signifies a “big bear,” hinting at skepticism regarding recovery prospects, or a “mini bear,” reminiscent of April’s decline where Bitcoin, despite losing the 200-day EMA, did not breach the 50-week EMA. Davis proposed three possible scenarios for the coming weeks. The first posits a drastic descent into “goblin town” without recovery, which he considers unlikely given current oversold conditions. The second scenario involves a short-term rally that tests the 50-week EMA, potentially luring investors back before a sharp downturn. The third scenario, which Davis leans towards, suggests that Bitcoin could reclaim the 50-week EMA by year-end, fueled by easing macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates and market valuations. Crypto Market Turmoil Intensifies Compounding these market concerns is the precarious situation of Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, headed by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor. Jacob King, CEO of SwanDesk, remarked that should Bitcoin fall a few more percentage points, specifically below Strategy’s average buy at just below $80,000, the firm would find itself in a precarious position with its Bitcoin holdings. King fears that forced liquidations could occur again for crypto investors, which could drive Bitcoin prices down toward $10,000 or lower due to increased selling pressure. Related Reading: Saylor’s Strategy Under Threat: Index Status At Risk With $8 Billion On The Line King’s commentary reflects a broader skepticism regarding the sustainability of the crypto market’s structure. He criticized the investment strategies surrounding Bitcoin as being propped up by “unsustainable fraud and hopium.” Highlighting past statements by Saylor, King recalled when Saylor encouraged extreme measures—such as taking out double mortgages and selling personal assets—to invest in Bitcoin, asserting that the current market turmoil should come as no surprise. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $84,700, over 30% below all-time high levels of $126,000 reached earlier in October. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Analyst Says It’s Time To Rethink Altcoins And Alt Season Expectations – Here’s Why",
    "body": "As the market bleeds red and most altcoins lose crucial levels, some have suggested that investors must reshape their expectations of the crypto market this cycle and the long-awaited “alt season.” Related Reading: BitMine’s Unrealized Losses Hit $3.7B As Ethereum (ETH) Price Struggles Below $3,000 Old Crypto Cycle Is Gone – Analyst Over the past month, the crypto market has wiped out over $1 trillion in market capitalization due to a series of large-scale liquidations and strong selling pressure since the October 10 pullback, which has sunk investors’ sentiment to its lowest levels in months. Amid this performance, the early Q4 rally buzz has faded, and most altcoins have lost the ground gained during the Q3 market breakout. Market observers have shared their outlook on how the crypto market has changed and what to expect in the future. In October, Nic Carter, crypto investor and partner at Castle Island Ventures, weighed in on the shift in retail sentiment regarding most altcoins. As reported by NewsBTC, he affirmed that the bearish sentiment means the space has matured significantly. Carter explained that crypto is “boring” now because most of the uncertainties that drove much of the historical volatility have been resolved, adding that the industry has also largely derisked as a technological substrate. The investor considers that “crypto natives no longer control the narrative, there’s more serious businesses (which don’t require tokens), there’s less chaos, the whole space has matured significantly.” In a Friday thread on X, the Altcoin Sherpa also discussed the market changes, affirming that the “old cycles” have been “dead” for a while. As he explained, the previous cycles consisted of an euphoric phase, a corrective phase, and an accumulation phase before the start of a recovery phase. He highlighted the performance of Altcoins like Solana (SOL) between 2020 and 2024, noting that “this market environment is gone.” Instead, the analyst believes that the market is in a “hyper-accelerated regime.” Altcoins In A ‘Hyper-Accelerated Regime’ Under this new regime, the market experiences short-term uptrends followed by mid-term downtrends, similar to the price action of altcoins like BONK since late 2023, Altcoin Sherpa added: We have 1-3 months of pump followed by 2-6 months of downtrend and rinse repeat. There is no more euphoria where things go berserk for an entire year. Just 1-3 months and then down. Look how many cycles BONK had in a year or 2. The analyst suggested that investors should not expect 2021 conditions for most altcoins or a traditional “Alt Season,” where most tokens experience massive gains at once. He advised to capitalize when the “good times” arrive and be aware that “price can still die in 3 months.” “Reframe your brain in how you think about alt pumps and ‘alt season’. Coins will still downtrend, just not in a slow bleed. More [of] an accelerated destruction + carnage, Altcoin Sherpa detailed.

However, Sherpa affirmed that the lack of an accumulation phase will mean that “the overall coins will NOT have as strong of pumps like they used to,” as that period is what makes the rallies strong. “We aren’t seeing anything close to that anymore,” he concluded.
