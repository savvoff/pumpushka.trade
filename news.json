    "title": "XRP Ledger May Get A Tokenized Gold Upgrade, Web3 Founder Reveals",
    "body": "Tokenized gold is getting fresh attention in the XRP community, and some voices are saying the technology is ready. According to posts from XRPL developers and industry figures, the ledger can support 24/7 access, quick transfers, and integration with automated market makers. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator Meld Gold is cited as a concrete step: reports have disclosed that Meld partnered with Ripple in June 2024 and launched gold and silver tokens in Q3 2024, with each token backed by one gram of physical metal held by trusted providers. That move put an actual product on the ledger instead of just talk. Tokenized Metals Moving Toward XRPL Advocates argue that having on-ledger tokens backed by real metal changes the use case for XRP and the XRPL. Phil Kwok, co-founder of Web3 technology company and education platform EasyA, told followers that “tokenized gold is coming to the XRPL,” and validators like Vet pointed out the technical fit. absolutely. tokenised gold is coming to the xrp ledger. and it’s going to be epic. https://t.co/wSPobxHD2W — Phil Kwok | EasyA (@kwok_phil) January 9, 2026 Vet highlighted features such as constant availability and links to DeFi tools, and raised the question of why broad adoption has not happened yet. Some future features, including lending and escrow, were mentioned as ways to make tokenized metals more useful. Market Demand And The Incentive Gap Demand already exists in other corners of crypto. Reports note Paxos and Tether manage billions of dollars’ worth of tokenized metals, showing investor interest is real. Still, execution matters. Pano Mekras of Anodos Finance told the discussion that incentives are likely the missing piece; large firms may be reluctant to launch products on the XRPL unless there are clear economic reasons to do so. Attracting high-volume projects may require active outreach and stronger on-ledger incentives. Market Reaction And Price Action Based on reports, XRP’s price moved above $2 early in January 2026 and touched around $2.41 during a broader crypto upswing. The token later settled near $2 as traders digested gains. A pullback of roughly 14% has been reported since the highs, and trading has shown both inflows from institutions and bouts of profit-taking. There is no clear proof that tokenized metals have driven these swings, however; market moves are being tracked separately from on-ledger product launches. What This Means For The XRPL If more tokenized metal products arrive, the XRPL could find new uses beyond payments. Trading and settlement for gold and silver tokens would add transaction volume and could open room for new DeFi tools built around those tokens.

    "title": "Bitcoin Price Remains Below 50-Week Moving Average — What This Means",
    "body": "The Bitcoin price has slowed down after a relatively hot start to the year, as it appears that not much has structurally changed for the market leader. A crypto analyst recently revealed that the premier cryptocurrency continues to trade beneath a critical price threshold. Why The Present Scenario Raises Caution Among Investors In a January 10 post on social media platform X, analyst Ali Martinez shared that the Bitcoin price has continued to trade underneath its 50-week Simple Moving Average (SMA). This not-so-optimistic trend, according to the crypto pundit, has been ongoing for the past nine weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maintains Mid-$90k Levels: Possible Price Targets — Analyst For context, the 50-week SMA is a long-term technical indicator that calculates, on average, the closing price of an asset — in this case, Bitcoin — over the past 50 weeks. This indicator is particularly useful in establishing points of dynamic support and resistance during differing market cycles. For example, it functions as support during bull markets and acts as resistance in bear markets. When Bitcoin trades above the 50W SMA, it is often a sign that the market is in a strong uptrend. Contrarily, when the Bitcoin price trades beneath this dynamic resistance level for an extended period, it indicates that upside momentum is weakening and that major corrections might soon ensue. Interestingly, historical data is the source of this observation. From the chart shared below, there are recurrent periods where the Bitcoin price stayed consistently below the 50W SMA. In those past cycles, these periods of prolonged deviation beneath the 50W SMA preceded major pullbacks for BTC, which often ranged between 50% to 70%. Notably, the pullbacks seen did not end Bitcoin’s long-term uptrend. Rather — as is typical of corrections — they likely served as reset phases, where excessive leverage was wiped out of the market in preparation for the next long-term continuations. As a result, concerns have been raised among Bitcoin market participants, considering the similarity of the current setup to past ones. If history were to repeat itself here, the Bitcoin price could see a pullback by at least 50%, with the price falling to levels as low as $50,000. Bitcoin Price Outlook On a more positive note, the Bitcoin price still has a chance to escape the snares of its historical woes. For this to happen, the world’s leading cryptocurrency would have to reclaim the 50-week moving average and hold above it for prolonged periods. As of press time, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $90,352, reflecting no movement in the past day.

Markets were calmer overall, with the broader crypto complex up 0.55% for the day while Bitcoin hovered above $92,000 and Ethereum traded beyond $3,100. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator Market Reaction To Regulatory Shift According to social posts from Changpeng Zhao, founder and former CEO of Binance who is also known as ‘CZ’, optimism around a possible new crypto cycle helped fuel demand. CZ linked the mood to a regulatory change, saying the Securities and Exchange Commission had removed crypto from its list of priority risks for 2026. Based on reports, that move is being read by some investors as a sign of easing scrutiny, and it appears to have lifted sentiment across tokens. I could be wrong, but Super Cycle incoming. https://t.co/6TLldEMmGA — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) January 10, 2026 Institutional Buying Adds Fuel Reports note sizable institutional flows into Bitcoin products. According to a filing, Wells Fargo bought 383 million of Bitcoin ETF shares, a figure that market watchers flagged as a large institutional stake. Morgan Stanley also filed for its own spot Bitcoin ETF last week, which many see as more proof that big financial players are stepping in. Those actions are being cited by traders as one reason risk assets like Binance Coin could see more interest. Macroeconomic Calendar Could Swing Prices A packed US data week is ahead and traders say it could affect crypto angles. On Monday, the market will watch a speech by the FOMC president. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the US Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index are due. Jobless claims come on Thursday, and a Fed balance sheet update lands on Friday. Any big surprise in those numbers can push liquidity flows and quickly change appetite for tokens. Binance Coin: Technical Levels To Watch BNB briefly reclaimed the $900 zone and was reported at $909 in some feeds as the four-hour chart showed a steady climb. Short-term resistance sits near $950, with a psychological barrier at $1,000. Related Reading: XRP Ledger May Get A Tokenized Gold Upgrade, Web3 Founder Reveals Technical indicators offered cautious support for bulls: the MACD showed a bullish crossover with the blue line above the signal line, and the histogram printed positive bars, which suggests buying pressure building. The RSI sat around 56.10, under overbought levels, implying room for more gains. Traders still point to a key support range near $850. A break below that could invite heavier selling and take prices down toward $820. The scenario of a quick pullback is real; prices that move fast up can move fast down. Market participants will be watching both the macro calendar and any fresh regulatory updates for clues. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "MEXC offers $200,000 P2P airdrop to attract new users",
    "body": "Crypto trading platform MEXC has rolled out a new promotional campaign built around its peer-to-peer marketplace, offering a $200,000 airdrop pool exclusively for users making their first-ever deposit on the platform. The limited-time event began on Jan. 4, 2026, at 11:00 UTC and will run until Jan. 31 at 16:59 UTC. Participation is restricted to accounts that have never previously deposited funds on MEXC, with eligibility tied specifically to deposits completed through the exchange’s P2P channel rather than standard trading methods. To take part, users must first register for the campaign via the dedicated event page. Only after opting in are participants able to qualify by completing their first P2P deposit and reaching a net deposited amount exceeding $100 during the event period. MEXC notes that users who fail to register before depositing will not be counted toward the promotion. Participants who meet the requirements within seven days of registration unlock a fixed 10 USDT reward. All rewards are distributed from a shared $200,000 pool and allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, meaning that late participants may miss out once the pool is fully claimed. Following the conclusion of the campaign, eligible rewards will be credited directly to users’ Spot wallets. MEXC states that distribution will take place within 14 calendar days after the event ends, with most users expected to receive their airdrops within five business days. The campaign places renewed focus on MEXC’s P2P trading service, which allows users to purchase cryptocurrencies using local currencies, flexible pricing, and a wide range of payment methods. Unlike traditional exchange trades, P2P transactions on MEXC come with zero platform fees, a feature the exchange continues to promote as competition among P2P marketplaces intensifies. Through the P2P platform, users can access major cryptocurrencies including USDT, Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, Dogecoin, and Solana. The service is designed to cater to regions where direct fiat on-ramps may be limited or where users prefer localized payment options. However, the exchange has outlined several restrictions tied to the promotion. Users who withdraw funds within 24 hours of meeting the deposit requirements will be disqualified from receiving rewards. In addition, participants who have previously received rewards from other MEXC P2P promotions are excluded from this campaign. Eligibility is limited to main accounts only. Sub-accounts cannot participate independently, and any activity associated with them will be consolidated under the primary account for the purposes of eligibility checks and reward calculations. MEXC also applies internal risk and compliance reviews before rewards are finalized. Any attempts to manipulate the event, including creating multiple accounts, providing false identity information, inflating trading data, or engaging in other forms of abnormal activity, may result in disqualification and forfeiture of rewards. The exchange added that the campaign rules may be adjusted or terminated if necessary. Users were also reminded that cryptocurrency markets remain volatile and that promotional incentives do not remove the risks associated with trading digital assets. Claim the P2P airdrop",

    "body": "Bitcoin pushed above the $92,000 level late-Sunday as a legal escalation around Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell became public. The catalyst was Powell’s decision to publicly address Department of Justice subpoenas and a criminal probe he characterized as political pressure tied to the administration’s rate preferences. In a video released Sunday evening, Powell directly addressed US President Donald Trump: “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Fed setting rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.” BREAKING: Fed Chair Powell responds after Federal prosecutors open a criminal investigation into him: “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Fed setting rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of… pic.twitter.com/y1dRdoQ1fm — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) January 12, 2026 Bitcoin Community Reacts To The News The Bitcoin and broader crypto market responded immediately with a decent push higher, while “metals [were] blasting to new highs,” as analyst Will Clemente wrote via X. Related Reading: CVDD Model Signals Bitcoin Is Not Yet Deeply Undervalued: Drawdown Lags Historical Cycles The timing matters for crypto traders: the Fed is heading into its January 28 meeting with the market increasingly primed for a pause in cuts, amplifying sensitivity to any perception that monetary policy is being pulled into partisan conflict. For Bitcoin-native observers, the episode read like a real-time stress test of institutional trust: one that flatters Bitcoin’s pitch. Clemente added via X: “This environment is literally what Bitcoin was created for. The President is coming after the Fed chair. Metals are ripping as sovereigns diversify reserves. Stocks & risk assets at record highs. Geopolitical risk rising.” Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy, put the contrast in monetary regimes front and center, arguing that Bitcoin’s “credibly neutral, predictable, transparent, and censorship resistant monetary policy looks pretty good here,” after flagging Powell’s view that the subpoenas are “pretexts” for administrative meddling in monetary policy. Related Reading: Cathie Wood: Trump May Buy Bitcoin For US Reserve Ahead Of Midterms Others used the moment to widen the indictment beyond any single personality. Bitwise advisor Jeff Park argued that “independence alone cannot be a virtue when the institution at its core is incompetent,” adding that “the age of Bitcoin is drawing nearer.” Walker, a prominent pro-Bitcoin voice, framed it as a structural problem: “The problem isn’t President Trump or Jerome Powell. The problem is a centralized cabal of unelected banker-bureaucrats set the price of money and print it out of thin air.” Notably, the bullish reflex wasn’t rooted in sympathy for Powell. Strive CEO Matt Cole wrote he had “zero sympathy” for the Fed chair and accused the central bank of “gaslight[ing] the American people” on independence, concluding: “Bitcoin is even more underpriced than we realized…” Bitcoin’s move through $92,000 puts that narrative onto a price chart, but the same political-legal feedback loop that fuels the “neutral money” thesis can also intensify volatility. “For the first time ever, Fed Chair Powell is fighting back: Over the last 12 months, Fed Chair Powell has remained silent amid President Trump’s criticisms,” The Kobeissi Letter wrote via X, adding: “Today, that changed. Trump vs Powell will result in even more volatility.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,560. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

The event comes with a headline incentive, a US$250,000 SOL token reward pool that will be distributed to participants who allocate CRO during the campaign window. The promotion is already live and runs for the full month of January, combining Crypto.com’s CRO ecosystem with Solana, one of the most active layer-1 networks in crypto right now. Instead of pushing high-volume trading, this campaign is built around steady participation, where users accumulate points over time and receive SOL rewards after the event ends. A Straightforward CRO Allocation Reward System The structure behind the campaign is intentionally simple. Users allocate CRO into Airdrop Arena, earn points while the event is active, and then receive a portion of the SOL pool based on how many points they’ve collected. Crypto.com is also rewarding early activity. The first 10,000 users who allocate CRO unlock an exclusive points boost of up to 120%, giving them a clear advantage right from the start. On top of that, users can qualify for a daily points boost of up to 120% when they purchase at least 1,500 CRO and transfer it into Airdrop Arena. Tip: The purchase task needs to be completed before allocating CRO, otherwise the daily boost may not apply. How to Participate Through the Crypto.com App Everything happens inside the Crypto.com app, making the process quick even for casual users. Airdrop Arena can be accessed through the Account section, the Earn tab, or the Supermenu. Once inside the feature, users simply allocate CRO into the event and begin earning points automatically. There’s no need for constant monitoring, no complicated strategy, and no trading requirement, which makes this campaign feel more like passive participation than active speculation. Visit Crypto.com Allocate now and start building points. Campaign Dates and Key Event Details The event runs on a fixed schedule: Event duration: 1 January 2026, 10:00 UTC to 31 January 2026, 09:59 UTC Once the event ends, Crypto.com will calculate each participant’s points total and distribute SOL accordingly. Rewards, Distribution Timeline, and Lockup Rules SOL rewards will be airdropped within 7 days after the campaign concludes. Users who activate Loot Locker will receive their rewards after the lockup period ends. If Loot Locker is not enabled, SOL will be distributed directly to the user’s Crypto Wallet. The CRO allocation itself comes with a long-term condition: allocated CRO is locked for 6 months. After the lockup ends, users can withdraw their CRO or keep it allocated in Airdrop Arena to automatically join future campaigns, which is clearly designed to encourage longer-term engagement instead of short-term participation. Solana Rewards Add Extra Appeal Choosing SOL as the reward asset is not random. Solana remains one of the most watched ecosystems in crypto, supported by ongoing developer activity, memecoin momentum, DeFi growth, and infrastructure expansion. That makes SOL a reward that users actually want to hold, not just a token they instantly dump. By linking CRO allocation with SOL incentives, Crypto.com effectively ties its platform activity to another major chain that continues to attract attention from both retail and serious market participants. Airdrop Arena Reflects a Bigger Exchange Trend This campaign also fits a bigger shift happening across exchanges. Platforms are increasingly moving away from pure volume-driven rewards and instead focusing on loyalty mechanics: time-based campaigns, allocation systems, and engagement incentives that keep users active inside the ecosystem. For CRO holders, the SOL Airdrop Arena offers a way to gain exposure to Solana without selling assets or actively trading. For Crypto.com, it strengthens retention and pushes long-term platform participation through structured lockups and recurring event access. Visit Airdop Arena Allocate now and watch your points grow.",

    "title": "Solana Price Jumps, But Network Adoption Remains Weak",
    "body": "On-chain data shows the Network Growth indicator has continued to fall for Solana recently, a sign that adoption of the asset has remained weak. Solana Network Growth Has Been Declining According to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, SOL’s recent price recovery has come despite a drop in the Network Growth. This metric measures the weekly total number of addresses that are coming online on the blockchain for the first time. A wallet comes “online” on the network when it participates in some kind of transfer activity. Thus, the wallets that the Network Growth is counting are the ones that are making their first transaction on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Drop To $69,000 If Pennant Support Breaks, Analyst Warns When the value of the Network Growth is high, it means that a large number of addresses are being created on the blockchain. Such a trend can be a sign that an influx of users is occurring. On the other hand, the indicator being low suggests that there isn’t much new address generation taking place on the network, which can be a potential indication that the chain isn’t attracting fresh investors. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Solana Network Growth over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Solana Network Growth has witnessed a drawdown recently, despite the fact that the SOL price has made some recovery since its December low. This suggests that the bullish price action has been unable to bring fresh attention to the cryptocurrency. Historically, rallies have generally needed the incoming of new investors to be sustainable, as it’s the increased trading activity that provides them with the fuel to go on. In the chart, Santiment has highlighted the case of a rally where this requirement wasn’t met. The Network Growth was initially at a significant level, but as this price surge from 2025 played out, the metric’s value plummeted. This could be a potential factor behind the rally eventually running out of momentum. In late 2024, the opposite conditions were present, as the Network Growth shot up alongside the Solana bull run, implying adoption backed the price appreciation. Considering these past cases, it’s possible that the indicator might have to reverse its trajectory if SOL’s recovery has to last. The latest downward move in the Network Growth is also not the only development SOL is dealing with right now. From the graph, it’s visible that the indicator has gone through a long-term downtrend since its high in November 2024. Related Reading: $460M Crypto Longs Squeezed As Bitcoin Slips Below $90,000 Back then, the metric had a value of 30.2 million, but today, the figure has dropped to just 7.3 million. It now remains to be seen whether the long decline in the adoption of Solana will continue or if a turnaround will appear. SOL Price Solana recovered back to $144 on Sunday, but the coin has retraced to open the week as its price is back at $139. Featured image from Dall-E, Santiment.net, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Why XRP Deserves A Place As Long-Term Wealth And Life-Saving Strategy",
    "body": "In a world where financial systems are becoming fragile, XRP stands out as the intersection of a financial infrastructure designed for instant global value transfer, speed, reliability, and global accessibility. XRP’s ability to move value instantly across borders, with minimal cost and without reliance on fragile banking systems, positions it as both a long-term wealth tool and a potential life-saving instrument. XRP should be considered as part of life-saving plans. An analyst known as Bird on X has pointed out that most people keep their money in the bank, earning around 4-6% a year, and feel comfortable with it, but they rarely factor in the impact of inflation. Over time, the purchasing power of currencies like the US dollar and the British pound has been quietly eroded to the point where your money can grow on paper while losing value in the real world. XRP’s Role In The Next Phase Of Global Payments Although savings accounts are safe, many people are actually standing still or falling massively behind without even realizing it, which is why XRP comes in as a long-term life-saving strategy. XRP has spent years held back by legal uncertainty, and during that time, the technology continued to mature. Currently, there’s clarity, and what was being built has become visible.

As the utility is increasing, capital is flowing into the ecosystem. More usage creates more demand, and sustained demand is what drives long-term value growth. According to Bird, XRP is to be trusted more than fiat, which is why it is a long-term savings vehicle rather than a short-term trade. XRP can be reserved for self-custody, stored on a cold wallet, removing reliance on banks altogether. Instead of earning a few percentages while fighting inflation, you’re holding a digital asset positioned at the centre of growing global financial infrastructure, which is more likely to increase in value over time. In comparison, it is unclear whether inflation will ever pause to make cash worth more. The analyst views this scenario as a long-term wealth investment and believes that XRP will become one of the most utilised digital assets in the world. Thus, building a savings position now could prove to be one of the smartest financial decisions someone could make over the long run. A Bridge Between Old Money And New Rails ChartNerd noted that Ripple is not built to be a traditional crypto company that aims to destroy the old money. Instead, Ripple acts as the bridge between the old and new financial worlds, and this will be a more successful long-term strategy.
