    "title": "Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Panic: 65,200 BTC Sent To Exchanges At Loss",
    "body": "On-chain data shows Bitcoin short-term holders have transferred a large amount of BTC at a loss to exchanges, a sign of another capitulation wave on the network. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Are Depositing To Exchanges At Loss As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, short-term holders (STHs) have just made another wave of underwater exchange deposits. Related Reading: XRP, Bitcoin Now In “Good Buy Zone,” Says Analytics Firm The STHs refer to the investors who purchased their Bitcoin during the past 155 days. This cohort is generally considered to include the weak hands of the market, who easily sell at the sight of market volatility. Recently, the market has been witnessing a bearish shift, which is exactly the type of event that STHs would be expected to react to. There are several ways to track the moves being made by these investors, with one such being the data of their exchange inflow transactions. Usually, the STHs transfer their coins to centralized exchanges when they are looking to sell, so a spike in exchange deposits from the group can be a sign of a selloff. During downtrends, loss selling is the most common type of distribution from the STHs due to the fact that their cost basis is at recent prices, which tend to be higher in bearish phases. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the 24-hour loss exchange inflows made by the STHs over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STHs made a large amount of loss deposits to exchanges when the cryptocurrency’s price crashed to $94,000 last week. The same appears to have followed during the latest downward move in the asset. In total, STHs have sent 65,200 underwater tokens to the exchanges over the last 24 hours. At the current exchange rate, this amount is worth a whopping $6.08 billion. This new wave of capitulation wave in the STHs came as BTC dropped toward $89,000. Interestingly, what has followed this FUD from the STHs has so far been a rebound for the asset. On-chain analytics firm Glassnode has also shared data related to the STH capitulation in a new X post. Glassnode’s chart is for the amount of loss that the STHs as a whole are realizing through their transactions across the network. The 7-day exponential moving average (EMA) value of this metric is currently sitting at $427 million, which is the highest that it has been since November 2022, when the last bear market bottomed out.

    "title": "Kraken Achieves $20 Billion Valuation With $200 Million Investment From Citadel",
    "body": "The US-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken recently secured a substantial $200 million investment from Citadel Securities, a global market maker. This investment values the exchange at an impressive $20 billion. Kraken’s Growth Backed By Citadel Securities Citadel Securities has expressed enthusiasm about supporting Kraken’s growth, emphasizing the firm’s role in shaping the future landscape of digital innovation within markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Alert: This Indicator Signals SELL, Could History Repeat With A 67% Drop? Jim Esposito, president of Citadel Securities, highlighted their commitment to collaborating with Kraken on risk management and market structure analysis, among other strategic initiatives. This capital infusion comes on the heels of a previous financing round back in September of this year, during which the digital asset platform successfully raised $600 million at a $15 billion valuation. Investors in this earlier round included Wall Street entities such as Jane Street, DRW, HSG (formerly known as Sequoia Capital China), Oppenheimer, Tribe Capital, and the family office of Arjun Sethi, who serves as the exchange’s co-CEO. IPO Plans Unhurried Despite Strong Figures Kraken’s fundraising efforts, totaling $800 million across its two recent financing rounds, have significantly strengthened the company’s financial position ahead of its planned initial public offering (IPO) in the upcoming year. Related Reading: Crypto Market Wipes Out $1 Trillion Since October: Analyzing The Forces Behind The Crash However, last week, Bitcoinist reported that Kraken has no plans to speed up its initial public offering, backed by robust financial figures. In a Yahoo Finance interview, Sethi stated, “We have enough capital on our balance sheet as a private company. We don’t race to the door as quickly as possible.” Arjun Sethi previously emphasized the importance of maintaining a prudent approach, ensuring that the company’s financial foundation remains robust and poised for sustainable growth. In the wake of the recent funding, Sethi stated: This investment represents long-term conviction in Kraken’s mission to build trusted, regulated infrastructure for the open financial system. Our focus has always been straightforward: to create a platform where anyone can trade any asset, anytime, anywhere. The exchange also disclosed substantial revenue growth in the third quarter of the year, reaching $648 million. Yet, its closest competitor, Coinbase—the largest exchange in the country—reported revenue growth of $1.9 billion. Kraken’s recent acquisitions, including its $1.5 billion purchase of the futures trading platform NinjaTrader, are further examples of the exchange’s strategic expansion efforts this year. Looking ahead, the exchange revealed in a blog post: We plan to enter new markets across Latin America, Asia Pacific and EMEA, while broadening our offerings beyond crypto to include additional asset classes, advanced trading tools and staking solutions, expanded payment services and enhanced institutional capabilities.

    "title": "Solana Reclaims $140 As Second Wave Of SOL ETFs Debut – Is A Rebound Coming?",
    "body": "Amid the second wave of crypto-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Solana (SOL)-based investment products have been leading the charge, fueled by strong demand despite the recent market volatility. As a new group of investment products based on the altcoin hits the market and SOL’s price starts to recover, some suggest that a rebound could be underway. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Worst-Case Scenario For Bitcoin (BTC) As Price Shows Concerning Signs Solana ETFs Take Over The second wave of Solana ETFs has arrived in the market after the successful launch of SOL-based investment products. On Monday, VanEck debuted its Solana ETF (VSOL) on Nasdaq, becoming the third investment product based on the altcoin to launch over the past month. According to the announcement, the firm is waiving its 0.30% fee on the first $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) or until February 17, 2026. Meanwhile, its third-party staking provider will also waive its fee for staking services under the same conditions. Adding to the momentum, Fidelity and Canary Capital launched their FSOL and SOLC ETFs on Tuesday, after recently filing 8-A forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that Fidelity is “easily the biggest asset manager in this category with BlackRock sitting out,” adding that it is “Game on” with the other launches. Meanwhile, Nate Geraci also highlighted the new launch, but expressed surprise that BlackRock is “sitting this one out” as many anticipate a successful performance. Notably, Bitwise and Grayscale debuted their BSOL and GSOL ETFs at the end of October, registering a record-breaking performance since their launch. Farside Invest data shows that SOL-based investment products have recorded over $390 million in inflows, with 15 consecutive trading days of positive net flows, signaling strong institutional demand for the products. In a Tuesday X post, Bitwise’s CEO, Hunter Horsley, noted BSOL’s positive performance despite the market correction, affirming that “prices are in the eye of the beholder.” “ETF investors continue to buy the dip. Grateful for the trust in Bitwise to steward investor assets,” he added. Institutional Demand To Fuel SOL’s Rebound? Amid the Tuesday launches, SOL’s price bounced 8.4% from its five-month low of $128, recorded on Monday. The cryptocurrency has declined 12% over the past month, losing crucial levels during the market correction. However, Bybit recently suggested that the newly launched investment products could reshape “its price trajectory and market structure for years to come.” In a recent report, the crypto exchange’s analysts noted that the altcoin joined Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as one of the few digital assets with regulated brokerage access in the US. This “represents a structural shift in how SOL is accessed, traded and perceived,” significantly expanding SOL’s investor base and confidence. “If historical patterns hold, Solana could be on the cusp of a multi-quarter rally that redefines its position in the crypto hierarchy,” the exchange affirmed. Analyst Ted Pillows pointed out SOL’s price action, calling it “one of the worst-performing large caps recently.” However, he argued that, because of this, most of its downside liquidity has already been taken out, with “decent liquidity clusters around the $170-$200 level.” Related Reading: Crypto Market Wipes Out $1 Trillion Since October: Analyzing The Forces Behind The Crash To analysts, if the market starts to recover and stabilizes, Solana could rally 20%-40% to retest this area. Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades affirmed that SOL is “putting in quite the reversal relative to its BTC pair,” as the cryptocurrency has broken out of a three-week downtrend against Bitcoin after some failed attempts. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $141, a 25.3% decline in the monthly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Is 80% Into The Bear Market, Analyst Reveals What Will Confirm It 100%",
    "body": "With the Bitcoin price struggling recently, the expectations are that the crypto market is headed into another bear run. This is characterized by Bitcoin losing $100,000 after over four months, and has not been able to reclaim this major level. Meanwhile, sell-offs among whales have continued, putting billions of dollars worth of selling pressure on the cryptocurrency. As such, the probability that Bitcoin is going into a bear market has shot up considerably during this time. Analyst Warns Of Imminent Bitcoin Bear Market Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has taken to the X (formerly Twitter) platform to share a warning with the broader crypto community. This warning was that the digital asset was more likely in a bear market compared to a bull market, giving an 80% score in favor of a bear market and only 20% in favor of a bull market. Related Reading: The ‘Insanely Bullish’ Dogecoin Setup That Will Trigger A 600% Rally To $1 This comes as there seems to be an erosion of the 4-year cycle that has characterized Bitcoin and the crypto market since its inception. The cycle expectations have deviated completely, especially as there has been no significant run for altcoins. Speaking on this cycle theory, the crypto analyst urges investors to look at the market with more nuance. This includes not following the market with blind optimism, but rather actually looking at the market for what it is and where it could be headed. The post shows the Bitcoin RSI and how it has looked before Bitcoin went into previous bear markets. Currently, there seems to be some similarity, but the crypto analyst believes that the direction will be determined next week. Titan of Crypto says that if the next week closes by November 24 looks the same, then it means that the bear market is here. Bear Market Indicators Triggered? In contrast to Titan’s stance, the Bull Market Peak Indicators tracked by the Coinglass website continue to show that the Bitcoin top is not in. This tracker consists of 30 indicators in total, showing if the Bitcoin top has been cracked in relation to historical performance, and none of them have been triggered. Related Reading: Ripple Exec Addresses Tax Issue On XRP Ledger, Where Does It Go? At the time of writing, the process bar sits just above 46% out of 100%, suggesting that it is not even halfway there to hitting the top. Thus, the indicators point toward a time to hold rather than sell, as the Bitcoin top has not been reached. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has also fallen to an Extreme Fear score of 10, which is the lowest the index has been since March 2025. Interestingly, when the index is in the red is usually when the market sees a possible reversal. However, it remains to be seen how buyers will respond to the market from here.

    "title": "Next Crypto To Explode? Solana’s $130 Bottom Puts New Alts In Play",
    "body": "What to Know: Solana’s strong defense of $130, plus a V-shaped recovery pattern, keeps a move back toward the $180–$250 range firmly on the table. Spot SOL ETFs have now attracted around $420M in cumulative inflows, signalling sustained institutional interest even after the recent correction. SUBBD Token, PEPENODE, and Aster tap AI creators, GameFi mining, and perp DEX liquidity respectively, aligning with narratives favored in risk-on phases. Solana just printed the kind of setup traders love. After a sharp 25% drawdown from $173, $SOL bounced perfectly from weekly support around $130 and is now forming a V-shaped recovery pattern, with technicians eyeing a move back into the $180–$250 range if momentum holds. On the derivatives side, futures open interest has climbed back above $7B while funding has flipped positive, showing that both spot and leveraged buyers are stepping back in. At the same time, Solana’s spot ETFs have quietly stacked 15 straight days of inflows , with US products now sitting on $420M in cumulative net inflows and more issuers lining up launches. That is textbook ‘institutional dip-buying.’ Onchain, daily active addresses on Solana are up 18% in the last 30 days , reinforcing the idea that this isn’t just a speculative dead-cat bounce but a network with real usage. If the $130 level continues to act as a base, a proper rotation back into high-beta altcoins becomes much easier to justify. In that kind of environment, the hunt for the next crypto to explode usually shifts toward narratives that rhyme with what institutions are already buying: scalable infra, real revenue, and high-conviction niches like AI, creator platforms, and DeFi perps. That’s where SUBBD Token , PEPENODE , and Aster slot into the conversation as traders look beyond SOL itself. 1. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – AI Creator Rails For ETF-Age Liquidity If Solana’s ETF flows prove anything, it’s that institutions will pay for clean, narrative-driven exposure. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) leans directly into that with an AI-powered subscription platform for creators, backed by over 2K top earners and 250M+ followers already plugged into its ecosystem. The token sits in presale at $0.056975, with more than $1.3M raised so far and staking yields set at 20% APY.The idea is simple but powerful: unify creator payments, AI content tools, exclusive access, and XP-style loyalty mechanics under one token. In a world where ad revenue is choppy, and platform fees can chew through 70% of creator income, an AI agent that automates management while keeping more upside on-chain is an easy sell. Price-wise, our SUBBD Token price prediction forecasts put potential 2026 highs for $SUBBD around $0.66 if the roadmap and onboarding of big-ticket influencers land as planned. From today’s presale level, that implies over 10x on a 2026 scenario, assuming broader market conditions don’t rug the sector. Those numbers obviously aren’t guaranteed, but they show how quickly an AI-plus-creator narrative can re-rate if ETF-era liquidity starts hunting for higher beta. For traders looking to position ahead of a potential SOL-led alt season rather than chasing it, SUBBD Token is one to watch. Front-run the tokenized content revolution. Check out the SUBBD presale now. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Mine-To-Earn Meme Energy With Fat Staking While Solana is attracting the suits, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is busy courting degen gamers.It wraps the ever-present Pepe meme around a ‘mine-to-earn’ browser game where players build virtual mining rigs, upgrade nodes and facilities, and earn not just $PEPENODE but also other meme coins like $PEPE as rewards. The presale has already crossed $2.1M raised, with the current token price around $0.0011546 and staking APYs at a chunky 595%. That combo of high yield plus GameFi upside is exactly the sort of risk-on profile that tends to catch a bid once majors like $SOL firmly reclaim trend. Our PEPENODE price prediction for 2026 forecasts highs around $0.0077 by the end of the year if the mine-to-earn economy, token burns from in-game spending, and CEX/DEX listings all come together. From today’s presale price, that translates to 567% gains. Again, that’s a modeled path, not a promise, but it shows how quickly things can move if the game actually hits and meme liquidity rotates back. For anyone betting that Solana’s bottom will drag meme beta back from the dead, PEPENODE is a high-octane candidate. Explore the PEPENODE presale today. 3. Aster ($ASTER) – Perp DEX Liquidity Play As $SOL Volatility Returns If $SOL really is grinding back toward the $180–$250 band, perp DEXs are obvious beneficiaries. Volatility plus leverage is their bread and butter. Aster ($ASTER) fits that bill as a next-gen, multi-chain perp and spot DEX, offering high leverage, hidden orders, and cross-chain trading without the usual bridging headaches.The token, $ASTER, currently trades around $1.31 with a market cap above $3.1B and deep daily volume of $1.2B, placing it firmly in large-cap DeFi territory rather than niche micro-cap land. It’s already listed on major centralized venues, with Binance handling a large chunk of liquidity via the ASTER/USDT pair, which makes it far easier for bigger players to size into positions compared with most perp-DEX tokens. On the infrastructure side, Aster has processed hundreds of billions in cumulative volume, with TVL and open interest both sizable enough to matter if leveraged trading really picks up again into a Solana-led recovery. For traders wanting a liquid, exchange-listed way to express a view on higher perp activity if $SOL volatility persists, Aster is a strong candidate. Consider adding Aster via Binance. Recap : Solana’s bounce from $130, backed by rising ETF inflows, growing open interest, and healthier onchain activity, has reopened the door to an altcoin rebound. In that context, SUBBD Token targets AI creator rails, PEPENODE leans into mine-to-earn meme gaming, and Aster offers leveraged DeFi exposure, giving different ways to position for a potential next crypto to explode rotation if $SOL’s recovery holds.

    "title": "Crypto Traders See Bullish Tailwind: Hassett Jumps In Fed Chair Odds",
    "body": "Donald Trump has pushed the Federal Reserve back into the center of the crypto macro narrative, telling reporters he “already” knows who should succeed Jerome Powell and triggering a sharp repricing in real-money prediction markets in favor of Kevin Hassett. In remarks in the Oval Office, Trump said: “I think I already know my choice,” when asked about the next Fed chair. He added that he would “love to get the guy currently in there out right now, but people are holding me back,” a clear swipe at Powell without naming him. Trump also hinted at the shape of his shortlist, saying, “We have some surprising names and we have some standard names that everybody’s talking about. And we may go the standard way. It’s nice to every once in a while go politically correct.” That was enough to move markets. On Polymarket and Kalshi, contracts on “Who will Trump nominate as Fed Chair?” quickly converged around Hassett, with odds in the mid-40s to high-40s percent range. Jim Bianco summarized the shift by writing: “He wants Bessent but will take Hassett. The rest get to take selfies in the Oval Office.” In a follow-up, he noted that “Hassett (blue) is separating himself from the pack and is on the verge of being the first person to trade over 50%,” as prediction markets pushed his contract well clear of rivals. Kalshi’s own social media account underscored the move: “BREAKING: Trump thinks he ‘already knows’ who will be next Fed Chair. 47% chance it’s Kevin Hassett.” The pseudonymous trader Byzantine General zoomed out to the timeline, pointing out that “Powell’s term ends May next year,” and sketching out a Q2 scenario with “a FED chair that listens to Trump” and “tariff dividends for plebs,” before cautioning that “you never know with Trump of course, but man, there could be something cooking.” Related Reading: Crypto Market Wipes Out $1 Trillion Since October: Analyzing The Forces Behind The Crash What Hassett Could Mean For The Crypto Market For macro-oriented crypto traders, the key is the policy signal embedded in those probabilities. Hassett is widely perceived as more dovish than Powell and more aligned with Trump’s preference for easier financial conditions. That is why trader CRG (@MacroCRG), framed the moment as the arrival of a “New hand picked super dove as Fed chair coming soon.” Macro and crypto analyst Alex Krüger went further, arguing that the Fed-chair race is the real medium-term driver for risk assets once the current FOMC noise fades. “Here’s the next macro catalyst after the FOMC. A bullish catalyst the market is paying no heed to atm. It’s hard to peer into the horizon when stressed to the marrow about the present,” he wrote, adding that “the most bullish choices would be Hassett (likely), Rieder (possibly) and Zervos (unlikely).” Related Reading: Crypto Carnage Continues — Tom Lee Exposes What’s Really Going On The reason crypto traders care is straightforward: crypto assets trade as high-beta, liquidity-sensitive risk assets. A chair seen as more willing to cut rates faster, tolerate easier financial conditions or respond aggressively to equity and growth weakness is, in market logic, a structural tailwind for the long-run liquidity environment that underpins speculative flows into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At the same time, Trump’s open pressure on Powell and his readiness to talk about replacing the Fed chair in overtly political terms reinforce another strand of the crypto thesis. The more investors worry about the politicization of US monetary policy and the erosion of central-bank independence, the more compelling the “Bitcoin as hedge against political and institutional risk” narrative becomes for a subset of allocators. For now, nothing has changed at the Fed. Powell remains in office, and all that has moved is a set of probability distributions on prediction markets. But as those distributions shift toward Kevin Hassett, crypto traders are already treating the prospective hand-off as a latent, potentially significant bullish tailwind building in the background. At press time, the total crypto market cap was at $3.11 trillion. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "New Hampshire’s Bitcoin Bond Bet Puts $140T In Play – Bitcoin Hyper Steps Up",
    "body": "What to Know: New Hampshire’s $100M Bitcoin-backed municipal bond gives $BTC a compliant route into a roughly $140T global debt market. The state’s strategic Bitcoin reserve law, allowing up to 5% of funds in Bitcoin, shows treasuries are treating crypto as long-term collateral. Bitcoin Hyper aims to provide a fast, SVM-powered Bitcoin Layer 2 so that this new collateral can move efficiently across DeFi and institutional rails. With $28M raised, audited contracts, and staking at 41%, $HYPER targets utility in Bitcoin’s evolving bond and reserve landscape. New Hampshire just did what crypto Twitter has been memeing about for years: it put Bitcoin in a suit and marched it into the bond market. The state’s Business Finance Authority has approved a first of its kind $100M municipal conduit bond backed by over-collateralized Bitcoin. The borrower posts around 160% of the bond value in $BTC as collateral, with liquidation only if coverage drops below roughly 130%. This mechanism effectively opens a path for digital assets into a global debt market worth about $140T. If more states, cities, and agencies copy the playbook, Bitcoin stops being just a macro hedge and starts behaving like high-grade collateral in traditional fixed income. New Hampshire is not acting in a vacuum either. Earlier this year, it became the first state to pass a strategic Bitcoin reserve law , letting the treasurer allocate up to 5% of public funds into Bitcoin and other mega-cap digital assets, held in tightly regulated custody. Taken together, a sovereign-style reserve plus a Bitcoin-backed bond framework is a clear signal: state-level actors are preparing to use Bitcoin as both reserve asset and working collateral. Once Bitcoin is locked into bonds, reserves, and tokenized debt rails, slow base layer transactions and high fees become a real problem. You cannot plug institutional-grade collateral into a creaky payment pipe. That is exactly where the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale slides into the conversation. Bitcoin Hyper Builds Rails For Bitcoin’s New Collateral Era If Bitcoin is going to sit behind municipal bonds and state reserves, the market will need fast, programmable infrastructure that still respects Bitcoin’s security guarantees. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is aiming to be that middle layer. The project is building a Bitcoin Layer 2 that uses a canonical bridge and Solana Virtual Machine tech to move wrapped Bitcoin on a high-throughput chain. Users deposit $BTC to a monitored L1 address, an SVM smart contract verifies the transaction, and the equivalent amount is minted on the Hyper network. Transactions are then cleared on the L2 with near instant finality and are periodically settled back to Bitcoin. On top of that settlement layer, Bitcoin Hyper plans to support dApps, DeFi, NFTs, and gaming via SVM, so the same infrastructure that moves Bitcoin collateral can also host more complex products. $HYPER: The Potential ROI of $BTC’s New Infrastructure The alignment between what New Hampshire has just kicked off and what Bitcoin Hyper is building is hard to ignore. A Bitcoin that backs bonds and sits in strategic reserves needs more than cold storage vaults; it needs a performant, audited, programmable environment so value can actually move. Bitcoin Hyper is trying to occupy that lane while $HYPER is still under a cent and a half. The presale just surpassed $28M with $HYPER priced at $0.013295, which already makes this one of the best crypto presales of 2025. Considering the project’s long-term utility, investor support, and current presale numbers, our price prediction for $HYPER puts the token at $0.08625 by the end of 2026. A solid bull market could push it to $0.253 by 2030, likely higher once the implementation process kicks off. In terms of profit, think ROIs of 548% by 2026 and 1,802% or higher by 2030. If the thesis is that Bitcoin becomes pristine collateral for a chunk of that $140T debt pile, then high-speed, secure rails that keep that collateral moving are the picks and shovels. Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as one of those rails, so read our guide on how to buy $HYPER before the presale ends; Q4 2025-Q1 2026 is the projected window for the official launch. Go to the presale page and buy your $HYPER today. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR before investing.

The on-chain analytics platform revealed that the share of XRP supply in profit has fallen to 58.5%, which is the lowest since November 2024, when the price was trading at around $0.53. Glassnode further noted that despite XRP trading 4x higher now, 41.5% of its supply (around 26.5 billion) sits in loss, which it claimed is a “sign of a top-heavy and structurally fragile market”. Macro Structure Points To A Decline To $2.03 Crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that XRP is still likely making its way down to the macro .5 fib support at $2.03. She claimed that the move is playing out perfectly as Wave 2s are corrective and that the choppiness is exactly how the market should behave. The analyst further revealed that the only invalidation of the drop to the $2.03 support is a decisive break above the macro .382 level at $2.41. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Has 2 Options Right Now, Reveals Why Investors Win Either Way CasiTrades explained that this $2.41 level remains the line in the sand and that, as long as XRP stays below it, the structure points to a final sweep of $2.03. She also raised the possibility of a drop to the “still-valid” macro target at $1.65, which is the .618 fib level. The analyst noted that Wave 2 corrections commonly reach the .618 and that the longer XRP ranges without breaking resistance, the more probable a drop to that level becomes. CasiTrades stated that a move to $1.65 would not be bearish, as it would build the kind of momentum needed for a powerful macro Wave 3 to new all-time highs (ATHs). She has predicted that XRP could rally to a new ATH of as high as $10. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.15, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

Related Reading: Crypto Carnage Continues — Tom Lee Exposes What’s Really Going On According to company disclosures, Michael Saylor’s Strategy bought an extra 8,178 BTC for $835.6 million at about $102,171 apiece during the downturn. That move has drawn fresh attention because some of those newest coins are already underwater. Strategy’s Holdings And Recent Buys Reports have disclosed that Strategy now holds 649,870 BTC, equal to roughly 3.2% of the circulating supply. The firm says it paid about $48 billion for those coins. At current prices, the holding’s market value sits near $59.38 billion, leaving an overall paper gain of 22% or about $11 billion. Strategy has acquired 8,178 BTC for ~$835.6 million at ~$102,171 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 27.8% YTD 2025. As of 11/16/2025, we hodl 649,870 $BTC acquired for ~$48.37 billion at ~$74,433 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRD $STRE $STRF $STRK https://t.co/HI1TeYOvQ9 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 17, 2025 Yet CryptoQuant’s breakdown finds that roughly 40% of Strategy’s stash is now showing unrealized losses, a result of the company’s recent buying activity pushing newer lots above today’s market price. The newest 8,178 BTC purchase is already down around 10.5%, costing the company roughly $88 million on paper in a matter of days. Reports also show Strategy made three separate buys earlier this month: smaller blocks recorded on the third and the 10th of November, bringing November’s total to 9,062 BTC for $931.1 million. At current market levels those November tokens are worth about $827 million, a drop of just over 11% since the buys. Saylor’s Portfolio Turns Red? He announced the purchase of 8,178 BTC at an average price of $102,171, about 10% above current market levels. This recent bitcoin move puts ~40% of Strategy’s 649,870 BTC holdings in the red, with only 60% still in profit. pic.twitter.com/hii0BmV95P — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 18, 2025 Short-Term Losses Amid Long-Term Gains While parts of the position sit in the red, Strategy’s longer-term position remains positive. The company’s overall profit ratio of 22% is well above the deep losses it faced from mid-2022 into early 2023, when as much as 75% of its holdings were showing losses and the portfolio was down about 33%, equal to roughly $1.32 billion in paper losses then. Early last month Strategy had a peak profit ratio near 68% with gains calculated at about $32 billion, showing how swings can be large on both sides. According to filings, Saylor treats dips as chances to add coins, and this latest buying fits that pattern. Not every market participant agrees. A Fraud? Peter Schiff, a well-known gold investor, criticized Strategy’s rising average cost, which he says—at about $74,433 per BTC—has been moving closer to the market value and could limit upside if prices fail to rebound. Schiff said on Sunday that Strategy Inc.’s focus only on Bitcoin is “a fraud.” He also challenged Michael Saylor to a live debate at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai this December. Schiff argued that the company’s recent gains mainly come from the rising Bitcoin price. He warned that if people lose confidence in Bitcoin, the company’s finances could be in trouble. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Drop Under $90K Sparks Bold Claims From Crypto Execs: ‘This Is A Generational Opportunity’ What This Means For Investors For outside observers, the takeaway is straightforward: even the biggest holders can have portions of their inventory in loss when markets fall. Strategy’s newer purchases have reduced the firm’s tidy headline returns, but they did not wipe out the overall gain. Reports suggest the company is still sitting on a sizable paper profit. Short-term results for those November buys look poor. Long-term results will depend on future price moves. Featured image from Gemini, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Traders Rush To Best Wallet Token As Circle Supercharges $USDC Across Chains",
    "body": "What to Know: Circle’s xReserve lets blockchains issue $USDC-backed stablecoins that interoperate natively with $USDC, cutting reliance on external cross-chain bridges. $USDC’s market cap has surged to around $74B in 2025, reinforcing dollar-backed stablecoins as core settlement assets for on-chain finance. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) reached $17.1M in presale with a token price of $0.025965, as the token rewards investors with governance rights, reduced transaction fees, and access to trusted presales. Best Wallet pairs a non-custodial, multi-chain, mobile-first wallet with presale access, an in-app DEX aggregator, and upcoming debit card and analytics tools. Circle just flipped the switch on xReserve, a new interoperability layer that lets blockchains mint their own $USDC-backed stablecoins and plug directly into $USDC’s liquidity. Instead of juggling wrapped assets and sketchy third-party bridges, chains can now treat $USDC as native collateral and move value using Circle’s own attestation and messaging stack. This lands at a time when $USDC is already on a tear. Recent figures show its market cap has climbed to around $74B in 2025, up more than 70% since January , as institutions rotate toward transparent, regulated stablecoins. The catch is that users don’t interact with ‘interoperability infrastructure’. They interact with wallets. Every extra chain supported by $USDC, every $USDC-backed local stablecoin, and every new bridge-free flow of dollars is only as useful as the wallet that can surface it cleanly. That’s why wallet-native tokens are suddenly back in focus. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) sits right in that slipstream. The $17.1M presale powers Best Wallet as a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet built around Fireblocks MPC security, mobile-first UX, and deep presale and DeFi integrations. With Circle making USDC the de facto reserve asset across more blockchains, traders are hunting for wallets that can actually help them navigate that growing web, and Best Wallet hits the sweet spot. Buy your $BEST today while the presale is still up. Best Wallet Turns Multi-Chain Chaos Into A Single App Best Wallet is non-custodial, no-KYC, and designed mobile-first, so you can manage thousands of assets across more than 6 major chains in one interface. Under the hood, Best Wallet uses Fireblocks MPC-CMP to secure keys while still supporting custom multi-wallet portfolios and a smoother presale flow via its ‘Upcoming Tokens’ portal. That’s a direct answer to one of the biggest frictions in the market: onboarding new users into top crypto presales and DeFi without dumping them into a maze of browser extensions, bridges, and smart contract approvals. Utility doesn’t stop at basic storage either. Best DEX, the in-wallet DEX aggregator, pulls liquidity from 330 DEXs across multiple chains, including Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain, and up to 30 cross-chain bridges. This gives you the best-rate swaps and cross-chain moves without manually hopping between platforms. Put differently: Circle is solving cross-chain dollars at the protocol layer, while $BEST is trying to solve cross-chain experience at the wallet layer. If xReserve succeeds in turning $USDC into universal collateral, the wallets that surface that liquidity cleanly stand to benefit most. If you like being early to that narrative, digging into Best Wallet Token makes sense. Secure your $BEST today, before the presale ends. $BEST Presale Ends in 9 Days, Raises $17M The market is already voting. The Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale has raised over $17.19M so far, with the token currently priced at $0.025965. That’s a roughly 15% move up from the initial presale price near $0.0225, but still firmly in ‘under a nickel’ territory for anyone averaging in. Holders can lock $BEST immediately from the presale widget, with headline yields around 76% APY at the time of writing, funded from a dedicated 8% slice of the 10B token supply reserved for staking rewards. Based on the presale’s performance and Best Wallet’s utility, our price prediction for $BEST puts it at $0.05106175 in 2026. By 2030, the token could reach $0.07 or higher, once the ecosystem takes shape. From today’s presale level, that would equate to roughly 96.6% and 169.5% upside, respectively, on paper. Circle’s xReserve, $USDC’s climb to ~$74B circulation, and the tightening regulatory net around opaque stablecoins all point in the same direction: more volume through compliant dollars, routed by smart wallets. If Best Wallet can stay ahead on UX and chain coverage while $BEST keeps powering fee discounts, staking, governance, and early presale access, the token has a clear role in that flow. You can read our guide on how to buy $BEST today if you want to join the presale before it ends. Go to the official presale page and buy your $BEST now. This isn’t financial advice.

    "title": "Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Keeps Crashing- Is $80,000 Next?",
    "body": "Bitcoin has spent the past several weeks trapped in a persistent decline, wiping hundreds of billions of dollars from its market value and reversing nearly a year’s worth of gains. The pullback has pushed the price far below its October all-time high of $126,000 and has dragged sentiment with it as traders search for answers. A detailed breakdown shared by crypto analyst Tracy Shuchart offers the clearest picture yet of why this downturn has been so aggressive. Her analysis points to a failure not driven by a single factor but by several interconnected forces that broke simultaneously and created the conditions for a cascading crash. This presents the possibility of Bitcoin extending its crash to as low as $80,000. Breakdown Of The Macro Story That Sent Bitcoin To $126,000 According to Tracy Shuchart, Bitcoin’s climb from $40,000 to $126,000 was powered based on one dominant theory: a Federal Reserve easing cycle combined with a wave of institutional participation through spot ETFs. Related Reading: 4 Bitcoin Indicators That Led To Market Rallies In The Last 2 Years Have Returned Traders priced in a supportive macro backdrop where rate cuts were all but guaranteed, liquidity would expand, and institutions would steadily absorb supply. However, once the Federal Reserve reversed course, the foundation of that theory collapsed. Expectations for December rate cuts fell from 90% to 40%. Real yields on short-term Treasuries stayed elevated above 5%, and the strong-dollar environment returned. With the macro assumption gone, Bitcoin’s valuation near all-time highs became difficult to justify. Institutions that had accumulated through Spot ETFs quickly reduced exposure, producing more than $1.1 billion in outflows within days. This wasn’t panic selling but a systematic rebalancing by portfolio managers who no longer believed the macro thesis. This change in macro expectations effectively removed the first layer of support that had been holding Bitcoin above six-figure levels. The second layer of the decline came from the behavior of long-term holders. Wallets that accumulated bitcoin between $40,000 and $80,000 began distributing aggressively once volatility returned. They offloaded roughly 815,000 Bitcoin in thirty days, locking in substantial profits. Is $80,000 Next For Bitcoin? Shuchart’s argument is based on the notion that the ongoing decline persists because the market has now reached a point where natural buyers have vanished. Institutions are rebalancing away from risk, long-term holders are waiting for deeper discounts, and retail traders have retreated. Until there’s new demand, Bitcoin’s price will continue drifting lower. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Just Flashed A Death Cross, But It’s Not What You Think “Now the market is repricing based on reality: high real yields, no Fed easing, strong dollar environment,” the analyst said. For a bottom to form, three conditions must be met. Leverage must be completely flushed out of the system, long-term holders need to stop selling and begin accumulating again, and real capital must find the price attractive enough. As it stands, Bitcoin is still trading above the $90,000 price level. However, recent price action saw it briefly slip below that threshold on November 18, touching lows near $89,000 before recovering. That move shows that the downtrend is already probing for lower support in the $80,000 zone. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $91,080.

    "title": "$4M On The Move: Libra Scandal Addresses Make A Surprising Solana Play",
    "body": "Libra-linked wallets quietly pulled roughly $4 million from a failing memecoin and used part of their stash to pile into Solana, according to on-chain tracking and news reports. Related Reading: Crypto Carnage Continues — Tom Lee Exposes What’s Really Going On The move comes amid fraud probes and renewed scrutiny of the token’s launch, which earlier this year saw large withdrawals that rocked investor confidence and drew legal attention. Wallets Rotate Funds Into Solana Based on on-chain data, two addresses tied to the Libra project — labeled “Libra Deployer (Defcy)” and “Libra Wallet (61yKS)” — bought about $61.5 million worth of SOL at an average price near $135. Before these purchases, the same addresses reportedly held roughly $57 million in USDC, enabling a quick rotation from stablecoin holdings into a major Layer-1 token. Blockchain analysts flagged the activity after tracing a string of transfers that drained the last remaining liquidity from the token’s market. The withdrawals of nearly $4 million followed earlier large cash-outs tied to the coin’s creators that investigators say removed as much as $99 million from circulation at the token’s launch. That wave of exits and the token’s sudden collapse prompted several probes in Argentina and the US. What The Purchases Mean For Markets Market watchers said the swap into SOL is notable because it moves money from a controversial, politically linked memecoin into a mainstream crypto asset. Meanwhile, the political angle has not faded. The Libra token’s launch drew attention after Argentine President Javier Milei publicly promoted the coin and then tried to distance himself as losses mounted. The broader pattern of meme tokens tied to politicians has raised fresh worries about transparency and investor protection, with some lawmakers and regulators taking a closer look. Legal And Control Questions Remain Reports have asked who finally controls the wallets now and whether authorities can freeze the new SOL holdings. Fraud investigations are active, but on-chain moves show the addresses retained control long enough to shift assets across chains.

    "title": "Dogecoin Price Could Surge Above $1 As It Repeats This Trend From 2023-2024",
    "body": "The Dogecoin price may be poised for a significant rebound, as a familiar long-term pattern has emerged on its chart. According to technical analysis, the structure looks almost identical to a setup that triggered a major breakout in its previous cycle, from 2023 to 2024. With Dogecoin currently at a crucial support level that once marked the start of its last sustained rally, a crypto analyst has projected that the meme coin could enter a new bullish phase, potentially driving it above $1. Past Pattern Foreshadows Dogecoin Price Surge To $1 Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has predicted that the Dogecoin price could soon surge to $1.10 from its current $0.15 in this cycle. In a recent X post, he highlighted that Dogecoin’s weekly chart has settled on its support trendline for the third time in the current 2021-2026 cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Cup And Handle Pattern Is Returning, What Happens To Price If It’s Completed? The chart shows DOGE’s price reaching this key level after a prolonged pullback, creating a structure similar to the one that formed in late 2023. At the time, this pattern marked the beginning of a slow but consistent uptrend that lasted throughout 2024, ultimately creating the meme coin’s mid-cycle range peak. The historical comparison between the 2023 – 2024 cycle and the current cycle is clear on the analyst’s chart. In the previous cycle, Dogecoin completed three closes at the support zone before sharply reversing upward. The latest weekly pattern mirrors the exact alignment, with price tightening around a rising trendline while forming higher lows. Trader Tardigrade also noted that the previous cycle’s slow bull run began from the same setup. Notably, the chart highlights a large boxed region representing the projected 2024 to 2025 phase, where a widening price structure suggests that Dogecoin could still have room for an upward move. If historical patterns repeat as expected, the meme coin could initiate another powerful leg up above $1 by 2026. Dogecoin’s Bullish Thesis Strengthens After Channel Break Trader Tardigrade has also highlighted an important improvement on Dogecoin’s lower-timeframe chart, indicating a shift from a downtrend. The two-hour chart setup reveals a breakout from a Descending Channel that had previously controlled price movements during the meme coin’s recent decline. The breakout is visible as the white price line pushes above the Descending Channel’s upper boundary, signaling a potential shift in short-term momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Bounce Very Quickly If This Happens At $0.166 According to Trader Tardigrade, technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) support this shift. While the RSI has broken above its resistance zone, the MACD histogram shows a buildup in positive momentum, with bars expanding upward. The analyst has explained that Dogecoin often begins its largest bull rallies with early signals on the LTF before spreading to the higher time frames. With momentum rising, Trader Tardigrade believes the DOGE price may already be initiating an uptrend. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Capitulation Deepens Around $90K Level: Classic Late-Stage Fear Structure Emerging",
    "body": "Bitcoin is trading at critical price levels as the market enters one of its most tense and uncertain stages of the year. The crypto market is showing clear signs of stress, and new data from CryptoQuant confirms that Bitcoin is now moving into one of the most severe short-term capitulation phases of this cycle. According to the latest on-chain metrics, short-term holders (STHs) are realizing losses at a scale typically seen only near major market turning points. Related Reading: XRP Supply In Profit Falls to 58.5% – Lowest Since 2024 Despite Higher Price The key indicator driving this analysis is STH-SOPR, which has plunged to deeply depressed readings around 0.97. This means STHs are selling coins at a clear loss, often driven by fear rather than strategy. Even more importantly, this metric has spent several consecutive weeks below the critical 1.0 threshold, forming what analysts refer to as a structural “capitulation band.” Historically, whenever STH-SOPR remained under 1.0 for extended periods, it signaled heavy emotional selling—typically from the most reactive and least informed market participants. These episodes have repeatedly aligned with late-stage corrections, market reversals, and shifts in long-term holder dominance. With Bitcoin now sitting at a crucial technical and psychological zone, the next phase could determine whether this becomes a deeper bear trend or a major reset before recovery. Short-Term Holders Under Extreme Stress as Capitulation Deepens According to XWIN Research on CryptoQuant, the current selloff is being amplified by the behavior of short-term holders, with the STH-MVRV ratio now sitting far below 1.0. This indicates that nearly all recent buyers are holding Bitcoin at a loss, placing short-term profitability in one of the weakest conditions in the entire dataset. Historically, these deep unrealized-loss phases are extremely rare and tend to compress selling pressure quickly, as weak hands eventually run out of coins to sell. This pattern is clearly visible in real market flows. A striking 65,200 BTC were recently sent to exchanges at a loss, showing that fear is not an abstract sentiment but is materializing in real, loss-driven capitulation. This kind of behavior aligns with classical capitulation structures: unrealized losses surge, panic selling intensifies, and eventually selling pressure becomes unsustainable. Once that happens, stronger hands begin absorbing supply quietly in the background. While this setup doesn’t guarantee an immediate rebound, the broader structure is shifting toward conditions that have historically preceded cyclical recoveries. STH losses remain at extreme levels, STH-SOPR is still below 1.0, and the pressure fueling exchange inflows is rooted in panic rather than fundamentals. Volatility is likely to persist, but the ongoing cleansing of weak hands is a process often seen near the end of major corrections — not at the start. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Dumps 2,800 BTC as Bitcoin Crashes Below $90K Testing Weekly Support as Momentum Weakens Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows the market approaching a critical turning point as price trades just above $91,000 following a sharp multi-week decline. The recent breakdown from the $110,000–$105,000 range has confirmed a loss of bullish momentum, with sellers gaining control and pushing BTC toward its next major weekly support cluster near the 50-week moving average around $88,000–$90,000. This zone has historically acted as a key pivot level, often signaling whether a corrective phase deepens or stabilizes. Volume adds important context. The past several weekly candles show rising sell-side activity, reflecting panic-driven exits rather than orderly distribution. However, this surge in volume also indicates that the market may be approaching a capitulation threshold, where forced selling begins to exhaust itself — a setup often seen before stronger hands step in.

But the loss of mid-term support levels and the sustained downward pressure highlight a market struggling to find confidence. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

Related Reading: Famous Trader Bets $27 Million That The XRP Price Will Crash This decline marks the fourth consecutive day of losses, erasing last week’s recovery and signaling a shift in sentiment as traders increasingly position for a deeper pullback. XMR's price records strong losses on the daily chart. Source: XMRUSD on Tradingview Monero (XMR)’s Selling Pressure Builds Further Fresh derivatives data reflect rising bearish conviction. According to CoinGlass, Monero’s futures Open Interest has fallen over the last 24 hours, while short positions now account for more than 55% of all trades. The drop in OI, now hovering around $78 million, suggests traders are withdrawing capital as fear of further downside builds. Technical indicators support this shift. The RSI has slipped below the midline, showing weakening momentum, while the MACD indicator has flashed a fresh sell signal. Together, these point toward deteriorating buying interest and a growing risk that XMR may not hold its current support levels. Support Threatened as Analysts Eye Breakdown Toward $350 Despite XMR maintaining an overall bullish structure on higher timeframes in recent months, the short-term outlook has flipped decisively bearish. The price is now testing key support zones, with the 50-day EMA at $348 emerging as the next major level to watch. A close below $358, which aligns with the neckline of a double-top pattern, would confirm a bearish breakdown, potentially accelerating losses toward the low-$300 region. Analysts warn that this scenario becomes more likely if market demand continues to weaken, particularly as retail traders rotate into alternative opportunities and risk sentiment remains fragile. Still, not all indicators point south. Analysts note that as long as XMR holds above $373, there remains potential for an intraday rebound toward the $400–$410 resistance range. But with the price already slipping below that threshold, bulls may face an uphill battle to reassert control. Privacy Narrative Remains Strong, but Momentum Falters Despite the near-term weakness, Monero continues to benefit from growing interest in privacy-preserving technologies. Recent upgrades, such as the Fluorine Fermi hard fork, have strengthened network security and improved resistance against surveillance-based threats. Long-term forecasts remain cautiously optimistic, with projections suggesting steady, though moderate, growth through 2030 and beyond. Related Reading: Analyst Says You’re Looking At XRP The Wrong Way, Here’s What It Actually Does For now, however, XMR remains vulnerable.

    "title": "Dogecoin Flashes Major Rebound Signal As Exchange Flows Flip, Analyst Warns",
    "body": "Dogecoin’s exchange dynamics have flipped at a key moment, with fresh on-chain data pointing to a shift in short-term market structure. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) highlighted a Glassnode chart showing that Dogecoin’s net supply on centralized exchanges has just turned positive, noting on X: “Dogecoin supply on exchanges just turned positive! This shift has marked sharp rebounds before.” Dogecoin Rebound Loading? The chart in his post, “DOGE: Exchange Net Position Change – All Exchanges,” tracks monthly exchange inflows and outflows as a histogram, alongside DOGE’s price in US dollars. Green bars indicate net inflows (more DOGE moving to exchanges than leaving), while red bars show net outflows. From mid-2024 through late 2024, the series alternates between modest red and green periods before a sustained cluster of strong green bars emerges around the fourth quarter of 2024. During that phase, net inflows rise to several billion DOGE per month. At the same time, the price line accelerated from below $0.10 to a local peak to $0.48, illustrating how heavy exchange-side activity accompanied the rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakdown Or Bottom? On-Chain Risk Hits Extreme Value Zone After that peak, the structure changes. Through early and mid-2025, the histogram becomes more mixed, with smaller positive and negative reads as price oscillates broadly between roughly $0.12 and $0.30. Heading into late 2025, however, the chart shows a pronounced sequence of red bars, with net outflows extending down toward roughly −5 to −6 billion DOGE while the price trends lower from the mid-$0.20s toward the low-$0.20s and below. The final data point, emphasized by a circular highlight on the right edge of the chart, marks a clear break in that pattern: a tall green bar crosses back above the zero line, indicating that net flows have turned positive again. At that moment, the price line sits slightly above the $0.15 mark on the vertical scale. Martinez interprets this as a “major rebound signal,” pointing to previous instances where a similar transition from persistent outflows to strong inflows coincided with sharp directional moves. DOGE On Thin Ice Below $0.16 A second chart he shared, an ATH-partitioned UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), sets out where the current DOGE supply last moved on-chain. A single, dominant bar appears around $0.07392452 and accounts for 28,260,298,271.803 DOGE, or 18.62% of the measured supply. Martinez summarizes this by stating that 27.4 billion DOGE have accumulated at roughly $0.08, calling it the “most significant support level.” Between that $0.07–$0.08 block and approximately $0.16, the URPD shows a shaded “GAP” with only small intermediate bars around levels such as $0.096, $0.125 and $0.155. Above the gap, a smaller but still notable cluster appears at about $0.162633395, containing 4,399,496,300.739 DOGE (2.9% of supply). “Below $0.16, support for Dogecoin $DOGE disappears quickly,” Martinez warns, adding that the “next real demand zone sits at $0.07.” Related Reading: One Slip And Dogecoin Could Plunge Back Into A Bear Market: Analyst A third chart, a cost-basis distribution heatmap, tracks DOGE’s price against horizontal bands representing where holders’ cost bases are concentrated. It confirms two core cohorts: a lower band between $0.0812497 and $0.08279775 with 27,397,971,652.123432 DOGE, and an upper band from $0.20103297 to $0.20486326 containing 12,156,333,652.493444 DOGE. Together with the newly positive exchange flows, these data points define a market caught between a dense realized floor around $0.08 and a substantial holder cluster near $0.20, with the latest flow reversal now in focus for traders tracking DOGE’s next move. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.158. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Adoption Will Accelerate When Economics Make It Unavoidable — Here’s How",
    "body": "The discourse around the next wave of Bitcoin adoption won’t be fueled by ideology or belief, but will be driven by pure economic advantage. As the global financial system moves toward higher costs, weaker currencies, and increasing inefficiencies, BTC is emerging as the most compelling alternative because it works more effectively. Economic Pressure Points That Will Accelerate Bitcoin Uptake In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital finance, the narrative surrounding Bitcoin’s future has often been intertwined with fervent ideological conviction. A media company, known as TFTC on X, has highlighted why BTC adoption won’t be driven by ideology, but rather by economics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Now Accepted By 4 Million Businesses, Thanks To Jack Dorsey Every merchant today is focused on handing over 2–3% of every transaction to payment processors and lives under the constant threat of chargebacks. Especially for small businesses, those costs and risks compound fast. However, BTC eliminates all of it with no processing fees, no chargebacks, just instant, final settlement straight into the merchant’s wallet. As Miles, a crypto enthusiast, consistently pointed out, the economic incentives are so overwhelmingly strong that adoption becomes inevitable. Merchants save thousands on fees, and they can pass those savings back to their customers through instant cashback rewards for using BTC. This dynamic creates a self-reinforcing flywheel effect, allowing Merchants to lower their operational costs and increase their profit margins. At the same time, consumers would get tangible rewards and better value for their money by simply using BTC. Both sides will benefit immensely, while the BTC network will grow stronger. When the underlying math is this incredibly favorable, adoption is no longer a philosophical stance, but it’s an economic certainty. The Path To Reclaiming Bullish Momentum While the economic incentives will be responsible for Bitcoin’s next rally, analyst Rekt Capital has revealed a historical demand area, marked in orange, which has played a pivotal role in dictating BTC’s next major trend. The first time price tapped this zone, it produced a sharp +20% rebound before breaking down. After this breakdown, the BTC price moved to lower levels to absorb the remaining buy-side liquidity. Related Reading: Bitcoin In Bullish Confluence: Death Cross And Key Support Signal Upside Once BTC reclaimed the orange region as support, it triggered a +37% rally to new all-time highs. On the second retest, this same support zone showed signs of strength. Currently, BTC is finding support at this same historical demand area. What would happen next will be critical in determining whether this demand area will continue to strengthen or if signs of weakening will finally emerge. Furthermore, BTC will need to break the multi-week downtrend, marked in black on the chart, to relieve fear of fading support. A rebound from this demand area that fails to break the multi-week downtrend would only result in a yield of +10% move, which suggests that the support zone may be weakening.

There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $93,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down if it settles below the $90,000 zone. Bitcoin Price Faces Hurdles Bitcoin price failed to stay in a positive zone above the $92,000 level. BTC bears remained active below $92,000 and pushed the price lower. The bears gained strength and were able to push the price below the $89,500 zone.
