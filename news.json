    "title": "Here’s The Ethereum Descending Triangle Structure That Threatens A Crash Below $2,800",
    "body": "Ethereum has been having a hard time over the last few months after hitting a brand new all-time high back in August 2025. The last quarter of the year has been especially brutal, with the cryptocurrency’s price down more than 29% in Q4 2025. Despite this abysmal performance, things have failed to turn around, with technical indicators continuing to point to further decline for the altcoin. The latest of these is the appearance of a descending triangle structure, that carried the promise of further downside. Ethereum Price Is Still Not Bullish As crypto analyst Alpha Trade Scope points out in a TradingView post, the Ethereum price chart is still showing major signs of weakness. For example, the digital asset saw its price crash below a descending trendline, and this has marked the continuation of the downtrend that began three months ago. Related Reading: XRP Supply Dwindles While ETFs Go On A Buying Spree Before 2026 The current price trend has led to the formation of a descending triangle structure, which emerged after the cryptocurrency completed an impulse move. Not only this, the trend of recording lower highs has been evidence of the increased selling pressure on the cryptocurrency. Doing this below the aforementioned descending trendline just lends credence to the fact that the downtrend is not over. There has also been a major shift in the market structure of the Ethereum price. For one, there was a Change of Character (CHoCH), which shows that the Ethereum price is no longer bullish, but is rather more bearish at this point. Resistance has also mounted at the $3,000 level over time, and the price has been trading well below this resistance for a while now. Also, the Ethereum price is caught in a tight range, trading within the Fair Value Gap (FVG) mapped out between $2,930 and $2,960. This shows the rising resistance at this level, that could serve as a rejection in the case of a recovery attempt. How Low Can The ETH Price Go? If the current bearish trend holds and the Ethereum price does get rejected, then the first target for the downside lies at $2,815. This first target serves as the first support for the cryptocurrency and the destination for an initial liquidity sweep as investors sell into the decline. However, it is not the final target. Related Reading: What Does XRP Really Do? Expert Explains What It Is Built For In the case of a further break, then $2,800 is expected to give way, leading to the second major target at $2,748. This target is more of a major demand zone and is more likely to trigger a bounce due to the mounting buying pressure at this point. “The chart presents a classic bearish continuation setup, favoring downside expansion if support breaks with confirmation,” the analyst said.

    "title": "Could Bitcoin Replay Silver’s Rally… Backward? CEO Issues Warning",
    "body": "Peter Schiff has warned that Bitcoin could suffer the opposite fate of silver after the metal posted a sudden, sharp rise. Based on reports, traders and analysts are debating whether the move in silver marks a broad shift back to real assets or a brief, crowded trade that may unwind quickly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rules The Decade: Outshines Gold And Silver, Analyst Says Silver’s Rapid Climb According to trading data, silver jumped more than 10% in a single session and rose from about $78 to $79 in roughly ninety minutes. Spot silver climbed 18% last week to close at a record $79.31 on thin post-Christmas volume and its new status as a strategic metal. Reports have disclosed that this rally is being driven by a supply deficit and Washington’s decision to classify silver as a critical mineral, not by geopolitics or hopes for US rate cuts. A TradingView chart showed a near-vertical breakout, and a monthly RSI reading reached its highest level in 45 years, a sign of extreme momentum. What is happening with silver may soon be happening with Bitcoin, only in reverse. But since markets tend to melt down faster than they melt up, the time frame for the move should be condensed. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 27, 2025 Tokenized Commodities And Market Value Tokenized versions of metal assets have also gained ground. Based on reports, these crypto-linked commodity tokens are approaching a $4 billion overall valuation, reflecting growing investor curiosity. CompaniesMarketCap data showed silver’s market value closing the gap with NVIDIA, a comparison that highlights heavy institutional demand for metal exposure. Still, tokenized assets remain small compared with spot markets and big ETFs, which means the shift is visible but not yet broad-based. Silver Vs. Bitcoin Bitcoin traded near $87,000 with little movement over the same period, according to CoinMarketCap snapshots, and some market charts show Bitcoin losing relative ground to silver since 2017. A silver-to-Bitcoin valuation model places Bitcoin’s trend value near $394,000, a figure that prompts debate among traders about where each market could go next. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF’s strong inflows in 2025 point to steady institutional accumulation in crypto, while other indicators suggest Bitcoin’s gains can stall without fresh catalysts. Spot Silver Surge Spot silver’s strong weekly gain has left technicians and strategists split. Some say the move reflects a true supply-demand mismatch reinforced by the US critical mineral designation, which has encouraged long-term buying. Others point to the thin volume after the holidays as a factor that magnified price moves. A closing price reversal top pattern at record highs has been flagged by chart watchers, signaling that a correction could follow after such rapid ascent. These signs, combined with extreme RSI readings, raise questions about the sustainability of the current breakout.

Peter Schiff argued that declines often accelerate under pressure, and that idea matters because crowded positions can be unwound in a short span. At the same time, long-term flows into Bitcoin-related ETFs and institutional products should not be ignored; they can support higher prices over time. What traders watch next will be trade volumes, whether silver holds above current levels, and whether Bitcoin regains momentum in the face of metal strength.

    "title": "Here’s Why Bitcoin Advocate Max Keiser Restates Bullish Outlook For 2025",
    "body": "Renowned Bitcoin advocate and El Salvador presidential advisor Max Keiser has once again reiterated his ultra-bullish outlook for BTC in 2025, doubling down on predictions that highlight the cryptocurrency’s role as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic instability. As the traditional financial systems face increasing pressure, Keiser maintains that BTC’s fixed supply and expanding market infrastructure position it for significant upside in the year ahead. How Macro Debt And Inflation Risks Strengthen Bitcoin’s Case According to a recent post from Crypto Miners on X, Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser has once again reiterated his long-standing BTC thesis from 2025. Keiser points to total US debt surpassing $36 trillion and annual interest expenses approaching $1 trillion, claiming that this environment could push BTC beyond $2 million as capital seeks protection from fiat debasement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom Forecast: Top Expert Predicts $40,000 Target Next Year, Here’s The Analysis The argument remains consistent with Keiser’s long-standing BTC maximalist stance, which links rising sovereign US debt expansion and currency dilution to upward pressure on a fixed supply asset. Replies are split, and supporters point to a 21 million supply against the unlimited debt. Thus, critics remain unconvinced, noting that BTC continues to trade below the $100,000 level despite similar high-conviction predictions made throughout 2025. Market commentator The Penguin updated that Bitcoin’s lower timeframe (LTF) structure is still looking a bit less impulsive, but nothing meaningful has changed in the count. Instead, BTC remains comfortable treating the current formation as a leading diagonal for wave 1, with recent LTF fluctuations resembling short-term noise rather than a decisive shift in trend. The Penguin pointed out that by setting Elliott Wave analysis aside and focusing on standard technical analysis, BTC continues to respect a well-defined range. This behavior is seen as consistent with the fact that Sunday trading and volume are light. From a trading perspective, the analyst’s focus is on longs and monitoring a possible shallow deviation toward the 0.886 retracement level marked on the chart. On the bullish side, the confirmation would be acceptance back above the $90,500 level, which would invalidate the bearish idea. Overall, the directional bias remains the same as the low-vol LTF chop is ahead of the yearly open. The Penguin added that the broader structure still looks solid and should hold up, while also noting signs of relative strength in assets such as XPL. Why Momentum Will Decide The Next Major Move Bitcoin high-timeframe (HTF) price action and momentum are currently navigating a structural pattern that mirrors a historical turning point. Crypto investor and trader known as Titan of Crypto has highlighted that BTC is showing a sequence similar to Q2 2021 and Q1 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recent Dips Reveal Market Structure Issue Not Coming From Selling Pressure While the structure price behavior remains comparable on the HTF charts, momentum indicators are showing signs of weakening. As a result, the next trend will depend on whether momentum can re-accelerate or confirm trend exhaustion. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Investment Firm CEO Drops Utility Bomb On XRP, Is Community Hype A Detriment?",
    "body": "Comments from Galaxy Digital’s leadership have looked into what ultimately sustains value in the crypto market. In a recent YouTube discussion centered on 2026 expectations for Bitcoin, crypto, and artificial intelligence, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz and Head of Research Alex Thorn singled out XRP and Cardano, questioning whether even the strongest communities can survive if real usage fails to expand when users have a vast number of alternatives to choose from. Galaxy Digital Leadership Raises Questions About Community Versus Utility During the YouTube discussion, Mike Novogratz presented the utility debate through the lens of capital allocation. He explained that the real question is what an investor chooses when presented with many viable options. If capital can flow into something like SpaceX, then crypto assets must compete on similar grounds. Related Reading: Charles Hoskinson Reveals What XRP And Cardano Are Already Doing 100x Better He acknowledged that XRP and Cardano both have deeply committed communities, but questioned whether that loyalty can be sustained if users do not see any real utility with those ecosystems. “Can Ripple hold it together? Can Cardano hold it together?” Novogratz said. In drawing comparisons, Novogratz referenced Charles Hoskinson, noting his success in maintaining Cardano’s community over time despite it being a “blockchain that people don’t really use a lot.” He made similar observations about XRP’s following, which has a strong community. However, he posed a direct question about sustainability: “Can you keep it together when there are more and more options?” Recent crypto market dynamics have caused capital flows to become more selective. Developers and teams behind blockchain ecosystems all know this, and this is why there has been a race to demonstrate usage, revenue models, or clear value flows tied directly to their tokens. According to Novogratz, that doesn’t happen overnight. It’s probably a year-long process, not a one to three-month process. Cardano And XRP Proving Real-World Relevance The questions raised during the Galaxy Digital discussion arrive at a time when both Cardano and XRP are actively trying to strengthen their utility narratives. Recent events have seen Cardano attempting to reinforce its practical relevance through initiatives like the Midnight sidechain. Midnight is a privacy-focused Cardano sidechain network designed to support confidential smart contracts and selective data disclosure. Related Reading: Flare Launches New Way For XRP Investors To Earn Midnight is intended as a way to attract enterprise and institutional use cases that require compliance-friendly privacy, an area where public blockchains have traditionally struggled. XRP, on the other hand, is taking a different path through Ripple’s hard work to increase the utility of the XRP Ledger. Ripple has been expanding utility around Ripple USD (RLUSD), its US dollar-backed stablecoin, including broader deployment across multiple Layer-2 networks. Ripple has also been on a partnership spree this year in moves to strengthen the utility of the XRP ecosystem, with about $4 billion spent on major acquisitions in 2025. The company also recently partnered with Doppler Finance to explore collaboration in XRP-based yield infrastructure and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization on the XRP Ledger, which is another added utility.

    "title": "Can XRP Price Reach $10,000? Expert Says It’s Different Math, Different League",
    "body": "A crypto expert has addressed the arguments suggesting that the XRP price could never reach $10,000. He explained that XRP is in a different league from most cryptocurrencies, making traditional valuation methods less effective. The expert also asserts that XRP is designed to handle large-scale institutional flows and, as a result, a $10,000 valuation cannot be ruled out entirely in the long run. Why The XRP Price Could Reach $10,000 Stern Drew, the founder and CEO of Stageyo, the world’s first digital marketplace for stage performers, has weighed in on the long-running debate around the future price potential of XRP. On X, the founder argued that many projections dismissing a $10,000 XRP price are flawed because they apply the wrong framework and mathematical models to the asset. Related Reading: Pundit Shares Why XRP Will Become Expensive And A $1,000 Price Tag Is Possible According to him, XRP should not be evaluated using the same assumptions as retail-driven cryptocurrencies. Drew explained that comparisons with Bitcoin and other digital assets often ignore scale entirely. He pointed out that a single Ripple partner can move more value in one day for XRP than Bitcoin processes in an entire year. This difference in settlement volume is central to how the expert believes that XRP’s future value should be gauged. The Stageyo founder further stressed that XRP was primarily designed for institutional settlement rather than speculative trading. Its core use case is tied to moving large volumes of capital across borders effectively. In that context, Drew has suggested that price expectations that rule out levels like $10,000 based on retail demand or historical crypto cycles are not relevant. He argued that low prices do not make sense when a cryptocurrency is handling massive institutional inflows. If XRP is used for high-value settlements, a higher price per token increases efficiency. This means fewer tokens will be needed to transfer the same amount of value, reducing friction and speeding up transactions. Drew described this concept as a different kind of math that applies to a “different league” of financial activity. Rather than focusing on market capitalization to gauge a cryptocurrency’s future value, the expert emphasizes liquidity and transaction throughput. From this perspective, he links the possibility of XRP reaching $10,000 to its intended role in the global financial system. XRP Positions For Major Role In Global Banking In a separate X post, Drew drew attention to a recent statement made by the Bank of Japan (BOJ). Notably, the BOJ disclosed that both Japan and South Korea are working together on developing blockchain infrastructure, subtly referencing XRP and Ripple in its announcement. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Crashes To Levels Not Seen Since 2024, Can It Also Rally 600%? Reports reveal that official discussions are currently private, but their impact is expected to be significant. The BOJ highlighted that XRP holders should watch out and brace for future developments, as this collaboration could become a transformative moment for Ripple. Notably, the crypto payments company has already established relationships with some of Japan’s largest financial institutions, including SBI Holdings. Moreover, South Korea has been a major investor in XRP over the years. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",
