    "title": "UK Crypto Ownership Takes Biggest Hit Since 2021, Regulator Says",
    "body": "According to new research commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority, the share of UK adults who hold cryptocurrencies has fallen to 8% in 2025, down from 12% a year earlier. Related Reading: Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund Survey Shows Smaller Numbers Holding Crypto Fieldwork for the FCA study ran from 5th August to 2nd September 2025, using a YouGov online panel to collect a nationally representative sample of 2,353 interviews plus a boosted sample of people who own or previously owned crypto. Awareness of cryptocurrencies remains high at 91%, even as fewer people report owning them. The drop marks the first fall in overall ownership in the last four years, although ownership is still about double the level recorded in 2021. That suggests some people who held small amounts have pulled back while a core of larger holders remains active. Average Holdings Have Increased Reports have disclosed that the mix of holdings has shifted upward. The proportion of holders with crypto worth between £1,001 and £5,000 rose to over 20%, and those with holdings of £5,001 to £10,000 increased to around 10%. At the same time, reported small holdings under £100 have declined. Many users also reported net gains in 2025, with a majority saying their portfolios rose in value over the year. Among people who still hold crypto, Bitcoin is the most common asset at 57%, followed by Ether at 43%. Other tokens are far less widely held, though Solana registers with about 21% of holders. These figures point to concentration in a few large names even as overall participation shrinks. Regulators Move To Tighten Rules The FCA published this research as part of a broader push to bring the sector under clearer rules. The regulator has launched consultations on proposals covering trading platforms, market safeguards and rules for staking, lending and custody. Reports show the consultation process is part of a wider government plan that aims to start formal regulation of cryptoassets by October 2027. What This Means For Markets And Consumers Traders and platforms will likely watch these trends closely. A smaller base of retail owners can mean less retail-driven volatility, but it can also reduce everyday familiarity with crypto in the wider public.

The FCA’s work on clearer rules comes amid growing government attention to market integrity and consumer protection. In short, fewer Britons now report owning crypto, yet those who remain tend to hold larger sums and favor the top coins. The figures from the FCA suggest a market that is thinning at the edges while concentration and regulatory scrutiny rise. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "Bitcoin has entered a critical make-or-break phase as price clings to key weekly support while momentum continues to fade. Despite holding above a major confluence zone, repeated rejections overhead suggest buyers are losing control. With macro pressure building and liquidity levels still untested, the next move from here could define whether BTC stabilizes or slides into a deeper reset. Lower-Timeframe Rejection Keeps The Downtrend In Control Crypto analyst Michael Van De Poppe revealed in a recent post that Bitcoin has faced a clear rejection at a key resistance level. This failure signals that the short-term downtrend remains intact on lower timeframes, confirming that selling pressure currently outweighs buying momentum in the immediate term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Structure Weakens As Inter-Exchange Liquidity Touches Red Zone – Details To flip this short-term bias, Van de Poppe expects a clear breakout above the $88,000 level. A successful move above this mark would serve as a strong, unequivocal signal to the markets that the corrective phase is over and that upward momentum is likely to take hold from that point forward. If buyers fail to achieve this necessary breakout, it remains highly probable that the price will pursue liquidity targets below, specifically targeting a test at $83,000 for liquidity. Should that fail, a further descent to the $80,000 level will trigger stop-losses. Finally, Van De Poppe connected the technical outlook to the broader economic environment. Given the high volume of macroeconomic events scheduled to take place over the course of the week, such as FOMC, Poppe believes that the market could experience significant volatility and end up reaching one of the predicted downside liquidity tests. $93,000 Rejection Stalls Momentum, but Weekly Structure Still Intact According to a weekly chart update by Crypto Damus, Bitcoin recently faced a firm rejection at the $93,000 resistance level. Despite that setback, price action remains constructive for now, with BTC holding above the crucial $86,000 weekly support zone. This area is reinforced with the key 100-week moving average confluence, making it an important level to watch in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Faces Potential 60% Decline As Expert Warns Of ‘Major Bull Trap’ That said, the broader structure still leaves room for deeper downside. Crypto Damus notes that a full retracement toward the rising wedge breakdown target cannot be ruled out, which aligns closely with the April low around the $78,000 region. A move into that zone would represent a more pronounced corrective phase within the larger cycle. Looking further ahead, a deeper bear-market-style retest may ultimately present a more attractive long-term opportunity. A revisit of the $70,000 level is highlighted as a potential high-conviction buying area, should the market extend its pullback. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

Bitcoin started a fresh decline below the $87,000 zone. The price is trading below $87,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $86,450 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it settles above the $87,500 zone. Bitcoin Price Consolidates Losses Bitcoin price attempted a fresh surge above $88,000 and $88,500. BTC tested the $90,000 resistance zone and reacted to the downside. There was a sharp decline below $88,000. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $86,450 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The price even spiked below the $86,000 support. However, the bulls were active near the $85,250 zone. A low was formed at $85,282 and the price recently started an upside correction. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $90,318 swing high to the $85,282 low. The bears are active near $87,000. Bitcoin is now trading below $87,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . If the bulls remain in action, the price could attempt more gains. Immediate resistance is near the $86,800 level. The first key resistance is near the $87,350 level. The next resistance could be $87,800 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $90,318 swing high to the $85,282 low. A close above the $87,800 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $88,000 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $89,200 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $90,000 and $90,500. Another Drop In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $87,800 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $85,500 level. The first major support is near the $85,250 level. The next support is now near the $85,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $84,200 support in the near term. The main support sits at $83,500, below which BTC might accelerate lower in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $85,500, followed by $85,000. Major Resistance Levels – $87,800 and $88,000.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Could Be Sub-$50,000 By 2028 Without Quantum Fix, Warns Capriole Founder",
    "body": "The founder of Capriole Investments has warned about the Quantum risk to Bitcoin, saying there’s a 34% chance it breaks BTC in the next three years. Bitcoin Could Trade At A Discount If No Quantum Fix Is Deployed As Quantum Computing continues to advance, many in the Bitcoin community have been raising concerns about what a breakthrough could mean for the cryptocurrency. Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has been one of those voices. Related Reading: Chainlink’s Top Whales Reverse Course, Quietly Scoop Up $263M In LINK Last week, Edwards gave a presentation on the Quantum threat to Bitcoin at the Global Blockchain Show in Abu Dhabi. The analyst has also shared some insights on X. According to Edwards, there’s a 34% chance that Quantum will undermine BTC’s cryptography in the next three years. Based on this, the Capriole founder has assigned a 34% discount to BTC today. “Given a 2-3 yr timeline to deploy fix, this is the current discount rate,” noted Edwards. “And it is growing. Every. Single. Day.” The probability has been estimated using seven different sources providing timelines for Quantum Computing breakthroughs. If Capriole’s calculations are to go by, the Quantum threat has a chance of more than 50% to affect blockchain technology by 2030. What will happen in the scenario that Quantum Computing does end up unlocking Bitcoin’s cryptography? Even if wallets today are secured properly, there are still old wallets that can be vulnerable. A chunk of the BTC supply has been dormant for years, and with a Quantum breakthrough, it could potentially find its way back into circulation. The most popular example of dormant holdings is, of course, the ones attributed to the cryptocurrency’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi’s wallets hold a total of 1,096,354 BTC, worth a whopping $95 billion at current prices. All these coins possibly being dumped on the market would naturally have a negative effect on the Bitcoin price. Not just because of the scale involved, but also because of the loss of confidence that such an event would result in. Considering the threat, Capriole has repeatedly stressed that a fix needs to be implemented as soon as possible. So far, the community hasn’t reached a consensus on when or what the solution should be. In an X post, Strategy co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor has also chimed in on the topic. “Quantum computing won’t break Bitcoin—it will harden it,” wrote Saylor. “The network upgrades, active coins migrate, lost coins stay frozen.” In this scenario, the coins attached to Satoshi and other early miners will forever become inaccessible. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum Plunge Triggers Near-$600 Million Crypto Long Flush Edwards has warned that if a solution isn’t implemented in time, the coin may face its biggest bear market in history. “If we haven’t deployed a fix by 2028, I expect Bitcoin will be sub $50K and continue to fall until it’s fixed,” said the Capriole founder. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $86,500, down 5.7% over the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, Capriole.com, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "According to statements reported by Russian news agencies, Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, said cryptocurrencies “will never become money” in Russia and should be treated only as investment instruments. He said that where a payment is required, it must be made in Russian rubles. Related Reading: Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund Ruble Remains Sole Payment Unit Based on reports, that stance matches existing law. A 2020 federal law on digital financial assets defines digital currency as something different from Russia’s monetary unit and bars its use as a means of payment inside the country. The law treats tokens and classic cryptocurrencies as property or investment items rather than legal tender. Russia Central Bank Concerns Over Stability Officials in Moscow have repeatedly echoed the central bank’s worry that allowing crypto for everyday payments could harm monetary control and financial stability. Regulators say the ruble’s role must be protected, and that volatility in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum makes them unsuitable for regular transactions. Limited Windows For Crypto Use Reports have also noted that while crypto cannot be used to buy goods and services domestically, it can still exist in regulated pockets. Lawmakers and regulators are framing cryptocurrencies as tradable assets, not cash. Some narrow exceptions are being discussed for corporate or cross-border operations under strict rules, but those do not change the basic ban on domestic payments. What The Law Means For People And Business Practical effects are clear. Russian residents and businesses cannot accept digital coins in place of rubles for sales or services. At the same time, individuals can hold, trade, or invest in crypto under the framework that separates ownership from payment rights. The law also requires public officials to declare holdings in digital assets, linking transparency rules to the new regime. Related Reading: 5,606 Bitcoin: Lightning Network Sets Fresh Capacity Record A Narrowing Path Forward Based on reports from several outlets, the political message is firm: payments stay in rubles. Lawmakers are talking about refining rules for trading, custody and reporting, but they are not signalling a shift toward letting cryptocurrencies replace the ruble for daily use. That position keeps Russia on a different track from some countries that permit crypto payments or give coins legal tender status. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

The price gained bearish momentum below $126. A low was formed at $121, and the price is now consolidating losses. The price recovered a few points and tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $134 swing high to the $121 low. Solana is now trading below $128 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $125 level. The next major resistance is near the $128 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $134 swing high to the $121 low. The main resistance could be $130. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $131 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. A successful close above the $132 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $140. Any more gains might send the price toward the $145 level. Another Decline In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $128 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $122 zone. The first major support is near the $120 level. A break below the $120 level might send the price toward the $112 support zone. If there is a close below the $112 support, the price could decline toward the $105 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $122 and $120. Major Resistance Levels – $128 and $131.",

    "title": "Ethereum Risks Slide To $2,000 If December Closes Below This Level: Analyst",
    "body": "A cryptocurrency analyst has explained where Ethereum could go next based on a long-term Parallel Channel forming in its monthly price chart. Ethereum Has Been Trading Inside A Parallel Channel For The Last Few Years In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a long-term pattern that Ethereum has appeared to have been following for the last few years. The pattern in question is a “Parallel Channel” from technical analysis (TA), which forms whenever an asset’s price trades between two parallel trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Be Sub-$50,000 By 2028 Without Quantum Fix, Warns Capriole Founder The upper level of a Parallel Channel is likely to facilitate top formations in the asset, while the lower one can act as a support boundary and allow the price to remain above it. Parallel Channels can be of a few different types depending on how the lines are oriented with respect to the graph axes. If the channel has some slope, it falls into either the Ascending or Descending categories. Naturally, it’s the former when the lines are angled upward and latter when they are downward. In the context of the current topic, the simplest type of Parallel Channel is of relevance: a channel that has zero slope. That is, a pattern with lines that are parallel to the time-axis. As an asset trades inside such a channel, it experiences consolidation in an exactly sideways manner. If one of the levels of the pattern break, a sustained continuation of trend may occur in that direction. This means that a surge above the resistance can be a bullish signal, while a fall under support a bearish one. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the monthly price of Ethereum has been trading inside for the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the recent bearish wave in Ethereum has meant that its 1-month price has retraced to the midway line of the Parallel Channel located at $2,930. Martinez has noted that if ETH closes December below this level, a decline to lower levels could occur. The next potential support is situated at $2,000, corresponding to the 25% mark of the Parallel Channel. The cryptocurrency found support around this line in the starting months of 2025. In the scenario that this level also fails, Ethereum may be looking at a fall to the bottom line of the Parallel Channel at $1,090. The asset last retested it back in 2022 and successfully found support.

    "title": "Optimism Grows In Crypto Market Structure Bill After Wednesday’s Senate Banking Meeting",
    "body": "On Wednesday, a bipartisan meeting of the Senate Banking Committee, led by Senator Tim Scott, offered a cautiously optimistic outlook for discussions surrounding the anticipated crypto market structure bill. Despite the absence of any markup hearings scheduled for this week, industry representatives and senators engaged in what many considered a productive dialogue regarding the evolving legislative landscape. Senators Collaborate With Industry Leaders Key figures from major crypto firms were among the attendees, including executives from Coinbase (COIN), Kraken, Chainlink, a16z, and Ripple, who have been increasingly involved in discussions aimed at fostering the positive growth of digital assets in the country. According to Eleanor Terret from Crypto In America, the atmosphere of the meeting was described as “constructive and collaborative.” Senators from both parties engaged actively with industry representatives, asking insightful questions and exploring the nuances of the proposed bill text. Related Reading: Cantor Fitzgerald Projects Major Growth For Hyperliquid (HYPE) In Explosive New Report Participating senators included Democrats Mark Warner and Catherine Cortez Masto, who were noted for their engagement and for posing significant questions to both the industry representatives and Senate Banking staff. Three key areas of ongoing negotiation emerged from the discussions: the classification of tokens—distinguishing between securities and commodities, the roles of stablecoin interest versus rewards, and discussions surrounding decentralized finance (DeFi). The meeting’s update follows earlier confirmation from a committee spokesperson that the Banking Committee will not conduct a markup hearing prior to the upcoming Christmas break. Instead, the committee intends to monitor the bill’s progress for potential action in early 2026. Intensified Talks On Crypto Regulation In a statement released earlier this week, Jeff Naft, spokesperson for Chair Scott, emphasized the committee’s commitment to pursuing a bipartisan approach to address the complexities of digital asset market legislation. “Chairman Scott and the Senate Banking Committee have made strong progress,” Naft noted, underscoring continued efforts to establish a new regulatory framework that would enhance clarity for the crypto sector and position the United States as a leader in the digital assets arena. Negotiations have intensified over the past week, with Republican members of the Banking Committee working closely with their Democratic counterparts to seek a viable compromise. Related Reading: SEC Wraps Up Investigation Into Aave Protocol, Confirms CEO Stani Kulechov However, Democrats have also consistently called for additional time in the piece of legislation to address various concerns, particularly regarding financial stability, market integrity, and ethical considerations. Specific ethics concerns have arisen related to President Donald Trump and his family’s involvement in crypto-related business ventures, which reportedly have added to their wealth. As Congress prepares to reconvene after the holiday break, immediate attention will shift to federal government funding, with the current funding bill set to expire on January 30.

    "title": "Bitwise’s 2026 Crypto Forecast: Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Poised For New Record Highs",
    "body": "In its latest report, asset manager and exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer, Bitwise, has shared an optimistic 2026 outlook for the crypto market, anticipating significant growth, while predicting new all-time highs for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Megatrends In Crypto? Bitwise begins by asserting that Bitcoin is poised to break free from its traditional four-year price cycle, setting the stage for new records. Several factors contribute to this bullish forecast. The dynamics of past cycles, including the Bitcoin Halving, interest rate fluctuations, and market booms and busts fueled by leverage, are expected to be less impactful in the coming years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom Forecast: Top Expert Predicts $40,000 Target Next Year, Here’s The Analysis Notably, the entry of large institutions like Citi, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and Merrill Lynch into the crypto space is anticipated to accelerate institutional allocations toward spot ETFs and enhance on-chain developments by 2026. As a result, Bitcoin is projected to become less volatile, even indicating that it has demonstrated lower volatility than tech giant Nvidia throughout 2025. The report also expresses strong optimism for Ethereum and Solana, particularly contingent upon the passing of the CLARITY Act. Bitwise believes that the growth of stablecoins and tokenization represents significant “megatrends,” with both Ethereum and Solana positioned to be the primary beneficiaries of this trend. ETFs To Acquire New Market Supply Institutional demand is forecasted to surge, with ETFs expected to acquire more than 100% of the new supply of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. By 2026, Bitwise expects that most institutional investors will have access to crypto ETFs. As Bitwise projects the new supply hitting the market, estimates indicate roughly 166,000 Bitcoin valued at $15.3 billion, 960,000 Ethereum around $3.0 billion, and 23 million Solana coins amounting to $3.2 billion. However, the firm anticipates that ETFs will likely purchase even more than these figures suggest. The report further highlights that crypto equities are expected to outperform traditional tech stocks. While tech shares have surged by 140% over the past three years, crypto equities have significantly outpaced them. The Bitwise Crypto Innovators 30 Index, which tracks companies providing crucial infrastructure and services for crypto assets, has rocketed by 585% during the same time frame. Bitwise believes this momentum will persist into 2026, driven by potential revenue growth, mergers and acquisitions, and a favorable regulatory landscape. Stablecoins As Scapegoats For Economic Woes As stablecoins gain traction, Bitwise cautions that they may become scapegoats for destabilizing emerging market currencies. Currently valued at nearly $300 billion, the market for stablecoins, which include tokenized versions of the US dollar like USDT and USDC, is predicted to reach $500 billion by the end of 2026. With this rise, it’s anticipated that one or two countries may blame stablecoins for their financial troubles, despite the reality that people would not turn to stablecoins if their local currencies were stable. Related Reading: Cantor Fitzgerald Projects Major Growth For Hyperliquid (HYPE) In Explosive New Report Additionally, Bitwise forecasts the launch of over 100 crypto-linked ETFs in the United States, following the SEC’s issuance of new listing standards that enable these funds to enter the market under a unified regulatory framework. This regulatory clarity sets the stage for what Bitwise dubs “ETF-palooza” in 2026. Lastly, the firm predicts that half of Ivy League endowments will likely invest in cryptocurrencies, and that on-chain vault assets under management will double in the coming years. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $86,165, having recorded major losses of 2% and almost 7% over the past 24 hours and seven days respectively. Currently, the leading crypto is trading 31.8% below its all-time high of $126,000. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Risks Double-Top Crash Toward $0.40, Peter Brandt Warns",
    "body": "Veteran chartist Peter Brandt is flagging what he calls a “potential double top” on XRP’s weekly chart, a classic reversal setup that, if confirmed, would argue for materially lower prices — even as other traders point to a washed-out weekly RSI reading that has historically aligned with prior bottom zones. Peter Brandt Flags XRP Double Top Pattern Brandt posted the chart to X on Dec. 17 and didn’t bother softening the message for XRP’s online faithful. “I know in advance that all you Riplosts $XRP will forever remind me of this post — ask me if I care,” he wrote, before adding: “This is a potential double top. Sure, it may fail, and I will deal with this if it does. But for now this has bearish implications. Love it or not — you need to deal with it.” The chart shows XRP-USDT on Binance in weekly bars, with two highs clustered around $3.40 and $3.66 and a clearly marked support shelf near $2.00. In classical chart terms, that $2 region functions as the neckline: lose it with follow-through, and the market is no longer in “pullback inside a range” territory — it’s in “failed structure” territory. Related Reading: XRP Price Falls To Critical Support Level, Is It Time To Panic? That distinction matters because double tops tend to be less about the second peak itself and more about what happens at the midpoint low between the two peaks. Brandt’s framing reflects that: the pattern is “potential” until either support holds and price reclaims prior levels, or the neckline breaks and the market accepts lower. In this case, Brandt’s chart is already showing XRP trading below the $2.00 line, with the most recent marker around $1.8859. That puts the focus squarely on whether the breakdown becomes a sustained weekly close-and-hold below support, or whether the move gets reversed quickly enough to treat it as a bear trap. Or Is The XRP Bottom In? Not everyone reading the same tape is leaning into the bearish conclusion. Trader Cryptollica posted a separate XRP/USD weekly chart (Bitstamp) on Dec. 15 highlighting the weekly RSI at roughly 33, accompanied by the comment: “$XRP WEEKLY RSI : 33 💥”. The chart highlights that, in the past five cases, similarly low readings in XRP’s weekly RSI have tended to occur around market bottoming zones. Brandt was receptive to the conditional logic — specifically, the idea that a failed double top can flip from bearish to bullish if the breakdown doesn’t stick. Responding, he wrote: “Yea, if this dbl top fails then this could become exciting. I agree. I am not championing a bear case — just showing charts for what they are.” Related Reading: Best XRP Buy Zone? Analyst Breaks Down The Key Levels That exchange captures the actual tension here. Momentum measures like RSI can identify stretched conditions and recurring historical zones, but they do not, on their own, invalidate a price-structure breakdown. Notably, Brandt did not provide a price target in his comment. But the chart he shared contains enough structure to infer the standard “textbook” projection many technicians would use. With peaks near $3.60 and a neckline near $2.00, the pattern height is about $1.60. The conventional measured move subtracts that height from the neckline after a break, implying a target in the neighborhood of $0.40 if the setup fully plays out. That is not a forecast, and it’s not a promise the market will cooperate — it’s simply the arithmetic implied by the pattern Brandt is pointing at. The more immediate question is whether XRP can reclaim the $2.00 area decisively enough to turn the breakdown into a failed move. If it can’t, the chart conversation shifts from “potential double top” to “confirmed break,” and the downside math stops being hypothetical in traders’ positioning models. At press time, XRP traded at $1.83. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Just Entered Extreme Oversold Levels And Analysts Predict New ATH Targets",
    "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) has entered an extreme oversold phase, with momentum indicators dropping to levels that historically signal market exhaustion and a trend reversal. Researchers tracking macro conditions and long-term price behavior say that the current drawdown reflects a reset in positioning, not the end of the bull market. Based on past recovery patterns, the analyst believes that Bitcoin could soon forge a path toward a new all-time high. Bitcoin Enters Extreme Oversold Territory Thomas Lee, Co-founder and Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of Fundstrat Capital, has flagged Bitcoin’s latest market condition as a key technical development. He pointed to data from Bittel Julien, head of macro research at Global Macro Investor, which highlights how deeply oversold Bitcoin has become within the current cycle and the cryptocurrency’s potential to reach a new ATH. Related Reading: Why This Week Could Be Transformational For The XRP Price In his post on X, Lee publicly commended Julien’s analysis, emphasizing that historically extreme oversold conditions in BTC have often been followed by meaningful bounces. Julien, who also shared his report on X this Wednesday, explained that his analysis responds to frequent requests for updates on a long-running market model that tracks Bitcoin’s behavior following major momentum breakdowns. According to him, the model examines BTC’s average price path after the Relative Strength Index (RSI) falls below 30, a level widely considered to indicate extreme oversold conditions. The analyst stated that Bitcoin’s recent price action has closely followed technical historical patterns, provided the broader bull market structure remains intact. The accompanying chart compares current Bitcoin price behavior with the average historical trajectory observed after the last five instances in which the cryptocurrency entered oversold territory. The point at which RSI declines below 30 is marked as “time zero.” In previous cycles, this moment typically followed a period of stabilization and a strong upward recovery over the following weeks and months. Based on historical averages, Julien sees a potential path toward new all-time highs if Bitcoin continues to track past recovery patterns. While the market researcher cautions that the chart is not perfect, he argues that it remains a useful analytical framework, particularly if the four-year cycle thesis continues to play out. BTC Cycle Could Extend Into 2026 As 4-Year Pattern Breaks Julien’s analysis also suggests that the current Bitcoin cycle could extend well into 2026 and challenge the relevance of the traditional four-year cycle thesis. According to the market researcher, the BTC cycle has never been driven by halving events, contrary to what the broader crypto community believes. Instead, he stated that the cycle is fueled by public debt refinancing, which was delayed by a year after COVID. Related Reading: Private Investment Firm Shares Why XRP Is Their Leading Investment He highlighted that Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is now officially broken due to an increase in the weighted average maturity of the debt term structure. He also noted that liquidity conditions and ongoing interest expense monetization, which far exceed GDP growth, support a prolonged cycle. Furthermore, Julien emphasized that Bitcoin’s price bases usually take time to form and often include periods of volatility before a significant upward move occurs. The market researcher explained that his analysis was not a signal of an immediate market decline but rather a framework that assumes the bull market is still firmly in place.

    "title": "Bitcoin Washout Points To $180,000 In 90 Days, GMI Says",
    "body": "Global Macro Investor (GMI) head of macro research Julien Bittel posted a bitcoin “oversold RSI” roadmap on X, arguing the market has tracked it closely and tying the setup to a broader view that the cycle could run into 2026—an outlook he says would render the traditional “four-year cycle” framework obsolete. “A lot of people have been asking for an update on this chart, so I’ll just leave this here for anyone who needs to see it,” Bittel wrote, sharing a chart of bitcoin’s average price path after RSI falls below 30, with the RSI breach marked as t=0. “This shows the average BTC trajectory following an oversold RSI reading, with RSI falling below 30 at t=0.” Can Bitcoin Skyrocket To $180,000 In Just 90 Days? Bittel said the overlay has matched the current tape. “So far, it’s been pretty bang on,” he wrote. The “average market path” line rises sharply over the weeks that follow. The chart shows a steep rally within 90 days after t=0, with the BTC price potentially surging near the $180,000 area. Related Reading: From Cycles To Continuity: Why Bitcoin’s 4-Year Pattern May Be Breaking Still, Bittel emphasized the chart is not meant to be a precision forecast. “No, it won’t be perfect,” he wrote, adding that “assuming the bull market isn’t already over, it’s a useful chart to keep in mind.” He also warned that the rebound process can be uneven: “bases can take time to form and usually come with plenty of chop before the bigger up-move kicks in.” He reiterated the conditional nature of the framework in blunt terms. “If you think the bull market is over and we are now facing twelve months of pain, this chart is not for you. Move along…” The bigger point, Bittel said, is that the familiar cycle narrative should not be taken for granted. “Unless you believe the 4-year cycle is still in play, which we don’t, this chart should hold up contextually over time,” he wrote. “As we’ve outlined many times, based on our work on the business cycle, the current path of financial conditions, and our expectations for overall liquidity, the balance of probabilities is that this cycle extends well into 2026.” In that scenario, he added, “the 4-year cycle is dead.” Bittel also challenged the common assumption that bitcoin’s rhythm is fundamentally “about the halving.” “Remember, the 4-year cycle was never about the halving, despite widespread belief that it is, but instead has always been driven by the public debt refinancing cycle,” he wrote, adding that post-COVID that dynamic “was pushed out by one year.” He now argues the cycle is “officially broken” because “the weighted average maturity of the debt term structure has increased.” He framed the macro backdrop in terms of debt-service pressure and liquidity response. “The bigger picture is that there is still a vast amount of interest expense that needs to be monetized, which has far exceeded GDP growth,” Bittel wrote. Reactions across crypto X ranged from enthusiastic to skeptical. The ₿itcoin Therapist replied: “$180,000 BTC in 90 days.” Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Death Cross’ Panic Returns: History Says It’s A Late Signal LondonCryptoClub (@LDNCryptoClub) said the chart “lines up with our thinking,” tying the narrative to what it called the Fed’s “not QE QE” dynamics and “liquidity games” between the Treasury and the central bank. The account still anticipated turbulence into year-end—“noise and chop into year end (which is negative liquidity)”—before “these fundamental drivers start to see BTC reconnect with the bull trend,” adding that “sentiment appears sufficiently bad for a BTC move higher to be the most hated trade to start 2026!” Others struck a more sardonic tone. “precision-grade hopium here,” wrote doug funnie (@cryptoklotz), while still sketching a conditional path forward: Still think as long as BTC survives (ie doesn’t close in the $70k’s and starts grinding down or accepting there), there’s a plausible path to new highs on the earlier side in 2026. Just need to survive the ‘transition zone’ of 4 year deterministic selloors exhausting, and then ending up in an awkward spot as the music keeps playing.” Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards was more critical of the statistical grounding, urging a broader test set: “Now re run this with 100 occurrences, not 5 during up only.” For traders, Bittel’s post effectively combines a tactical signal with a regime call: the RSI sub-30 template may map the rebound path, but only “assuming the bull market isn’t already over,” and only in a world where, as he put it, “the balance of probabilities” favors a cycle that “extends well into 2026.” At press time, BTC traded at $87,330.

    "title": "Why Is Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Down Today? BlackRock Deposits Spark Worry",
    "body": "The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are down today as the crypto market remains in a phase of extreme fear. This latest crash came amid BlackRock’s move, which sparked fear of a sell-off from the world’s largest asset manager. The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are down today following BlackRock’s transfer of 2,257 BTC and 74,973 ETH to Coinbase, indicating plans to offload these coins. Notably, the BTC and ETH ETFs recorded outflows on December 16, likely why the asset manager moved these coins to redeem shares for its IBIT and ETHA ETFs, which were sold that day. Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Decline Amid BlackRock’s Transfer These Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have continued to record mixed flows, which have partly contributed to declines in BTC and ETH prices. Notably, the Bitcoin price had surged to around $90,000 yesterday from an intraday low of around $87,000, before retracing below $87,000 about an hour later. This immediately sparked theories of manipulation, with some crypto pundits revealing that BlackRock wasn’t the only one selling. Related Reading: The Bearish Structure That Puts Bitcoin Price At $92,550, And Then $82,000 Crypto pundit Kruse claimed that Binance first bought nonstop for over 30 minutes to pump the price, then started dumping millions of BTC and ETH to liquidate longs. He noted that the Bitcoin price pumped about $3,300 in 30 minutes, with $106 million in shorts wiped out during that period. Following that, BTC printed another volatile hourly candle to the downside, which flushed out $52 million in longs. A similar price action had also played out for the Ethereum price. Kruse declared that this wasn’t random volatility but rather liquidity hunting. The pundit further warned that this is how leverage gets punished in crypto. He then reiterated that the volatile Bitcoin and Ethereum price actions weren’t random, indicating the market is being manipulated. Onchain Sleuth Tracer also accused Binance of being responsible for the Bitcoin and Ethereum price declines. He claimed that the crypto exchange pumped and dumped millions of BTC to liquidate traders, with $194 million in shorts and longs liquidated in one hour. BTC And ETH To Hit New All-Time Highs Next Year? Crypto asset manager Bitwise has predicted that the Bitcoin price will break the four-year cycle and set new all-time highs in 2026. The asset manager alluded to factors such as the Bitcoin halving and interest rate cycles as what will drive this rally for the flagship crypto. The firm also remarked that crypto booms and busts fueled by leverage are weaker than in past cycles. Related Reading: Ethereum 2-Year Trend Maps Out This Unique Crash Path To Bottom At $2,187 Bitwise also stated that institutions are likely to allocate more to Bitcoin ETFs, which is why they expect the Bitcoin price to reach new all-time highs next year. Furthermore, the firm noted that the pro-crypto regulatory shift will continue to allow companies to adopt crypto at a faster rate. The crypto asset manager also predicted that the Ethereum price could reach a new all-time high if the CLARITY Act passes. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "BNB has slipped below its long-standing bullish trendline, raising fresh concerns about a deeper pullback. However, the selloff is unfolding right into a key support zone, where multiple technical signals hint that buyers may be preparing for a counter-move. With breakdown risk clashing against early rebound signs, BNB now sits at a pivotal moment that could define the next major move. Bullish Trendline Break Signals A Change In BNB Market Character According to crypto analyst Marcus Corvinus, BNB has just experienced a significant structural shift by losing its long-held bullish trendline. This technical break is a critical development that is rapidly changing the market mood from optimism to caution, as a primary support trendline has been invalidated. Related Reading: BNB Rebound Underway? Price Caught Within A Head And Shoulders Pattern The analyst noted that while the price had been respecting this upward trend for a considerable period, this decisive break indicates that buyers are finally losing control. Momentum is visibly cooling off, providing sellers with the necessary opening to press and take command of the short-term price action. Corvinus warned that if the price fails to reclaim the broken trendline, the path will likely open for a much deeper move to the downside. He emphasized that this current behavior appears to be a fundamental shift in market structure rather than just a typical small pullback, suggesting a more prolonged period of weakness. Thus, the market has now entered a caution zone, with the analyst noting that bears are knocking on the door of lower support levels. The next major reaction from the market will be the deciding factor in whether BNB can recover its uptrend or embark on a new, sustained bearish trajectory. Confluence Emerges At Key Support Zone In a recent update shared on X, analyst Batman revealed that BNB is currently carving out a highly attractive long setup. The asset is exhibiting a rare alignment of multiple technical indicators, suggesting that the current price level may serve as a powerful launchpad for the next leg up. Related Reading: Binance Coin (BNB) Extends Pullback as Meme-Coin Rug Pulls Sting BNB Chain This setup is rooted in a confluence of support levels. Specifically, BNB is resting within a strong bullish Fair Value Gap (FVG). This high-interest zone has seen a positive reaction from the market, as the price tapped the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. To further bolster the bullish conviction, the momentum oscillators have aligned with the price action. Batman pointed out that the Stochastic indicator has officially formed a bullish divergence followed by a golden cross. Significantly, this combination signals that selling exhaustion has been reached and that buyers may be regaining control, thereby paving the way for a potential sustained price recovery.

    "title": "Ripple Goes Institutional: What The Doppler Finance And SBI Partnership Means For XRP",
    "body": "Ripple’s push to advance XRP’s institutional relevance took a concrete step forward following a post published by Doppler Finance confirming its partnership with SBI Ripple Asia. The announcement marks a strategic shift from retail-driven narratives to regulated, institution-ready financial infrastructure on the XRP Ledger. The collaboration positions XRP as part of a framework centered on yield generation, compliant custody, and real-world financial integration. Doppler Finance And SBI Ripple Asia To Expand XRP’s Role Beyond Payments The partnership between Doppler Finance and SBI Ripple Asia represents a major evolution in XRP’s role in finance. While XRP has long been valued for fast, low-cost cross-border payments, it has lacked infrastructure for institutional investors to earn a regulated yield. This collaboration aims to change that by developing XRP-based yield products designed specifically for compliance-conscious institutions, creating a pathway for professional investors to use XRP as a productive financial asset. Related Reading: Dogecoin RSI Hits Levels That Have Triggered ATH Rallies Before Unlike experimental DeFi initiatives, this effort prioritizes regulated access, risk management, and compliance. SBI Ripple Asia—a joint venture between SBI Holdings and Ripple—anchors the project within an established financial ecosystem, lending credibility and operational rigor. Notably, this is the first time SBI Ripple Asia has partnered with an XRP Ledger-native protocol, signaling that the focus is on building durable, scalable financial infrastructure rather than marketing hype. Custody and security are central to making these yield products viable for institutional participants. SBI Digital Markets will provide segregated custody for all assets, meeting the strict standards required by asset managers, corporate treasuries, and funds. For traders and institutional users, this means they can access XRP-based yield opportunities without assuming self-custody responsibilities or exposure to smart-contract risks typical in retail DeFi. The framework transforms XRP from a token primarily used for payments into a balance-sheet-compatible asset that can generate regulated returns, opening new avenues for institutional adoption, portfolio diversification, and professional-grade risk management. Strategic Implications For XRP And Ripple In The Broader Market The partnership strengthens XRP’s role in real-world asset tokenization. Doppler Finance and SBI Ripple Asia plan to leverage the XRP Ledger to support regulated financial products tied to tangible value, positioning XRPL as infrastructure for institutional-grade applications beyond digital payments. This approach lays the groundwork for a structured rollout of XRP-based solutions. Related Reading: Why This Week Could Be Transformational For The XRP Price Formalized as a memorandum of understanding, the collaboration signals phased implementation rather than immediate launches. While timelines and yield structures remain undisclosed, the framework reflects clear strategic intent, creating conditions for XRP to expand its role in institutional finance. For XRP, the impact is structural. Combining yield generation, compliant custody, and real-world asset integration broadens its utility in capital markets and reinforces Ripple’s institutional narrative in Asia, where regulatory clarity typically precedes retail adoption. Ultimately, the Doppler Finance–SBI partnership redefines XRP’s value proposition. The asset moves from a transaction medium to becoming an integral part of institutional financial architecture. If executed as intended, XRP’s role in global finance could shift from speed-focused transactions to long-term, durable adoption. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "XRP Enters Historical Window That Has Previously Led To Triple-Digit Rallies",
    "body": "XRP’s weekly chart has entered a technical zone that has repeatedly acted as a turning point in recent years. A recent analysis shared on the social media platform X highlights a recurring relationship between XRP’s price behavior and its 50-week simple moving average, a long-term trend indicator closely watched by traders. Instead of focusing on XRP’s short-term volatility, which has been bearish, the analysis zeroes in on how extended periods below this moving average have coincided with the end of downside phases and the beginning of rally expansions. The 50-Week SMA And Why It Matters For XRP Cycles Technical analysis of XRP’s price action on the weekly candlestick chart, which was posted on the social media platform X by Steph, reveals a repeating cycle around the 50-week simple moving average (SMA). Related Reading: Here’s What To Expect With The XRP Price Trading Under $2 This analysis is interesting because the 50-week simple moving average functions as a structural divider between bearish compression and bullish continuation on higher timeframes. In XRP’s case, previous cycles show that brief dips below this level have not been as significant as sustained stretches beneath it. The XRP price chart below tracks how long XRP stayed below the 50-week SMA before a change in momentum. In the first instance in 2017, XRP spent roughly 10 weekly candles, equivalent to about 70 days, under the moving average before staging a sharp upside move. A similar pattern appeared in the 2021 cycle, where the duration was shorter, with 49 days, but still acted as an inflection point on the weekly chart. However, the most aggressive move highlighted on the chart came in the 2024 period, where XRP traded below the 50-week SMA for about 84 days before posting a much larger rebound of about +850%. XRP Sitting Inside The Same Window Once Again According to the analysis, XRP is currently approaching about seventy days below the 50-week SMA, placing it squarely within the same historical window observed in prior cycles. Particularly, Steph noted that XRP has now spent roughly 70 days below the 50-week SMA again, and this places an outlook on what to look for in the next price action. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts How Low The XRP Price Will Go Before Bouncing Resulting price action in the past has seen XRP rallying anywhere from 70% in 2021 to 850% in 2024. If XRP resolves to the upside again from the current structure, history suggests the initial signal would be a decisive weekly reclaim of the 50-week SMA, followed by continuation rather than an immediate rejection.

Related Reading: 5,606 Bitcoin: Lightning Network Sets Fresh Capacity Record According to a post on X by user UnknowDLT, XRP’s place in global payment rails was “planned more than a decade ago,” and the token could one day become “the most valuable asset in the world,” a claim that has stirred both debate and disbelief. Community Voice Turns Loud Supporters in the XRP community have long argued that market prices miss bigger shifts. Based on reports from prominent community accounts, followers say short-term trading noise hides structural moves that could lift demand for XRP over many years. One commentator, X Finance Bull, has suggested that Ripple’s escrow — which holds 34.4 billion XRP — will act as locked liquidity for banking corridors and institutional use, not as stockpiled supply destined for retail dumps. The world is NOT ready for what is coming for XRP. It was planned more than a decade ago, it is going to be the most valuable asset in the world. There will be war for your XRP.

Reports have disclosed that the company received conditional clearance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to pursue a national trust bank charter, and that it is seeking a Federal Reserve master account.

Tokenization And Big Numbers Analysts and company projections are being used to sketch wider potential. Ripple has suggested the tokenization market could grow to $19 trillion by 2033. Other commentators take that figure and run scenarios: if a slice of that activity used the XRP Ledger, price forecasts can balloon — with one cited bullish figure at $189 per XRP under high-adoption cases. Some community voices expect large-scale tokenization momentum to build between 2026 and 2027, which they say would favor high-throughput ledgers like XRP’s.

Several firms mentioned by community members put much lower targets on XRP, with conservative models forecasting prices under $30 by 2030. Other professional models place $100 XRP well beyond the next decade. Traders and investors are left to weigh three competing threads: legal clarity, technical capacity, and whether escrowed holdings will be used for institutional flows rather than sold.

    "title": "Fading ETF Interest Puts Pressure on Dogecoin as Price Approaches Critical Cost-Basis Zone",
    "body": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is approaching a sensitive phase as weakening investor demand, stalled ETF inflows, and growing sell-side pressure converge near a key price area. Related Reading: XRP Risks Double-Top Crash Toward $0.40, Peter Brandt Warns Once driven largely by retail enthusiasm, the meme coin is now trading closer to levels where a significant share of holders last acquired their tokens, raising questions about downside risk if confidence continues to erode. At the same time, isolated whale accumulation and long-term cost-basis data suggest the market is approaching a zone that could define the next major move. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Dogecoin ETF Inflows Stall as Sentiment Softens One of the clearest shifts in Dogecoin’s recent market structure has been the loss of momentum in its exchange-traded funds. Data shows that the Grayscale and Bitwise DOGE ETFs have not recorded any inflows since December 11, with total inflows since launch standing at roughly $2 million. Combined assets under management are around $5.2 million, representing a negligible fraction of Dogecoin’s overall market capitalization. The muted response contrasts sharply with other altcoin ETFs, particularly XRP and Solana products, which have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in inflows. The lack of sustained interest has raised questions about the long-term viability of DOGE-focused funds, especially given their low revenue potential at current asset levels. More broadly, the ETF slowdown reflects a risk-averse environment, with the crypto Fear and Greed Index remaining in fear territory. On-Chain and Derivatives Data Point to Bearish Bias Beyond ETFs, on-chain metrics show declining participation from large holders. Wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE have reduced their balances by over 1 billion tokens since early December. Similarly, the proportion of DOGE supply in profit has slipped to near 50%, suggesting fewer holders are sitting on unrealized gains. Derivatives markets reinforce this cautious outlook. Short positions now account for more than half of open DOGE derivatives, while over $5 million in long positions were liquidated in a 24-hour period. Open interest has also declined, pointing to reduced speculative appetite rather than aggressive dip-buying. Price Near Key Support as $0.10 Comes Into Focus Technically, Dogecoin is trading near the $0.123–$0.126 range, an area that has repeatedly acted as support since April. The price remains below key moving averages, with momentum indicators such as MACD and RSI signaling continued downside pressure. A decisive break lower could expose the psychological $0.10 level. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Slide To $2,000 If December Closes Below This Level: Analyst Analysts have also projected deeper historical support near $0.074, where roughly 28 billion DOGE last changed hands. While a move to that level would require further deterioration in sentiment, current conditions suggest Dogecoin is approaching a cost-basis zone that could determine whether sellers remain in control or longer-term holders begin to step in.
