Solana is now trading above $135 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $135 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near $138. The next major resistance is near the $140 level. The main resistance could be $145. A successful close above the $145 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $150. Any more gains might send the price toward the $155 level. Another Decline In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $185 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $134 zone and the trend line. The first major support is near the $130 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent upward move from the $123 swing low to the $138 high. A break below the $130 level might send the price toward the $128 support zone. If there is a close below the $128 support, the price could decline toward the $120 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $135 and $130. Major Resistance Levels – $138 and $140.",

    "body": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) has ridden a fresh wave of speculative buying this week, with the token jumping nearly 20% while the broader meme coin sector surged. Related Reading: $18 Million Ethereum Loss Sends Whale Running To Gold According to Santiment, total meme coin valuation rose by about 23% over the period as traders piled back into higher-risk tokens. Trading volumes jumped from $2.16 billion to roughly $8.6 billion, a whopping increase that shows how fast money rotated into this corner of the market. Supply Concentration Raises Eyebrows Reports have disclosed that supply remains highly concentrated among a handful of wallets. The top 10 holders control over 60% of SHIB’s maximum supply, which equals around 1 quadrillion tokens. 🐶📈 Meme coins, the most “speculative” of assets, have proceeded with their post-holiday run. The entire meme market cap is now above $45.3B, growing by +20.8% in just the past week. 📊 Notable 7-day gainers include: 🪙 $PEPE +54% 🪙 $USELESS +54% 🪙 $MOG +38% 🪙 $DOG +36% 🪙… pic.twitter.com/htdfiXLaLf — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 4, 2026 Those wallets together hold about 630 trillion SHIB. Based on Santiment’s figures, the official burn wallet alone holds roughly 40% of the total supply, a stake valued at over $3 billion. This kind of concentration can magnify price swings if large holders move coins onto exchanges or sell. Technical Setup Points To A Test Analyst Charting Guy flagged the token’s weekly chart as “looking good” in a January 4 tweet, noting a strong weekly candle that closed up 22%. Based on reports, SHIB started 2026 at $0.000006904 and has since pushed higher. $SHIB weekly looks good pic.twitter.com/YigTTQ3kEW — Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) January 4, 2026 The meme coin briefly traded above $0.0000093 before a pullback and is currently around $0.000008766. Year-to-date gains sit near 32% and the token was up 5.14% over the past 24 hours and 17.31% over the last week. Charting Guy’s chart shows SHIB approaching the tip of a long-running descending trendline that traces back to a high of $0.0000334 in December 2024. A break above that line would raise the chance of a larger move higher. Meme Coins See Wide Gains Other tokens have also posted big moves. Dogecoin recorded about a 20% rise while Pepe surged roughly 65% over the same span. The group’s sharp gains came as speculative interest accelerated and traders chased short-term returns. Related Reading: A Maduro Bet, A Market Alarm: US Lawmaker Targets Trading Abuses Market Volume And Trader Behavior Santiment’s data highlights that trading activity spiked dramatically, signaling a swift return of hot money to meme coins. The jump from $2.17 billion to $8.7 billion in daily traded value shows more participants are active and willing to take bigger risks. Based on the mix of heavy supply concentration and a crowded technical setup, Shiba Inu’s path could widen in either direction. A decisive breakout above the descending trendline might extend last week’s rally, while heavy selling from large wallets could trigger sharp pullbacks.

    "title": "XRP Is Setting Up For Its ‘Next Explosive Move,’ Analysts Say: Here’s The Target",
    "body": "XRP is approaching a decision point across the monthly and daily charts, with renowned crypto analysts The Great Mattsby (Matt Hughes) and Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) framing the current structure as a volatility-compression setup that could resolve higher if key high-timeframe supports continue to hold. XRP Price Poised For ‘Explosive Move’ Mattsby’s core claim is that XRP has defended its long-term trend support and is now coiling for expansion. “XRP had a perfect bounce off the 20-month MA, while the upper and lower bands continue to contract—setting up for its next explosive move higher,” he wrote, adding: “It’s crazy how many people are bearish right at major high-time-frame support.” On the monthly chart, XRP is shown trading around $2.08629, sitting above the Bollinger basis near 1.89623, with the upper band labeled at $3.57705 and the lower band at $0.21541. The visual takeaway is the squeeze: the band envelope has tightened materially compared with prior periods, a condition Mattsby ties to “explosive” directional follow-through when it resolves. Related Reading: Jake Claver Doubles Down On $100 XRP Target After 2025 Miss The other important input on that panel is the 20-month moving average, which Mattsby highlights as the pivot. His October framing leans on historical rhyme: “XRP is repeating what it did back in 2017. Consolidate sideways for months until it touched the 20month MA. After that, it shot up to finish off the cycle.” In his view, the touch-and-hold dynamic is already in place this cycle, even if it’s “taking a little longer.” With the October 10 liquidation event, XRP pierced the 20-month moving average and has since consolidated above it. If that read holds, the most explicit upside reference on-chart is the monthly Bollinger upper band around $3.57705, a level that would represent a return to the top of the current volatility envelope rather than an open-ended projection. Wyckoff-Style Re-Accumulation Points To $8 Charting Guy’s daily chart overlays a Wyckoff-style roadmap and labels the sequence as a re-accumulation that transitions into markup. The yellow projection assumes XRP is still working through overhead supply, with the ~$2.08 area (marked by the blue horizontal line and aligned with the current print) acting as the immediate gatekeeper. In that framing, $2.08 is not a comfort-zone support level yet; it is a level XRP needs to reclaim decisively and then stay above on retests for the bullish sequence to keep validating. Related Reading: XRP Faces Strong Social Discontent—Is A 50% Bullish Reversal Just Around The Corner? A second constraint on the chart is the descending channel, the “creek” structure that defined the current downtrend. Charting Guy expects that XRP will rally towards the upper trendline resistance, followed by a controlled pullback labeled “test,” where price checks whether demand is real and whether sellers can still force acceptance back into the old range. If that test holds (another short-lived dip below $2.08 is fine), the roadmap then looks for an “LPS” (last point of support): a higher low that signals supply is being absorbed. Only after that does the yellow path call for “JATC” (jump across the creek), the clean breakout through the channel, followed by “SOS” (sign of strength) into the next major horizontal ceiling around ~$3.40. From there, the schematic expects another pause and “LPS” beneath that ~$3.40 zone, before the final markup leg accelerates into the ~$8 region. In short, the chart’s bullish outcome is conditional on sequential level-flips: first $2.08, then the channel, then ~$3.40 and finally $8. Until now, XRP is “following perfectly” the path, as the analyst noted via X. At press time, XRP traded at $2.13. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin Price On The Brink Of A 9,000% Rally To $10? What Historical Performance Shows",
    "body": "Dogecoin has spent a large part of the current cycle moving sideways, leaving its long-term chart largely defined by a downtrend. However, a technical study of Dogecoin’s previous market cycles, where similar stretches of compression preceded outsized price expansions, points to instances where Dogecoin can rally to price targets anywhere between $10 and $20 in the current cycle. How Dogecoin Performed During Previous Alt-Seasons A recent technical analysis shared by crypto analyst Javon Marks on the social media platform X looks at direct comparisons between Dogecoin’s current structure and the setups that led to its most dramatic rallies in the past. Related Reading: Dogecoin Long-Term Bullish Structure Still In Play And Will Cross $10 Looking back at previous market cycles, Dogecoin went through some of the biggest magnitudes of rallies, even within the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. During its first major alt-season run, Dogecoin surged by more than 9,000% from its base to reach a new peak of $0.015 in early 2018. Back then, this rally caught many doubters off guard, considering the fact that Dogecoin had no inherent value at the time and was the first mover in a niche of meme coins. What followed in the next cycle was even more extreme, with the second major expansion delivering gains of about 28,000% in 2021. This rally was enough to establish Dogecoin’s reputation as the king of meme coins, and the all-time high of $0.73 it reached back then is yet to be broken. The chart that followed Marks’ analysis shows that each rally began after prolonged periods where Dogecoin appeared largely stagnant and was trading sideways. What A 9,000% Or 20,000% Move Means For DOGE Applying those percentage gains to Dogecoin’s current price range produces eye-catching figures that propose a break above the anticipated $1 level and even above double digits. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Rally To All-Time Highs If It Breaks This Resistance Level A move similar to the first major alt-season rally, roughly 9,000%, would place Dogecoin around the $10 price level. A repeat of the second cycle’s performance would push the price far higher. to as high as $20. These are ultra-bullish targets that seem unrealistic based on Dogecoin’s current price levels. However, the analyst also highlighted near-term reference zones that sit well below the most extreme projections but still reflect meaningful upside. Price levels around $0.6533 and $1.25111 were identified as more realistic milestones within a bullish scenario. Interestingly, these are also very bullish, as they represent increases of 340% and 740%, respectively, from Dogecoin’s price range around $0.15. Not everyone reading the chart arrives at the same conclusion, and that difference in interpretation was evident in comments under Marks’ post. Another Dogecoin analyst, KrissPax, responded by saying there’s a difference between a full alt-season and what he described as a relief rally. According to KrissPax, nothing in the current chart suggests a $20 Dogecoin this year. However, Marks explained that the idea is not that Dogecoin will certainly reach $10 or $20 this year, but to show what types of gains to expect if another alt-season unfolds, which is looking more and more likely.

    "body": "On Monday, Bitcoin successfully reclaimed the $93,000 mark, spurred by a wave of renewed optimism that has also revitalized altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL), all of which are experiencing recoveries not seen in nearly a month. According to data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin has recorded a weekly surge of 7%, while Ethereum and Solana have outperformed the leading cryptocurrency with increases of nearly 9% during the same period. Notably, XRP has taken the lead, boasting a significant 15% uptrend. Large Holders Drive Bitcoin Surge A key driver behind this recent surge, especially for Bitcoin, can be attributed to large holders, or “whales,” who have acquired approximately 270,000 BTC in the last 30 days, amounting to roughly $23 billion. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On The Brink Of A 9,000% Rally To $10? What Historical Performance Shows Market analyst NoLimit highlighted this crucial development in a recent social media post, noting its significance: this accumulation represents 1.3% of Bitcoin’s total supply and marks the largest net buy from this group in 13 years. However, NoLimit asserts that this doesn’t imply that Bitcoin will see an immediate surge in its value. It indicates that long-term investors are aggressively positioning themselves even while the broader market sentiment remains mixed. Will BTC Establish A Macro Lower High? In the short term, though, market analyst Rekt Capital warns that despite Bitcoin hovering just above $93,400, it has closed its 12-month candle below the $93,500 mark. This suggests that the $93,500 level is likely to act as resistance moving forward. Historical patterns across four-year cycles indicate that such resistances can hinder price movement for an extended period, often resisting for up to three years before being breached in the next Halving year. Related Reading: Venezuela, Geopolitical Risk, And Bitcoin: What On-Chain Data Really Shows Should Bitcoin indeed be in the early stages of a bear market, this could imply that prices might surpass the $93,500 resistance in the coming months only to establish a macro lower high before continuing their downward trajectory. According to Rekt Capital, the sustainable breakout above this resistance is more likely to occur in the next halving year in 2028. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Consumer use of crypto-linked payment cards continued to gain traction heading into 2026, following a sharp rise in spending volumes reported by Visa for 2025. Data from Dune Analytics shows that spending across Visa-backed crypto cards increased steadily throughout last year, a significant growth. Related Reading: XRP Is Setting Up For Its ‘Next Explosive Move,’ Analysts Say: Here’s The Target Across six Visa-partnered crypto card programs, total net spending rose from $14.6 million in January 2025 to $91.3 million by December. The increase represents a 525% jump over the year and reflects growing consumer comfort with paying directly from crypto wallets at traditional points of sale. The cards are issued by a mix of crypto payment platforms and decentralized finance projects, including EtherFi, Cypher, GnosisPay, Avici Money, Exa App, and Moonwell. ETH's price trends slightly to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview EtherFi and Cypher Lead Visa Crypto Card Spending Among the tracked programs, EtherFi recorded the highest spending volume, accounting for $55.4 million in transactions during 2025. That figure placed it well ahead of Cypher, which ranked second with $20.5 million in total spend. The remaining card issuers posted smaller but consistent increases, suggesting broader participation across the ecosystem rather than growth driven by a single outlier. Monthly spending data shows a gradual rise throughout the year, with no major spikes or sharp reversals. Analysts say this pattern points to routine usage rather than one-off events. Commenting on the data, Polygon researcher Alex Obchakevich noted that crypto card spending increasingly reflects regular financial behavior, indicating that crypto-linked cards are moving beyond experimental use cases. Visa Expands Stablecoin Infrastructure Visa’s growing role in crypto payments has been supported by its expanding stablecoin infrastructure. The payments firm now enables stablecoin settlement across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Stellar. This setup allows card issuers to convert crypto balances to fiat in real time during transactions, while still relying on Visa’s global merchant network. In December 2025, Visa also launched a stablecoin advisory team focused on helping banks, merchants, and fintech companies design and manage stablecoin-based products. The initiative highlights Visa’s view that blockchain-based settlement and programmable money are becoming more relevant to mainstream payments. Outlook for Crypto Card Usage in 2026 With spending volumes rising and infrastructure continuing to expand, crypto card usage is expected to grow further in 2026. While volumes remain concentrated in the U.S., Europe, and parts of the Asia-Pacific region, the steady increase suggests consumer crypto spending is becoming more normalized.

    "title": "Analyst Updates XRP Price Prediction: Why $16 Is Still On The Table",
    "body": "A crypto analyst who previously predicted that the XRP price could rise toward $16 has now updated his outlook to a higher target. According to the revised projection, XRP is preparing to rally above $18, a level that would represent a staggering 369% surge from its current all-time high of about $3.84 Updated XRP Price Forecast Eyes Breakout Above $16 Crypto market analyst ChartNerd has updated his XRP price outlook from a previous analysis, reinforcing his bullish stance while outlining two potential market scenarios. He described the structure in his chart analysis as a Staircase to Valhalla, implying that XRP could move through distinct phases toward a higher valuation above $18, rather than experiencing a single explosive surge. Related Reading: Pi Cycle Top Put XRP Price At $300, But Is This Feasible? In his post on X, the expert stated that XRP is reacting positively from a key Vertical Accumulation Support zone that has acted as a defense barrier for roughly 13 months around $1.99. He emphasized that this area successfully held price and is now serving as the base layer for a potential continuation higher. According to the analyst’s chart, Scenario 1, which shows XRP already moving above the Vertical Accumulation Support area, remains the more bullish outcome and currently has the advantage. However, he cautions that confirmation will only come if XRP can break above the Vertical Accumulation Resistance zone between $3.1 and $3.7. If this happens, a stronger price rally can be validated. Notably, ChartNerd outlines a final “Markup” phase with a bullish target of $18-$22 for XRP. This projection reflects a steep expansion zone shown on the chart following a successful breakout from the Vertical Accumulation Resistance and a subsequent consolidation period. ChartNerd also outlines a second scenario, which presents a more bearish path for XRP. In this case, the cryptocurrency could dip below $1.5 from its current price above $2 before attempting to approach the vertical accumulation resistance again. In the near term, he agreed that XRP is currently at support and suggested that a break above $2.20 could open the door to further upside. Analyst Says 2026 Will Be A Landmark Year For XRP In a recent post, ChartNerd shared a chart highlighting a historical structure that closely mirrors XRP’s price behavior in 2016. During that period, XRP was quietly building momentum that eventually fueled its bullish surge in January 2018. Related Reading: XRP Price Mirrors 2017 Sideways Accumulation Trend – Here’s What Happened Last Time ChartNerd has suggested that if history repeats itself, 2026 could become a landmark year for XRP, potentially setting new records and marking a major milestone for the cryptocurrency. The analyst described the 2026 pattern as an uncannily similar formation, featuring the same Double Top formation and wick drop seen in the 2016 structure. Additionally, both timelines experienced a Stochastic Relative Strength Index (SRSI) reset, reinforcing the expert’s thesis that XRP could replicate its 2016 bullish trend in 2026.

    "title": "Bitcoin’s Recovery Extends Into 2026 as Charts Hint at Another Leg Higher",
    "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) has opened 2026 with renewed momentum, extending a recovery that began in the final days of December and pushing prices back above key psychological levels. Related Reading: XRP Is Setting Up For Its ‘Next Explosive Move,’ Analysts Say: Here’s The Target After ending 2025 with a modest decline that challenged expectations around the traditional four-year cycle, the largest asset has reclaimed the $90,000 zone and is trading above $92,000. The move reflects a mix of technical breakouts, steady institutional inflows, and easing selling pressure, even with long-term skepticisms. BTC's price records moderate gains on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Technical Structure Points to Higher Levels On the daily chart, Bitcoin (BTC) has been forming a rounded base that resembles the early stages of a cup-and-handle pattern, a structure often associated with trend continuation. Recent candles have closed higher, though long upper wicks suggest some resistance near current levels. Analysts note that maintaining a sustained hold above the $89,500–$90,000 range is crucial to sustaining the bullish setup. A confirmed break above the $94,700 area could validate the pattern and open the door to a measured move toward the $100,000–$104,000 zone, implying roughly 10–12% upside from recent prices. Shorter-term indicators also show improving momentum, with higher lows forming on lower time frames and moving averages beginning to turn upward. However, elevated leverage on derivatives platforms means that pullbacks could still trigger sharp liquidations if support levels are breached. Bitcoin ETF Inflows and On-Chain Data Support the Move Beyond charts, underlying market data points to reduced distribution. Exchange inflows have dropped sharply since the end of December, signaling lower immediate selling pressure. On-chain metrics show both short-term and long-term holders moving fewer coins, suggesting a preference to hold rather than sell into strength. Institutional demand has also re-emerged through spot Bitcoin ETFs. Early January saw more than $600 million in net inflows in a single session, reinforcing the view that larger investors continue to treat Bitcoin as a portfolio allocation rather than a short-term trade. This steady accumulation has helped Bitcoin absorb macro-driven volatility, including recent geopolitical headlines that briefly lifted broader risk assets. Skepticism Remains as Market Eyes 2026 Outlook Not everyone is convinced the recovery will last. Economist Peter Schiff has reiterated his long-standing view that Bitcoin’s rally is unsustainable, arguing that recent gains in precious metals offer a stronger long-term case.
