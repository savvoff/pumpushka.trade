    "title": "Bitcoin Suppression? Analyst Claims Single Force Keeping Price Under $90K",
    "body": "Bitcoin drifted under $83,000 on Thursday as market focus shifted toward how liquidity is stacked on exchanges. Reports say a mix of big orders and tight ranges has left traders feeling boxed in. Some analysts warn that a break under a key level could spark sharper selling, while others point to concentrated buy orders that might cushion a drop. Related Reading: Gold, Silver Steal The Spotlight As Crypto Hype Fades On Social Media: Santiment Order-Book Pressure And Liquidity According to trading-room data, one group or a cluster of large accounts appears to be shaping short-term moves by placing big bids and offers in the order book. This can keep price stuck in a narrow band. Material Indicators’ research flagged a pattern where bids are clustering around $85,000 to $87,500 — a zone that could act like a floor for now. The idea is simple: by piling up liquidity at certain prices, large players can get fills on their orders or discourage quick recoveries before options expiry. Market participants say this kind of behavior can trap less-experienced traders who react to sudden moves. At times, the pressure seems deliberate; at other times, it may be a byproduct of many traders aiming for the same levels. Either way, the result has been choppy price action and rising tension in the book.

A significant amount of… pic.twitter.com/c63miAxBkh — Material Indicators (@MI_Algos) January 29, 2026 Whales, Wyckoff And The Spring Idea Reports note that a group of traders using Wyckoff-style thinking expects a “spring” — a drop below recent lows that then leads to a strong bounce as heavy hands buy at lower prices. Pseudonymous analysts have pointed to $86,000 as a strong buy wall provided by large orders. One commentator shared charts showing how a quick dip under $80,000 could serve as the spring before a rebound. Some traders view this pattern as part of accumulation. Others see it as a risky setup that could widen losses if support fails. The truth may sit between those views: both accumulation and the risk of a flush are possible in a tense market. Bitcoin Price Action Bitcoin has been moving in a tight range after failing to hold above $90,000. Price slid near $82,300 as fresh worries about monetary policy and world events hit risk assets. Volatility has been low at times and then spikes quickly, which makes trading tricky. Buyers have stepped in at certain levels, but they have not yet forced a clear break higher. Geopolitics And Fed Moves Reports say rising tensions in parts of the Middle East and talk about a new Federal Reserve chair pick have added to uncertainty. Some investors fear tighter policy would drain liquidity from markets and weigh on crypto. Market chatter has even mentioned US President Donald Trump in relation to political shifts that could influence economic policy. Safe-haven flows into other assets have been seen when headlines worsen, and those moves have pulled money away from riskier holdings. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slide To $82K Sets Off A $1.7 Billion Chain Reaction Key Levels To Watch Traders should watch the $83,000–$85,000 zone closely. A daily close below $86,000 would be read by many as a negative sign and could open the door to deeper selling. On the flip side, sustained buying at those levels could set up a rally if big liquidity holders decide to lift offers. For most people, patience and clear stop rules matter right now, because the market is being pushed by both order-book tactics and outside news, and either factor can shift price fast.

    "title": "Here’s The Dogecoin Resistance Level That Is Stalling A 402% Move",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Javon Marks has released a fresh update on Dogecoin (DOGE), continuing a price analysis he has consistently shared on X since earlier last year. His latest update focuses on a resistance level currently holding Dogecoin back from a 402% rally, which could trigger a move to its next bullish target. Key Resistance Level Limits Dogecoin’s Upside Potential According to Marks, Dogecoin is holding above a key “resisting trend break” that was established following a prolonged downtrend. This level is important because the price has not fallen below it, indicating that the meme coin’s breakout structure remains intact. As long as this resistance holds, the analyst believes Dogecoin still has the potential for a significant upside move. Related Reading: Dogecoin Roadblock At $0.15: Analyst Predicts The Next Major Level Marks has highlighted $0.6533 as the critical resistance level that stands between Dogecoin and its next price rally. The analyst has said that the meme coin’s price is currently 402% below this key resistance, suggesting that DOGE’s price can only begin a substantial upward movement if it can rally as high as that. Until then, gains will likely remain limited or short-lived. One major reason Marks believes Dogecoin’s bullish structure remains uncompromised is that the meme coin continues to form higher lows on the chart. These higher lows indicate that recent selling pressure and price declines have been unable to push Dogecoin back to previous downside levels. The analyst notes that as long as this pattern persists, a move toward the $0.6533 target could simply be a matter of time. The chart also shows that Dogecoin has already confirmed a shift in structure by forming multiple higher highs after breaking the long-term descending trendline. This combination of higher highs and higher lows is typically associated with bullish market conditions. However, price must still overcome the $0.6533 resistance to validate the meme coin’s next bullish run. Marks has predicted that if Dogecoin successfully breaks above $0.6533, its next target could be $1.25111. In his previous analysis, the analyst consistently highlighted this target, noting each time that Dogecoin’s price was much closer to the $0.6533 resistance than it is now. This also indicates that, since his earlier updates, Dogecoin has continued to decline. Despite this prolonged correction, Marks remains confident in the meme coin’s bullish potential and its ability to cross the $1 threshold. Dogecoin Shows Signs Of Stabilization After Recent Drop Crypto analyst Bitguru has observed that Dogecoin may be forming a base following a recent liquidity grab. He said that the cryptocurrency has been compressing near lows and printing a long consolidation range after experiencing a sharp price decline. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Just Confirmed A Reversal With The RSI Divergence This pattern often signals that selling pressure is fading and the market is quietly resetting. With Dogecoin now showing signs of stabilization, Bitguru’s chart shows that, once the consolidation stage ends, DOGE’s price could surge from $0.11 to $0.20.

    "title": "Bitcoin Miner Fees Remain Near Cycle Lows: What Does This Signal?",
    "body": "Bitcoin has slipped below the $83,000 level as selling pressure continues to dominate global markets, extending a correction that has unfolded alongside broader risk-off conditions. Weakness across equities and commodities has weighed on investor sentiment, and Bitcoin has not been immune to this environment. With volatility elevated and liquidity thinning, market participants are increasingly cautious, and several analysts now point to the possibility of a deeper retracement toward lower demand zones before any meaningful stabilization can occur. Related Reading: XRP Risk-Adjusted Returns Signal Consolidation Rather Than Trend Formation – Details Beyond price action, on-chain data suggests that the Bitcoin network itself is entering a period of unusually low activity. Transaction demand has cooled, and miner fee generation remains muted, signaling limited urgency for blockspace. This “quiet” state reflects a market where speculative interest has faded, and organic usage is subdued, a combination that often emerges during corrective or transitional phases rather than during strong uptrends. At the same time, the lack of aggressive on-chain selling pressure indicates that the move lower is not being driven by panic but by persistent distribution and reduced participation. This creates an environment where price can drift lower with relatively little resistance. As Bitcoin searches for its next area of support, the coming sessions will be critical in determining whether current weakness evolves into a deeper correction or forms the foundation for a more durable base once activity and demand begin to recover. Bitcoin Miner Fees Signal Prolonged Network Dormancy An analysis from Onchain Mind highlights a key metric for assessing the underlying health of the Bitcoin network: the Miner Fees to Block Subsidy Ratio. This indicator measures how much of miners’ revenue comes from transaction fees compared to the fixed block reward, making it a direct proxy for organic demand for blockspace. When users are competing to have transactions included in blocks, fees rise, and this ratio increases. When activity slows, the ratio compresses. Since July, this metric has remained pinned below 1%, marking a sharp and sustained cooldown in network usage. This stands in stark contrast to the conditions seen last May, when the ratio surged above 15% during periods of heightened on-chain activity and speculative demand. At that time, elevated fees reflected strong competition for blockspace and a network operating near capacity. The current environment tells a very different story. Persistently low fee contribution suggests that transaction urgency has largely evaporated, with users showing little willingness to pay premium fees for settlement. Historically, such prolonged periods of subdued fee pressure have been associated with bear market phases, when participation declines and on-chain activity contracts. This does not signal immediate stress for miners, given the dominance of the block subsidy in revenue. However, it does underline a broader slowdown in network engagement, reinforcing the view that Bitcoin is currently operating in a low-demand, defensive phase rather than a growth-driven one.

BTC is now trading near the $83,000 area after failing to hold recent consolidation lows. The chart shows a clear sequence of lower highs and lower lows since the November peak. Confirming that the broader structure remains bearish rather than corrective. Price is firmly below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which are sloping downward and acting as dynamic resistance, while the 200-day moving average remains well above current levels, reinforcing the loss of long-term trend support.

This area had previously acted as a short-term base during December and early January. But the failure to defend it suggests that buyers are no longer willing to absorb supply at these levels. Volume spikes accompanying the latest sell-off indicate distribution rather than capitulation, pointing to continued, orderly selling pressure. The market is transitioning into a price discovery phase toward lower demand zones. If downside momentum persists, the next areas of interest lie near the $80,000 psychological level. Followed by deeper support closer to the low-$70,000 range, where previous consolidation occurred in mid-2024. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Why Litecoin Price Going To $2,000 Is Not A Fantasy, But Market Cap Math",
    "body": "Crypto pundit BigShortRare has declared that a Litecoin price rally to between $1,200 and $2,000 is not a fantasy but a marketcap math. This came as he explained exactly how the altcoin will reach this price target based on its market cap and circulating supply. Why A Litecoin Price Rally To $2,000 Could Happen In an X post, BigShortRare noted that LTC has a circulating supply of roughly 76.78 million coins. As such, a $1,200 Litecoin price will give the altcoin a market cap of about $90 billion, while at $2,000 per LTC, the altcoin’s market cap is about $150 million. The pundit remarked that these numbers sound big until they are put in context. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Litecoin Price May Be Getting Ready For Another Massive Rally BigShortRare alluded to the fact that Bitcoin has already crossed $2 trillion in market cap in the past, while Ethereum has traded above a $500 billion market cap. Furthermore, he stated that in the previous cycle, capital has repeatedly concentrated into a few large, liquid, and battle-tested assets. Therefore, a Litecoin price rally to a $90 billion to $150 billion market cap would still be a fraction of Bitcoin’s market cap and well within historical altcoin concentration ranges during late-cycle rotation. BigShortRare also mentioned that what supports that valuation range is not illusion but structure. He explained that Litecoin is fully integrated across exchanges, wallets, payment processors, and merchant rails. The pundit added that the altcoin has a fixed supply, no VC overhang, no emissions surprises, and no dependency on speculative incentives. LTC is also said to function as a settlement and payment network, not a promise. “LTC Is The OG” BigShortRare also noted that LTC is an OG crypto project, which is another reason why he is confident that the Litecoin price can rally to as high as $2,000. He stated that when markets rotate from experimentation to reliability, capital doesn’t spread evenly but rather compresses into assets that already work at scale. Related Reading: XRP, HBAR, And Litecoin: Pundit Highlights Coins To Watch In 2026 The pundit remarked that a $1,200 to $2,000 price tag for LTC doesn’t require it to replace Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead, it only requires the market to price Litecoin as a major monetary rail and not a side character. “That’s not a prediction of timing. It’s a valuation argument. Price decides when. Structure decides if,” he concluded. It is worth noting that BigShortRare’s thesis was in support of crypto analyst Surf’s prediction that the Litecoin price was about to rally to $2,000. His accompanying chart showed that the rally to this price target could happen by 2028. At the time of writing, the Litecoin price is trading at around $64, down over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "Bitcoin’s Digital Gold Thesis Faces Reality As Gold Surges Ahead",
    "body": "Bitcoin was designed to function as digital gold, a decentralised store of value that protects wealth from inflation, currency debasement, and the long-term dominance of the dollar. Currently, the market behaviour is telling a different story as de-dollarisation accelerates and investors seek safety from geopolitical risk and inflation pressures, with gold capturing the bulk of that capital. Is Bitcoin Still A Store Of Value Or A Risk Asset? Crypto investor Himanshu Sinha has stated on X that Bitcoin was supposed to be digital gold because it was built for de-dollarisation, but gold and silver are winning the trade and fulfilling that role. Over the past year, gold has risen by roughly 55%, silver has surged around 150%, while BTC has remained flat. Related Reading: What’s Going On With Bitcoin And The Stock Market? Analyst Breaks It Down The Central banks are the drivers; they don’t want volatility that they can’t manage, and they don’t want an asset that moves in lockstep with the Nasdaq. Instead, they want a controllable monetary infrastructure, and they’re buying gold at the highest rate in history. Just hours ago, gold hit $5,600, then collapsed by 8.21% in a straight vertical drop to $5,140, which is a textbook margin liquidation. At the same time, Microsoft dropped 11.7% as tech sold their gold because it was their only profitable asset, and the investors needed cash fast. This is the same liquidity contagion that used to be seen in the crypto market. According to Sinha, gold cannot be sanctioned in a bar. As the West weaponizes the dollar through sanctions and financial controls, the rest of the world needs a neutral exit. In the end, BTC still proved it is a speculative tool, while gold is proving to be the replacement. Why Gold Is Likely To Keep Outperforming Bitcoin A crypto trader known as Doctor Profit pointed out that nearly a year ago, he shared a Gold versus Bitcoin chart, highlighting that once 0.02 BTC equals 1 ounce of gold, it should mark the top for BTC. Meanwhile, when 0.11 BTC equals 1 ounce of gold, it marks the bottom for BTC. This happened in 2021 during the BTC top and during the BTC bottom in 2022. Related Reading: Expert Who Nailed The Bitcoin Top Now Says Buy At These Levels According to Doctor Profit, the analysis was later proven right this year by calling the BTC top at $125,000 at 0.02 for 1 ounce of gold. Calculating this move, if 1 BTC is $5,500 in gold price and divided by 0.11, it should be $50,000 BTC, which matches the analysis of BTC bottom for this cycle between $50,000 and $60,000 BTC. However, the analysis played out as expected. If calculated with a gold price of $7,000, the equivalent of BTC bottom should be around $63,000, which also aligns with the bottom target. In the Doctor Profit view, gold might continue to outperform BTC in the coming months. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Why Gold & Silver’s All-Time Highs Are Very Bullish For Bitcoin And Altcoins",
    "body": "Gold and silver have recently dominated headlines, outperforming both Bitcoin and altcoins in the broader crypto market. While both precious metals recorded new all-time highs in 2026, many altcoins failed to reach similar milestones. Bitcoin, by contrast, did achieve an ATH in 2025; however, following that peak, its price retraced sharply to new lows. With this in mind, analysts argue that the strength of gold and silver does not pose a threat to digital assets. Instead, they interpret the divergence as a major bullish signal for Bitcoin and altcoins. Gold And Silver ATH Signals Bitcoin And Altcoins Upside Crypto market expert Mark Chadwick delivered a detailed analysis of precious metals and cryptocurrencies on X this week, pointing to what he calls “the biggest price divergence” ever recorded between gold and Bitcoin. His chart and analysis suggest that a strong performance in gold could be a major indicator for a potential rally in cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Continue To Decline If This Doesn’t Happen; Analyst Chadwick noted that gold has surged aggressively, reaching an ATH of over $5,600 in January 2026. This price rally has pushed the metal into extreme overbought levels on higher timeframes. In contrast, Bitcoin is facing prolonged weakness and negative sentiment in 2026, despite reaching an all-time high above $126,000 in October 2025. The analyst suggested that this performance imbalance has reached levels that typically signal a major market shift. Gold and silver have been boosted by factors such as central bank accumulation, inflation hedging, and geopolitical pressures. At the same time, Bitcoin has been weighed down by tighter liquidity, reduced investor interest, and risk-off conditions. As a result, traditional safe-haven assets have entered overbought territory, leaving BTC and altcoins largely overlooked. Chadwick argues that markets move in cycles driven by sentiment and positioning. When one asset becomes excessively overbought, returns diminish, and capital seeks higher upside elsewhere. In past macro cycles, periods of strong performance in gold and silver have often been followed by capital rotating into higher-risk assets once fear subsides. Based on his analysis, Bitcoin’s current positioning reflects exhaustion rather than structural weakness. Chadwick believes that when manipulation ends and capital starts flowing out of gold and silver into BTC, it could set the stage for a sharp rebound in the leading cryptocurrency. Since altcoins typically follow Bitcoin’s performance, the analyst expects that once Bitcoin regains momentum, some of that profit could also rotate into select altcoins, fueling a price rally. Related Reading: XRP Prints Bullish Divergence On The Weekly Chart, But Is ATHs Still Possible? How High Bitcoin And Altcoins Could Rally Chadwick has stated that Bitcoin’s price could easily surge 10x as capital flows back into it and market sentiment and liquidity improve. However, the chart outlines a short-term rally, projecting a 91.60% rise to $170,000 from the $82,000 region. The analyst also predicted that altcoins could rise 50-100x, reflecting a staggering potential for gains in the crypto market. He concluded his analysis by emphasizing that smart money knows massive returns often come from diversification. From this perspective, the current ATHs of gold and silver do not undermine cryptocurrencies but signal an upcoming shift in capital. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Ethereum Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech",
    "body": "According to reports, Vitalik Buterin has pulled 16,384 ETH from his reserves and plans to spend it on privacy and truly open technology. That move is paired with a call for five years of thrift at the Ethereum Foundation so the foundation can keep building core software while staying healthy for the long run. Related Reading: Gold, Silver Steal The Spotlight As Crypto Hype Fades On Social Media: Santiment A New Focus On Privacy And Openness Reports say the funds, worth about $45 million, will back a broad list of projects: open silicon, secure hardware, private messaging, local-first operating systems, and tools that mix zero-knowledge proofs with other privacy tools like FHE and differential privacy. He has already put money toward encrypted messaging and air quality work, and some new efforts aim to make secure hardware more affordable and verifiable. The plan covers both pieces of tech and the systems people run on them. Simple apps for daily life are included, not just fancy research. In these five years, the Ethereum Foundation is entering a period of mild austerity, in order to be able to simultaneously meet two goals: 1. Deliver on an aggressive roadmap that ensures Ethereum’s status as a performant and scalable world computer that does not compromise on… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 30, 2026 Personal Money For Public Good Buterin is taking on what might once have been “special projects” of the foundation. He withdrew the ETH personally, and reports note he is looking at secure, decentralized staking to route future staking rewards into these efforts. That shifts some financial risk from institutions to an individual who wants those projects to survive even when they are slow or controversial. Some of the initiatives are unlikely to attract fast capital. That is why personal backing matters. A Stronger Core, Not Bigger Hype The Foundation is said to be entering a phase of mild austerity so it can meet two clear goals at once: finish an aggressive technical roadmap and remain alive and independent into the far future. The technical aim is to keep Ethereum fast and scalable without losing decentralization or security. At the same time, the team wants to protect users’ ability to control their keys, their data, and their privacy. Reports note that “Ethereum for people who need it” is the guiding line, rather than chasing large corporate deals that transform how people use the chain.

    "title": "Avalanche (AVAX) Defies Bear Market With Explosive On‑Chain Growth, Messari",
    "body": "A newly released report from crypto market intelligence firm Messari offers a detailed look at Avalanche’s (AVAX) performance during the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2025, revealing a sharp contrast between weak price action and record‑breaking on‑chain activity. Metrics Climb Even As AVAX Suffers Steep Q4 Decline According to Messari, Avalanche’s native token, AVAX, experienced a steep decline during the final quarter of the year. The token fell 59.0% quarter‑over‑quarter (QoQ) and 65.5% year‑over‑year (YoY), dropping from around $30.00 at the end of Q3 in September to approximately $12.30 by the close of Q4. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slides Toward $85,000 Despite Progress On US Crypto Market Structure Bill Avalanche’s circulating market capitalization mirrored that drop, falling 58.3% QoQ and 63.9% YoY from $12.7 billion to $5.3 billion. Yet, the decline in valuation also impacted Avalanche’s relative standing among digital assets. AVAX slipped from 14th to 21st place in rankings by circulating market cap over the quarter. Despite this, Messari highlighted that network usage continued to expand, effectively breaking the typical link between token price performance and network fees. While total fees measured in US dollars declined 11.7% QoQ, that drop was modest compared with the 59.0% fall in AVAX’s price. In native terms, fees paid on the network increased meaningfully. Fees denominated in AVAX rose 24.9% QoQ, climbing from 105,719 AVAX to 132,016 AVAX. Average daily transactions on the C‑Chain jumped 63% to 2.1 million, while a wave of liquidations during the market crash on October 10, 2025, generated $520,715 in transaction fees. Messari noted that this was the highest single‑day fee total recorded on Avalanche since February 2024. Avalanche Sees Record Transaction And User Activity Looking more broadly, Avalanche’s ecosystem reached new activity highs in Q4 2025. Aggregate usage across the C‑Chain and all Avalanche Layer‑1 networks accelerated sharply. Average daily transactions increased 4.5% QoQ and surged 1,162.1% YoY to 38.2 million. At the same time, average daily active addresses climbed 25.1% QoQ and an extraordinary 16,360.3% YoY, reaching 24.7 million. Activity on the C‑Chain alone reached historic levels. Average daily transactions rose 69.0% QoQ and 799.3% YoY, making Q4 2025 the busiest quarter on record for the chain. Staking metrics, however, reflected the pressure from falling prices. The total USD value of staked AVAX declined 59.9% QoQ and 69.1% YoY to $2.3 billion, largely tracking the token’s price drop. Rising DeFi Base And Major RWA Growth Avalanche’s decentralized finance ecosystem also continued to evolve despite market headwinds. Messari reported that the DeFi Diversity Score, which measures how many protocols account for 90% of total value locked, rose 5.9% QoQ and 63.6% YoY, increasing from 17.0 to 18.0. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Begins To Rise, Raising Early Bear Market Concerns Total DeFi TVL across Avalanche L1s and the C‑Chain declined 41.9% QoQ and 3.8% YoY, falling from $2.2 billion to $1.3 billion. At the same time, the network’s stablecoin market cap grew modestly, increasing 1.7% QoQ and 24.3% YoY to $1.8 billion. As seen in the chart above, measured in AVAX rather than dollars, native DeFi TVL rose 34.5% QoQ to 97.5 million AVAX, even as USD‑denominated TVL fell 44.9%. Messari explained that this divergence occurred because AVAX’s price declined faster than the underlying value held within DeFi protocols. One of the strongest areas of growth for Avalanche in Q4 was real‑world assets (RWAs). RWA TVL jumped 68.6% QoQ and 949.3% YoY, rising from $789.8 million at the end of Q3 to $1.33 billion by the close of Q4 2025. Featured image from OpenArt, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin To $30,000? Analysts Warn BTC Crash Could Be Deeper Than Expected",
    "body": "After bouncing 2.6% from recent lows, Bitcoin (BTC) has been attempting to turn the $82,000-$83,000 area into support. Some analysts have warned that the cryptocurrency must hold the crucial macro support levels or it will “confirm bearish acceleration.” Related Reading: Ethereum Drops Below $2,800 As Crypto Liquidations Near $1B – Should Investors Worry? Bitcoin To Drop 76% From its Peak On Thursday, Bitcoin crashed alongside the rest of the market, retracing nearly 9% in a day toward the $81,314 area. BTC had been trading between $86,000-$93,500 since early November, closing above the lower boundary of its two-month range in the weekly timeframe despite constant volatility. At the moment, the flagship cryptocurrency has lost this key support in the daily timeframe and risks a deeper correction if the price doesn’t recover the $86,000 level before the end of the week. As the price hovers between levels not seen since the late November correction, a market observer has warned that the leading cryptocurrency has lost its 100-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as support. Ted Pillows asserted that the last two times Bitcoin had a weekly close below the 100-week EMA, back in 2018 and 2022, it dropped 50% in just 4-6 weeks. Moreover, he highlighted BTC’s historical pattern, noting that the cryptocurrency has repeated a similar performance between the 2017-2018 and 2021-2022 cycles. The chart shows an eight-year ascending trendline that has marked the top of the previous cycles. The trendline began during the late 2017 peak and continued into the next bull market, marking the 2021 cycle top too. Notably, the 2018 bear market correction saw Bitcoin retrace 83.11% from the ascending trendline, while the 2022 pullback had BTC dropping 77.57% from the cycle top. Per the chart, this has formed a rising support line that has marked where BTC’s price bottomed during previous bear markets. Now, Bitcoin has seemingly topped around the trendline once again and could retrace up to 76.88% toward the $30,000 mark in 2026, if history repeats. BTC Retests Macro Triangle Bottom Analyst Rekt Capital also shared his perspective on BTC’s recent pullback now that it has broken down from its weekly price range and is revisiting the $82,500 bottom of its Macro Triangle formation. The analyst explained that Bitcoin has been forming a triangle pattern in the monthly timeframe since mid-2024, similar to its 2021 triangle formation that preceded the previous bear market. Per the analysis, the flagship crypto has shown a nearly identical price action to its 2021-2022 performance, with the price respecting the macro support and descending resistance. A breakdown from the macro triangle bottom “would confirm Bearish Acceleration,” he noted, adding that for bull market continuation, the cryptocurrency would need to break and hold above the macro descending resistance on longer timeframes. “Until then, we have more evidence that maybe we will be following 2021 [performance]. (…) It’s just a little bit more compressed.” He also pointed out that BTC is displaying a similar Bull Market EMAs crossover that occurred during the early stages of the previous bear market.

Rekt Capital highlighted that the imminent crossover does not necessarily predict additional downside, but “is effectively confirming weakness, kind of responding to the weakness that we are already seeing and have seen for a while.” “History is suggesting to us that if we continue to make these macro lower highs, which are a result of weakening demand at historical support regions, then there’s more reason to be bearish rather than bullish,” he concluded.

    "title": "Hyperliquid (HYPE) Rally: Expert Suggests Continued Growth, $35 Target Looms",
    "body": "Hyperliquid (HYPE) has emerged as one of the few large‑cap cryptocurrencies showing sustained strength across multiple time frames, even as the broader digital asset market remains under pressure. While Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and most major tokens have struggled amid a market‑wide pullback, Hyperliquid has continued to post notable gains, setting it apart during what many consider the early stages of a bear market. What’s Driving Hyperliquid Higher Market data from CoinGecko shows that HYPE surged roughly 31% over the past week, pushing the token toward the $34 level earlier in the week, and marking its highest price in more than a month. Over the past 14 days, HYPE is up around 17%, while gains of 13% and 8% were recorded over the 30‑day and year‑over‑year periods, respectively. By comparison, Bitcoin has fallen 12% over two weeks, slipped 4% over the past month, and is down roughly 21% year‑over‑year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Begins To Rise, Raising Early Bear Market Concerns Experts have pointed to fundamental and structural developments as key drivers behind HYPE’s performance. Crypto analyst Elite Crypto highlighted the impact of Hyperliquid’s HIP‑3 upgrade, which introduced permissionless perpetual contracts tied to real‑world assets (RWAs) such as gold, silver, and other commodities. According to the analyst, trading activity in these products has expanded rapidly, with silver‑based perpetuals alone exceeding $1 billion in daily volume on many occasions. Elite Crypto also pointed to signs of institutional accumulation, noting that decentralized autonomous traders, including strategies operating directly on Hyperliquid, have been steadily increasing their exposure. In addition, research firm Citrini has published bullish commentary on the platform, and speculation around a potential HYPE exchange‑traded fund (ETF) has added to market interest. HYPE Faces Crucial Technical Test From a technical perspective, analysts see important levels coming into focus. DeFi Guru noted that HYPE is currently testing its primary descending resistance, describing recent price action as impulsive and confidence‑driven, suggesting a shift in momentum. The analyst identified $30 as a key level to reclaim decisively. A clean move above that area could open the door to the next major target near $35, which aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slides Toward $85,000 Despite Progress On US Crypto Market Structure Bill Another analyst, Efloud, offered a more cautious view and outlined potential support and resistance zones for Hyperliquid. He identified a key support region near the $23.7 level, which is crucial in determining whether the cryptocurrency will continue its rally. Efloud noted that price has already reached an intermediate resistance area and suggested that short‑side setups would only be considered if bearish market structure appears on lower time frames, either at current levels or closer to the $38–$39 range. Despite the broader bullish narrative, Hyperliquid has not been immune to short‑term volatility. Over the past 24 hours, HYPE has pulled back by roughly 10%, falling toward around $29. Analyst Ox Kaize described the recent dip as a normal market reaction, particularly given recent developments affecting both gold and Bitcoin. He asserts that a recovery in those markets could provide additional upside momentum for Hyperliquid, potentially pushing the token toward the $50 level. Additional catalysts remain on the horizon. A second Hyperliquid airdrop is expected in the near future, and Kaize believes the timing could be deliberate, as distributing tokens while prices remain below peak levels may support longer‑term ecosystem growth.

    "title": "Trump Nominates Pro-Crypto Kevin Warsh For New Fed Chair — Details",
    "body": "United States President Donald Trump has unveiled former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as his pick for the next chair of the US central bank. This move confirms the circulating rumors after the former Fed governor reportedly met with Trump at the White House on Thursday, January 29. Trump Pushes Warsh To Senate For Fed Chair Position On Friday, January 30, Trump, via his social media platform Truth Social, announced his nomination of ex-Fed official Kevin Warsh as the successor of Jerome Powell as the Federal Reserve chairman. Prior to this announcement, prediction platforms had heavily tipped Warsh as Trump’s likely pick. Related Reading: Why Litecoin Price Going To $2,000 Is Not A Fantasy, But Market Cap Math Warsh previously served on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011 and held senior roles at the White House National Economic Council during former President George Bush’s administration. The former Morgan Stanley banker was considered for the Fed chair job in 2017 before Powell was eventually appointed. Trump said in his announcement: I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best. On top of everything else, he is “central casting,” and he will never let you down. Congratulations Kevin! Warsh has been a vocal critic of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy long before Powell became chair. Unsurprisingly, his recent stance appears to align with Trump’s agenda of lowering interest rates. In fact, the former Wall Street executive said in an interview last July that President Trump was right to push the Fed to cut rates. Trump’s nomination of Warsh as the Fed chair still needs to be confirmed by the US Senate, with many commentators expecting a battle between the executive and legislative arms. While Trump seeks a Fed chair that listens to the White House, a homage that Powell has refused to pay, the Senate believes the Federal Reserve should function independently. What Does Warsh’s Selection Mean For Crypto? Warsh and Powell seem to be on opposite sides of the divide when it comes to the cryptocurrency industry and Bitcoin. While the current Federal Reserve chair has consistently played down BTC’s relevance in the greater US economy, Warsh has been fairly positive about the world’s largest cryptocurrency. In a recent conversation hosted by the Hoover Institution, Warsh said that Bitcoin is an important asset that doesn’t trouble him, and he doesn’t view the coin as a substitute for the dollar. “Bitcoin can help inform policymakers when they are doing things right or wrong,’ the former Morgan Stanley banker said.

    "title": "Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio Spikes To New High — Fresh Volatility Ahead?",
    "body": "After surging toward the $100,000 mark a few days into the new year, the price of Bitcoin looks set to end January in stark contrast to how it started the month. On Thursday, January 29, the flagship cryptocurrency fell to a multi-month low of around $81,500, with the general market sentiment worsening over the past few weeks. Going into the weekend, the price of Bitcoin has somewhat cooled off, recovering above the $93,000 level on Friday, January 30. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data suggests that the market leader is only on the verge of another violent price movement. BTC Setting Up For A Violent Liquidation Cascade In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, CryptoOnchain shared insights into the current on-chain condition of the Bitcoin price. According to the market quant, the Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) witnessed a notable upswing on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, while price was undergoing its most recent correction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Needs Deeper Liquidity Before A Real Recovery Takes Shape: Analysts For context, the Estimated Leverage Ratio is an on-chain metric that tracks the ratio between open interest and the reserve of an exchange (Binance, in this case). This metric measures the average amount of leverage used by the traders in a particular market or exchange. A higher ELR signals a higher market risk, suggesting that small price movements could lead to significant liquidations. According to data from CryptoQuant, CryptoOnchain highlighted that the Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio recently spiked to a critical level of 0.188 when the price fell to around $81,500, indicating that the Open Interest is exceptionally high relative to the exchange’s reserves. Furthermore, CryptoOnchain shared that the divergence between rising leverage and falling prices is a classic “bearish divergence” signal in the derivative market. “It indicates that despite the price weakness, traders are aggressively increasing their leverage positions,” the on-chain expert added. What’s more, CryptoOnchain revealed that when the market becomes heavily over-leveraged during a price correction, it implies that the traders are either “buying the dip” with high leverage or increasingly taking short positions. The market quant said this setup usually precedes a “violent liquidation cascade.” Overall, CryptoOnchain concluded that the market is currently in a high-tension zone, with the combination of peak leverage and low prices suggesting that a “squeeze” is imminent. The analyst, however, clarified that the direction of the next violent movement depends on the dominant side (bulls or bears) of the market. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $84,200, reflecting a nearly 1% jump in the past 24 hours.
