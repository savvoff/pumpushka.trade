    "title": "Bitcoin Market Profitability Hits ‘Complete Reset’ — What’s Next For Price?",
    "body": "Following a fresh wave of bearish pressure on Friday, December 5, the price of Bitcoin has struggled beneath the psychological 90,000 level for much of the weekend. However, the latest on-chain data suggests that the premier cryptocurrency might be readying for its next healthy upward move. BTC SOPR Drops To Lowest Level Since Early 2024 In a December 6 post on the X platform, CryptoOnchain hypothesized that a local bottom appears to be forming for the price of Bitcoin. According to the market pundit, the selling pressure, especially amongst long-term holders, seems to be fading off at the moment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Structure Tightens: One Break Above This Zone Could Ignite A Run To $107,000 This market observation centers on the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric, which evaluates the profitability ratio of spent outputs for both long-term and short-term holders. This on-chain indicator evaluates whether market participants are selling their assets at a profit or at a loss. Typically, when the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio has a value greater than 1, it indicates that the investors are selling at a profit. On the flip side, an SOPR value less than 1 implies that the market participants are offloading their coins while in the red. According to CryptoOnchain, the Bitcoin SOPR has now fallen to 1.35, its lowest level since early 2024. The market analyst noted that this metric’s latest movement suggests a complete reset in market profitability, especially as the price of BTC slid beneath the $90,000 mark. Furthermore, CryptoOnchain highlighted that the heavy profit-taking phase by long-term holders appears to be coming to an end, as exhaustion and fatigue increasingly spread among the bears. From a historical perspective, the SOPR metric falling to this low signals a local bottom is forming for the BTC price, especially as the market cools down. Ultimately, CryptoOnchain revealed that a price rebound at this point could set the stage for Bitcoin’s next healthy upward rally. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $89,500, reflecting no significant changes in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency is down by nearly 2% in the last seven days.

    "title": "Bitcoin Market Records 21% Crash In November Trading Volume – What This Means For Price",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s (BTC) ongoing price correction has been accompanied by several other negative developments that continue to grab investors’ attention. Most recently, market analyst Darkfost has observed a significant crash in Bitcoin spot trading volume, while highlighting potential long-term implications of such an event. Related Reading: Here’s Why Bitcoin Volatility Sparks Fresh Attention On MicroStrategy Binance Records $40B Loss In BTC Monthly Spot Trading The spot trading volume refers to the total amount of Bitcoin that is bought and sold for immediate delivery on exchanges within a specific time period. It is a key market indicator used to gauge participation, liquidity, and investor interest. According to Darkfost in an X post on December 6, the Bitcoin market, in November, experienced a major fall in spot trading volume across major crypto exchanges. This development has been attributed to the asset’s price struggles, wherein it recorded a 17.5% devaluation during this period. On Binance, which accounts for more than half of all Bitcoin spot trading activity, spot volume fell from $198 billion in October to $156 billion in November, representing a 21% decline. The downturn was mirrored across other major exchanges, with ByBit posting a 13.5% drop, Gate.io sliding 33%, and OKX down 18%. Interestingly, Darkfost explains that Bitcoin’s recent price action, the major negative catalyst, pales in comparison to previous corrections. However, another red reading in December could initiate a market deterioration marked by conditions such as continued selling pressure, low market confidence, and, importantly, further drops in spot activity. A continuous decline in spot trading volume primarily mirrors a lack of market interest and is accompanied by other concerning factors, such as a weaker demand, high vulnerability to price swings, and limited support for rallies as investors prefer to sit on the sidelines. This dynamic, in turn, weighs on price growth, creating a self-reinforcing bearish loop. Related Reading: The $13.5 Billion Liquidity Injection That Could Send Bitcoin And Crypto Prices Flying Spot Trading Volume Peak Sees Consistent Regression In related news, Darkfost also reports that the present market cycle has featured a consistent decline in spot trading volume peaks. Notably, the chart above shows a market high of $333.57 billion on Binance in March 2024, followed by the lower peak of $246.04 billion in November 2024, and then just $198.6 billion last October. This trend becomes even more concerning when looking at the spot-to-futures volume ratio, which currently sits at 0.23, meaning futures activity now accounts for more than 75% of overall trading. In essence, while the Bitcoin market remains active, investor enthusiasm on the spot side is fading. By contrast, traders appear increasingly willing to speculate in the futures market, likely driven by elevated uncertainty and short-term volatility. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $89,300, reflecting a 0.21% loss in the past day. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",

    "title": "Altcoin Rally Alert: 4 Bullish Signals To Watch Out For – Analyst",
    "body": "Prominent market analyst Michael Van de Poppe has shared four market conditions that would confirm an altcoin market rally. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market continues to experience a widespread correction, weighing down the price growth of several assets. Ethereum Outperforms Bitcoin: A Positive Sign For Altcoins? Ethereum has shown more resilience in the last month than Bitcoin, which is largely interpreted as a bullish signal for altcoin enthusiasts. In the last week alone, the prominent altcoin reported a slight market gain of 0.86% compared to Bitcoin’s loss of 1.95%. When Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin, it encourages increased altcoin activity, as investor confidence spreads beyond the market leader into the broader crypto ecosystem. However, a full altcoin market takeover only comes into effect after the following technical developments. Firstly, de Poppe explains that Bitcoin, as the market leader, must achieve a breakthrough above $92,000 resistance, potentially testing the $100,000 mark, to signal renewed market strength. Additionally, the analyst states the ETH/BTC ratio must stay above its 20-day moving average (MA), indicating Ethereum’s continued dominance and further encouraging altcoin accumulation. Together, these signals could set the technical bedrock for a significant altcoin rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Break $97K To Restore Confidence Among Youngest Long-Term Holders – Details Macro Factors Could Amplify Altcoin Gains Beyond crypto-specific indicators, de Poppe also touches on broader financial market plays that could initiate the next altcoin move. The analyst suggests that a 5-10% correction in gold prices, coupled with a peak in silver, could encourage capital to flow into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies including cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, a strong upward movement in the Nasdaq would indicate increased investor risk appetite, a development that often translates into heightened activity in the crypto markets. When combined with positive momentum in Bitcoin and Ethereum, these macro signals could create an environment ripe for a substantial altcoin rally. According to de Poppe, the fulfillment of these conditions indicates that altcoins could achieve market gains of 200%-300% in the present market cycle. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows Signs Of Accumulation As CVD Strengthens And Correlation Stays Elevated Market Overview At the time of writing, the total cryptocurrency market is valued at $3.04 trillion, following a significant 15.5% decline over the past month. Meanwhile, the altcoin market cap stands at $1.26 trillion, accounting for 41.44% of all circulating digital assets. In tandem, data from CoinMarketCap shows the altseason index at 20/100, as Bitcoin still maintains a dominant grip on overall market performance, with a 58.6% dominance. In short, the conditions for a full-scale altcoin breakout have yet to materialize, but the key indicators highlighted above suggest that scenario may be approaching if momentum shifts decisively toward risk assets.

    "title": "Altcoins Struggle, But Technical Analysis Says A Major Opportunity Is Forming",
    "body": "The latest market conditions have pushed hopes of an altcoin season even further out of reach. Bitcoin continues to dominate the market with a 59.6% share, and its recent struggle to hold bullish momentum has not translated into any meaningful boost for altcoins. Related Reading: Italy’s Market Watchdog Gives Crypto Firms A Clear Order: Act Or Exit Broader sentiment has weakened as well, with the CMC Altcoin Season Index registering just 20, which still places the entire market in a Bitcoin-favored phase. Meanwhile, a critical indication has been detected from on-chain data that suggests this may be a rare moment to accumulate strong altcoin positions before conditions eventually turn. Altcoins Stay Subdued As Market Sentiment Worsens Altcoin performance has really been lagging behind Bitcoin throughout this year, and the persistent weakness is now being reflected across multiple market indicators. Bitcoin’s dominance has only increased, meaning the capital rotation that typically sparks an altcoin season has yet to begin. The wait for an altcoin breakout has now stretched far longer than many anticipated. Even as the Bitcoin price is struggling, traders have not redirected liquidity toward altcoins. The leading cryptocurrency is now down by 28.9% from its October all-time high of $126,080. Instead, altcoins have also stayed muted, and their combined market cap shows no signs of outperforming the leading cryptocurrency. Data from CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index shows the reading is currently at 20. The low reading shows that altcoins are still losing ground relative to Bitcoin. To put this into context, the index was at a reading of 83 this time last year. CMC Altcoin Season Index The sentiment is also evident in CoinMarketCap’s Fear and Greed Index, which is now at 22. Readings this low signal hesitation across the market, as investors shy away from taking new positions, and this environment makes an altcoin season much harder to materialize. CMC crypto fear and greed index CryptoQuant Data Signals A High-Value Accumulation Window Technical analysis using data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant shows that altcoin traders may be entering another window that has frequently been favorable for accumulation. The data compares the 30-day trading volume of altcoins against their yearly average and finds that current volumes have slipped back below that long-term line. Each time this pattern has appeared in past cycles, it marked a period when activity was unusually quiet and traders were hesitant, but it also tended to show up just before the market picked up again.

These low-volume stretches can last for weeks or even months, giving investors enough room to build their positions gradually. Aggregated altcoin trading volume for stablecoin quote pairs: CryptoQuant The message from the data is that this calmer part of the cycle may offer one of the better chances to position ahead of the next broader market move.
