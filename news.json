    "title": "Can Dogecoin Really Fall To $0.05 In 2026? This Analyst Thinks So",
    "body": "Dogecoin traders have heard the “five-cent” call before. It’s the kind of number that sounds like bait until price action starts behaving like it might actually get there. On Friday, DOGE was changing hands around $0.140, up slightly on the day, while bitcoin hovered near $92,300. That’s the backdrop for a fresh warning from YouTube analyst VisionPulsed, who told viewers his “base case” is that Dogecoin revisits the $0.05–$0.06 zone over the next 12 months — a window that drags the target straight into 2026. Will Dogecoin Crash To $0.05 In 2026? In the video posted on December 11 and titled “WHY IS DOGECOIN CRASHING!? BITCOIN RALLY COMING OR BULL TRAP FOR 5 CENT DOGE in 2026!?, the gist of his argument is pretty simple: if bitcoin is in a bear regime, DOGE doesn’t need an extra reason to bleed. “The base case here is that Bitcoin has entered a bear market,” he said, pointing to a cluster of indicators he watches, including an 8-day moving average near $102,000 and the Gaussian Channel. As long as BTC sits below those levels — he cited roughly $103,000 as a line in the sand — he thinks the path of least resistance for Dogecoin trends down toward five cents. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds And he wasn’t exactly selling it as a clean, one-way trip. There’s a lot of “chop zone” talk in the video — his term for the period where traders get whipsawed trying to long bounces and short dips. “The peanut gallery,” he called it. His chart-based rationale leans on a familiar pattern from 2022: even when bitcoin managed a relief rally, DOGE still printed lower lows at points. “There is no guarantee that Dogecoin will have a relief rally. As you can see, in 2022, Dogecoin did indeed have a relief rally for the final pump with Bitcoin, but you can also see that Bitcoin made higher lows throughout the spring as Dogecoin made lower lows,” he said. In his view, one of those “unfinished” spots sits closer to $0.10 first — and then the uglier number comes back into play depending on how bitcoin behaves. That sequencing matters because it’s exactly where traders get themselves into trouble. If bitcoin bounces, DOGE might bounce too. Or it might not. VisionPulsed kept hammering that there are “many indicators” suggesting a BTC relief rally is possible, but “no guarantees” Dogecoin participates — a point he tried to underline by comparing the current tape to MicroStrategy’s tendency to go flat for weeks before a sharp move. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Volatility Returns as Market Weighs Bullish Indicators Against Recent Dip Then there’s his timing framework, which is more narrative than math but still widely used in crypto circles: the idea that around 140–150 days from a major top, markets often produce a final meaningful rally — and then price doesn’t revisit those levels for a long time. He cited examples across prior cycles (2014, 2018, 2019, 2022) to argue that once bitcoin falls into that “channel” regime, it tends to stay there until the broader downtrend has done its work. So what does $0.05 actually mean from here? From roughly $0.14, it’s a drawdown of about 64%. That’s violent, but not exactly exotic in DOGE history — which is why the call lands with some traders even if they hate hearing it. The big escape hatch, per VisionPulsed, is a bitcoin breakout: if BTC makes a new all-time high by February, he argues the bearish “base case” gets invalidated and DOGE can do what DOGE does when the market turns risk-on. Until then, he framed $0.05–$0.06 as the boring, brutal probability-weighted outcome. “So the base case for the next 12 months is essentially at some point Doge will most likely come down to these five to six cent range unless Bitcoin goes up and makes a new alltime high before February. If Bitcoin makes a new all-time high by February, then Doge will avoid that [$0.05 target] and start pumping to the moon like everybody wants,” he concluded. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.14.

    "body": "Crypto markets saw a modest lift after the US Federal Reserve made another move on rates, and traders are watching for a clearer follow-through. According to reports, the Fed has carried out three consecutive interest rate cuts totaling 0.75% from September to December. The move was widely expected. Still, market responses have been mixed and somewhat choppy. Related Reading: American Bitcoin Makes Big Buy, Adds 416 BTC To Its Stack Fed Moves And Market Takeaway According to CoinEx chief analyst Jeff Ko, much of the Fed’s action was already priced in, and the updated dot plot leaned a bit more hawkish than some had hoped. Ko pointed to $40 billion in short-term Treasury purchases as a technical step to ease liquidity and lower short-term rates, not as a broad stimulus program. Markets took the measures as mildly positive. US stocks rose, and that helped Bitcoin find some footing after an early dip. Santiment And The Short-Term Reaction Based on reports from onchain analytics firm Santiment, each cut has prompted a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” move where initial optimism is followed by short selling. 🇺🇸 The US Fed made three strategic cuts over the past 3 months, resulting in a total of an 0.75% reduction to interest rates. 1⃣ September 17, 2025: Fed lowered the target range to 4.00 %–4.25 % (from 4.25 %+) at the 16–17 Sep meeting. 2⃣ October 29, 2025: Fed cut the rate to… pic.twitter.com/X6DWypvq5t — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 11, 2025 Cuts are seen as bullish for crypto over the long haul, yet they have triggered brief pullbacks in practice. Santiment adds that a small wave of FUD or retail selling often signals that the mild post-cut downswing is finished and a bounce may follow once things calm down. Technical Levels Traders Are Watching Bitcoin was volatile in the aftermath. It fell under $90,000 then popped to $93,500 on Coinbase before settling near $92,300 at the time of reporting. Key resistance sits between $97,000 and $108,000. On the daily chart, BTC remains inside a small rising channel that sits within a larger downtrend, and technical traders note that a MACD histogram is approaching a positive crossover — a sign some see as possible renewed momentum. ETF activity has been tepid, with only $219 million in net inflows since late November, which keeps some investors cautious. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher Dollar Weakness And Equity Signals A weaker dollar has been part of the backdrop; the DXY index fell to 98.36 and is showing bearish momentum on its own MACD. Nasdaq’s move back above its 50-, 100- and 200-day simple moving averages helped lift risk assets briefly, and that has supported Bitcoin’s rebound attempts. Yet correlation with equities remains uneven — losses in stocks tend to hit Bitcoin harder than gains help it, creating an asymmetric risk profile for traders.

    "title": "Silk Road Bitcoins Are On The Move Again, Is The BTC Price Ready For Another Dump?",
    "body": "After nearly five years of dormancy, a cluster of Silk Road–linked wallets just moved 33.7 Bitcoin—roughly $3 million—in a sudden on-chain resurgence that immediately brought the BTC price back into focus. While the volume is modest, the combination of its origin, timing, and institutional destination gives it an outsized narrative impact. With Bitcoin already navigating a fragile price range, this development raises concerns about renewed downward pressure. The 33.7 BTC Silk Road BTC Transfer And Its Potential Impact On Bitcoin’s Price The movement began with a series of small outputs originating from early-era Silk Road addresses, all using the old “1…” legacy format. These wallets had last shown activity on February 2, 2021, before abruptly pushing out 176 tiny transactions that were subsequently consolidated into the bech32 address bc1qnysx9sr0s7uw39awr3hh099d5m0lvrnxz7ga54. Roughly a day later, that entire 33.7 BTC was moved again through an intermediary hop and then flagged by chain-analysis dashboards as a Coinbase Prime deposit. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Set To Surge As Sellers Show Signs Of Exhaustion The first alert about the movement came from the X account DarkWebInformer, which spotted the burst of micro-transactions. Even after this transfer, about 416 BTC—roughly $37.5 million—remains untouched in the wider group of connected addresses. This supports the idea that the 33.7 BTC shift was simply a dust-sweep or cleanup action, not a full-scale release of seized holdings. With the operational picture clear, the focus shifts to the price impact. In terms of liquidity, 33.7 BTC is far too small to trigger a market-wide dump. What matters more is the psychological effect. Bitcoin is already trading in a corrective range, and activity linked to Silk Road history can make traders cautious. Although the Coinbase Prime routing points to OTC or custodial handling rather than a spot-market sale, the optics alone can tighten risk models and stoke volatility in the BTC price. Dormant Wallets And Market Sensitivity Dormant Silk Road wallets have a history of resurfacing. In May 2025, two such wallets moved over 3,400 BTC—worth roughly $322 million—after nearly a decade of inactivity. The funds were transferred into new addresses rather than exchanges, showing that these movements do not automatically trigger selling and are more notable for their on-chain and narrative significance than for their impact on liquidity. Related Reading: Pundit Highlights The Condition That Will Trigger A 2,300% XRP Rally To $50 While these transfers have little direct effect on liquidity, Bitcoin’s current price action makes the market more sensitive to any headline. After approaching $94,000 earlier this month, BTC slipped back to $90,000–$92,000. On X, bearish analysts have highlighted a continuation pattern, with some projecting potential downside toward $88,000 – $89,000. This environment primes traders to react strongly to even minor negative catalysts, including long-dormant wallet activity. Overall, the recent Silk Road transfer is unlikely to trigger a standalone dump. The main pressure stems from Bitcoin’s fragile technical posture, making even small but symbolically significant moves capable of increasing short-term volatility.

    "title": "Why This Market Analyst Is Warning Crypto Investors To Stop Buying XRP",
    "body": "The XRP price could be on the verge of a massive crash, as a crypto analyst has identified a key technical pattern in the cryptocurrency’s structure that signals a potentially severe downturn. According to the analyst, this formation has appeared only twice in XRP’s history, and each time has preceded a devastating loss. If the pattern were to repeat, the cryptocurrency could be headed for more pain. The analyst warns traders and investors to stop buying XRP at this time, citing heightened risk. Analyst Advices Against Buying XRP As Price Crash Looms An urgent warning from market analyst Steph is Crypto has spread across the community, as he advises traders and investors to “not touch XRP anymore.” The analyst shared a video of his XRP price forecast on a recent X post, revealing that the altcoin’s long-term indicators point to a troubling setup that could mirror downturns observed during past market cycles. Related Reading: Why Now Is The Perfect Opportunity To Short Bitcoin Down To $40,000 Steph Is Crypto shared that his study of the monthly Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for XRP has revealed a new bearish crossover taking shape, signaling declining momentum. The analyst stated that XRP had formed a bearish crossover on the chart only twice since its inception in 2012. Both times this pattern appeared, the cryptocurrency underwent one of the most dramatic price crashes ever, losing over half its value right after. He explained that during the first bearish crossover in 2019, XRP crashed by more than 84%. Similarly, a second crossover reemerged in 2022, triggering a deep price decline of about 67%. It’s worth highlighting that each time XRP formed this bearish signal, it was after a major bull market. In 2018, the cryptocurrency staged a historic rally that sent its price to its current all-time high above $3.84. Likewise, the steep correction in 2022 came on the heels of an explosive 2021 bull market, one of the most powerful in crypto’s history. Just as in the past, Steph Is Crypto sees a bearish crossover forming once again in the current cycle, suggesting that the conditions are aligning for another devastating price crash. He admitted that he wishes he had not spotted this formation on XRP’s chart, underscoring his usually bullish stance on the cryptocurrency. The analyst has cautioned traders to take this historical setup seriously and to consider the possibility that XRP could revisit significantly lower price ranges if the pattern plays out. XRP Price Momentum Remains Weak XRP remains in a downward trend, with its price barely holding above $2.00. The cryptocurrency has dropped by over 15% so far this month, declined about 2.2% over the past week, and has crashed approximately 16% year to date, according to CoinMarketCap. Related Reading: Here’s Why Strategy’s $1 Billion Bitcoin Purchase Did Not Trigger A Price Rally XRP’s price momentum is weak, with little indication of a near-term recovery. The cryptocurrency’s Fear and Greed Index has slipped to 42, edging closer to the “fear” zone. This market uncertainty is being driven by the cryptocurrency’s sluggish price action, despite having passed $3.00 earlier this year and nearly challenging its all-time high.

    "body": "Crypto pundit NoLimit has explained why the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices have been dumping recently. He specifically raised claims of manipulation, with these crypto prices recording gains and then fully retracing those gains. In an X post, No Limit stated that the Bitcoin price is dumping because Binance is buying and that Coinbase is dumping a large amount of BTC. The Bitcoin decline has also sparked declines for the Ethereum and Dogecoin prices, which are known to mirror the flagship crypto. Meanwhile, the crypto pundit raised claims of BTC being manipulated. Pundit Explains What Is Happening With The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices NoLimit pointed out something weird that happened on the order books, noting a massive spike in Binance’s CVD, which didn’t come from retail suddenly buying millions of dollars in BTC. On the other hand, he stated that Coinbase’s CVD fell at the exact same time, indicating that the crypto exchange dumped some BTC, which sparked declines in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Can Hit These ‘Realistic’ Bullish Targets Before The Bear Market Begins The crypto pundit highlighted the sharp decline in Bitcoin’s price as liquidity was yanked, creating a thin order book. He further remarked that one venue is getting aggressively bid up while the other is getting drained. NoLimit explained that this is not a normal spot flow and that it is likely coordinated positioning, hedging, arbitrage, or pure manipulation. NoLimited pointed out that the Bitcoin price reacted instantly to this alleged manipulation, dropping, then pushing to $94,000, and then dropping again. This also dragged down the Ethereum and Dogecoin prices. The crypto pundit asserted that a group of people is playing with the market and that most people won’t notice until it is too late. He stated that when crypto exchanges completely disagree on net flow like this, it is usually a warning. NoLimit added that the next big move is being set up before the public catches on. The crypto pundit urged market participants to pay attention because things are about to get interesting. Another Pundit Raises Manipulation Claims Crypto pundit Vivek also indicated that the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices may be manipulated at the moment. He noted that BTC round-tripped from $94,000 to $88,000 three times in the last few days, liquidating both longs and shorts worth over $200 million. The pundit added that this is an example of clear market manipulation to wipe out both leveraged longs and shorts. Related Reading: When Will Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Go Into A Bear Market? Crypto pundit Bull Theory also recently accused Wall Street trading firm Jane Street of manipulating the Bitcoin price. This came as the pundit noted that BTC, alongside Ethereum and Dogecoin, usually declines at the market open before recovering later. Bull Theory suggested that the firm may be manipulating the market in order to buy at lower prices. Featured image from Pngtree, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "Do Kwon, the South Korean co-founder of Terraform Labs, was sentenced to 15 years in prison on December 11, 2025 in a Manhattan federal court after pleading guilty to fraud tied to the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin and its sister token, Luna. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher According to court documents and news reports, the judge described the scheme as a massive fraud that left thousands of investors facing heavy losses. Sentence And Court Ruling Judge Paul A. Engelmayer handed down the 15-year term after prosecutors urged for a sentence of up to 12 years and the defense asked for a much lighter term. Do Kwon pleaded guilty in August 2025 to conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud, and as part of the plea he agreed to forfeit roughly $19 million. The US Attorney’s office says the guilty plea admits he misled investors about how the stablecoin kept its $1 peg. Scale Of The Losses Reports have placed the market fallout from the Terra collapse at about $40 billion in erased value. Many ordinary investors lost life savings and some victims gave emotional testimony at sentencing, describing real financial ruin. News outlets and court filings tie the crash in May 2022 to a sudden loss of confidence that cascaded through markets and hurt other crypto firms. Civil Penalties And Settlements Before the criminal case reached this point, Kwon and Terraform faced a major civil action from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the SEC, Terraform Labs and Kwon agreed to pay more than $4.5 billion in disgorgement, interest and penalties, while Kwon personally faced an $80 million civil fine and a ban from crypto trading. That civil judgment was filed in 2024 and has been used by regulators as part of the overall effort to make investors whole. International Arrest And Extradition Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 after leaving Singapore; authorities say he was using forged travel documents when detained. He fought extradition in Montenegrin courts but was eventually transferred to the US late in 2024 to face federal charges. Reports outline a long legal fight across borders that ended with his return to New York to answer criminal counts. Related Reading: American Bitcoin Makes Big Buy, Adds 416 BTC To Its Stack What The Sentence Means Legal analysts say a 15-year term signals the court’s view that the fraud caused wide damage and that punishment should deter similar schemes. Victims’ statements at sentencing appear to have weighed heavily. Kwon still faces separate probes and possible charges in other countries, and the civil judgment means substantial sums are earmarked for recovery efforts tied to Terraform’s bankruptcy.

    "title": "Solana Will ‘Flip’ Ethereum, Predicts Skybridge Capital’s Scaramucci",
    "body": "Anthony Scaramucci showed up to Solana Breakpoint in Abu Dhabi wearing a tie — a small act of rebellion in a sea of hoodies — and then proceeded to make a much bigger one on stage: Solana is going to “flip” Ethereum. Scaramucci’s Solana Prediction Not in the Twitter-war, zero-sum, “ETH is dead” kind of way. More like: same league, different growth curve, and Solana ends up with the bigger market cap. “I think it will flip Ethereum, but that doesn’t mean Ethereum’s going down or anything like that. I think there’s going to be market share for Ethereum. I think they could both grow, but I think from a market capitalization perspective, I think Solana will end up growing faster,” Scaramucci told CoinDesk Live on Dec. 11. That’s been his line for a while. This time it came with a prop: his new book, Solana Rising, which dropped Dec. 9 and — according to Scaramucci — quickly hit the top of Amazon’s “new releases” list for investment management/investment strategy. He framed the book as something for the skeptics, or at least for the friends of the believers. Related Reading: Solana Enters Bear Territory: Realized Loss Now Outweighs Profit The pitch is familiar if you’ve been anywhere near crypto conferences this year, but Scaramucci’s version is unusually blunt: Solana is the fastest-growing chain, it’s stacked with activity, it’s cheap to use, and it’s easy to build on. Then you add staking, and you’ve got what he keeps calling “great tokenomics.” And yes, he’s heavily aligned. “Full disclosure,” he said, “I have a large personal holding in Solana. I have it on the firm’s balance sheet.” How large? On SkyBridge’s balance sheet, he put it at “probably 60%,” with the firm sitting on “north of a nine figure balance sheet.” His personal portfolio allocation, he estimated, is around “6% 7%.” Big, but not “I sold the house for SOL” big. Notably, Scaramucci emphasized that he’s not “chain monogamous.” He likes Avalanche. He likes Ethereum. He’s not doing maximalism. He’s doing a portfolio. “In fact, who is chain monogamous?” he joked. Related Reading: Solana Hits Critical Demand Zone — Is A Surprise Bottom Loading? The Skybridge Capital founder added: “It’s not an amorous thing. It just has to do with the realities of investing. It’s like owning a lot of stocks in your portfolio. But to me, I just think that it is the fastest growing chain. That’s the most activity of like the top 50 chains combined. It’s got lots of use cases, lots of versatility. It’s easy to develop on and it’s very low fees to transact on and it’s got great tokenomics if you want to stake your Solana like I do.” He also pointed to the debut of the first spot Solana ETF in the United States — “first staking ETF,” in his words — as another signal that we’re still early. Then came the price talk, because of course it did. Could SOL hit $300–$400 by the end of next year? “Sure,” he said, tying it to a more constructive US regulatory backdrop — specifically his hope that the CLARITY Act gets passed and unlocks “the full utilization of tokenization.” Longer term, he went bigger: “Is Solana go to $1,000 over the next five years? I really do believe that.” He also revisited Bitcoin. Same vibe: right call, wrong calendar. “I’ve been right about Bitcoin, but I’ve been wrong about timing,” Scaramucci said, sticking with a $150,000–$200,000 target, and arguing a friendlier rate environment next year could help. At press time, SOL traded at $139.14. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Crypto Market Dips: The Reasons Behind Bitcoin Plunge Below $90,000 Despite FOMC Optimism",
    "body": "On Thursday, Bitcoin (BTC) once again fell below the critical $90,000 mark, even after what many had anticipated to be a bullish event stemming from the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) decision to cut rates by a quarter point. Analysts from Bull Theory note several factors contributing to this unexpected downturn. Bitcoin Sell-Off Amid Market Unease The analysts pointed out that the rate cut itself was largely anticipated by investors weeks prior, with a 95% probability already priced into the market. Ahead of the announcement, they identified that many positioned themselves in expectation of some form of liquidity support from the Fed, leading to a rally in Bitcoin prices. However, when the actual cut and the accompanying plan for $40 billion in monthly T-bill purchases were confirmed, many of these “whales”—large investors in the market—began to take profits. Related Reading: Strategy Calls For Withdrawal Of MSCI’s Exclusion Plan For Digital Asset Treasury Companies Adding to the market’s unease was Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post-announcement press conference, where he highlighted persistent weaknesses in the labor market and ongoing inflation concerns. Furthermore, the Fed’s dot plot projections indicated the likelihood of only one additional rate cut in 2026. The situation was compounded by disappointing earnings results from Oracle, which reported its second quarter’s financials after the market’s close. The tech giant missed its adjusted revenue estimates, and higher capital expenditure projections led the stock to plunge by more than 11% in after-hours trading. This drop also negatively impacted US stock futures, as concerns grew that the artificial intelligence (AI) boom may be peaking. The widespread fear from Oracle’s results quickly spread from equities into the cryptocurrency space. Ultimately, all three factors converged to create a significant sell-off: the rate cut was already factored into the market, liquidity trades had been preemptively enacted, and Powell’s remarks did not provide the strong easing signal that some traders had hoped for. Positive Liquidity Conditions Expected In 2026 Interestingly, Bull Theory analysts assert that the crypto market’s recent decline is not indicative of a fundamental shift towards bearish conditions but rather an overreaction based on high expectations leading up to the Fed’s announcement. The Fed has now enacted rate cuts three times in as many meetings, and their plans to purchase $40 billion in T-bills over the next month are designed to inject liquidity into the markets. Moreover, Powell indicated that further rate hikes are not on the horizon as a base case, and forecasts for solid economic growth next year remain intact. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Neither In A Bull Nor Bear Market: Expert Explains The Setup Although job gains may have been overstated, suggesting a softer labor market, this could afford the Fed greater flexibility to ease monetary conditions in the future if necessary. The current market movements illustrate that the dumping of assets was largely driven by overly optimistic expectations rather than any deterioration in underlying fundamentals. Looking ahead, the analysts believe that next year is expected to be more favorable for Bitcoin and broader crypto prices in terms of liquidity, contrasting sharply with the conditions projected for 2025. Bitcoin recovered above $91,100 as of this writing, amid rising volatility. This puts the top cryptocurrency 26% behind its all-time high of $126,000, set in October of this year.

Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.1420 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a recovery wave, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1425 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.1440 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1440 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The next major resistance is near the $0.1490 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1530 swing high to the $0.1363 low. A close above the $0.1490 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1530 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1550 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1620. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1440 level, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1380 level. The next major support is near the $0.1360 level. The main support sits at $0.1320. If there is a downside break below the $0.1320 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.1250 level or even $0.1240 in the near term.

    "body": "A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how Stellar has just seen a TD Sequential buy signal. Here’s what happened the last time the pattern surfaced. Stellar Shot Up The Last Time A TD Buy Signal Appeared At Current Prices In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential signal that has appeared in the 1-week price of Stellar. The TD Sequential is a technical analysis (TA) indicator that’s used for pinpointing locations of probable reversal in an asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Lacks Fresh Momentum As Realized Cap Growth Still Declining The indicator involves two phases. In both of them, it works by counting up candles of the same polarity (that is, whether red or green) in the asset’s chart. These candles don’t have to be consecutive. During the first phase, called the setup, this count runs until nine candles of a color are in. Once the indicator finishes the setup, the price can be assumed to have reached a potential point of turnaround. Naturally, this signal is a bullish one if the candles leading up to the setup’s completion were red. On the other hand, it’s bearish in the case of nine green candles. As soon as the setup is over, the second phase, known as the countdown, kicks off. In this phase, the candle count runs until 13. After the countdown is over, the asset could be considered to have arrived at another reversal. The TD Sequential has just completed the former of the two phases for Stellar. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows this pattern forming in the weekly XLM price. As displayed in the graph, Stellar has formed the latest TD Sequential setup with nine red candles, implying that the downtrend may be reaching a state of exhaustion and a bullish reversal could be due for the asset. Interestingly, this isn’t the first time that XLM has shown a TD Sequential buy signal at the current price levels during the last few months. From the chart, it’s visible that this pattern also emerged when the cryptocurrency was trading at similar levels in March. That setup in the indicator eventually led to a price surge of 95% for Stellar. Given this trend, it’s possible that the latest signal could also prove to be bullish for XLM. Related Reading: Solana Enters Bear Territory: Realized Loss Now Outweighs Profit Something to note, however, is that the TD Sequential setup didn’t immediately lead into the big price rally back then; it took a while of consolidation before the breakout appeared. It now remains to be seen whether the indicator will hold for Stellar this time, and if so, how long a rally will take to appear. XLM Price At the time of writing, Stellar is trading around $0.243, down more than 4% over the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, charts from TradingView.com",

    "body": "XRP price started a fresh decline below $2.080. The price is now struggling and faces resistance near the $2.040 resistance level. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.050 zone. The price is now trading below $2.050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.040 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below $2.00. XRP Price Struggles Near Resistance XRP price attempted a recovery wave above $2.150 but failed to continue higher, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price started a fresh decline below $2.080 and $2.050. There was a move below the $2.00 support level. A low was formed at $1.993, and the price recently started an upside correction. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.177 swing high to the $1.993 low. However, the bears are active near $2.040 and $2.050. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.040 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.040 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.080 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.177 swing high to the $1.993 low. A close above $2.080 could send the price to $2.012. The next hurdle sits at $2.150. A clear move above the $2.150 resistance might send the price toward the $2.1850 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.220 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.250. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.040 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.00 level. The next major support is near the $1.9880 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.9880 level, the price might continue to decline toward $1.920. The next major support sits near the $1.880 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.820. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.00 and $1.9850. Major Resistance Levels – $2.040 and $2.080.",

    "body": "A recent report from BitcoinTreasuries.Net highlights significant challenges faced by Bitcoin-focused treasury companies since November. The findings revealed that the vast majority of these firms are now grappling with substantial unrealized losses, prompting many to sell off considerable amounts of their Bitcoin holdings. Market Struggles Continue In a sample analysis of 100 companies with reliable cost basis measurements, approximately 65% purchased Bitcoin at prices that now exceed the current market value, leaving a considerable number of these treasuries with substantial unrealized losses. Bitcoin’s market downturn in late November pushed spot prices down towards $90,000, leaving many buyers from 2025 at a financial disadvantage. Related Reading: Bitcoin Outlook Post Fed’s 0.25% Rate Cut: Historical Patterns And Predictions Now, the market’s leading crypto has retraced below this key level on Thursday, even despite the Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut announcement. Among the companies surveyed, about two-thirds are found to be sitting on unrealized losses based on current market values. But despite the volatility in pricing, some of the largest balance sheets continued to acquire Bitcoin. Notably, firms like Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) and Strive significantly contributed to net additions in November, with Strategy accounting for approximately 75% of all monthly purchases following their sell-offs. Mining companies remain steadfast as a cornerstone of public market Bitcoin holdings. In November, they represented about 5% of new additions to the market and around 12% of the total balances held by public companies. Bitcoin Demand Remains Strong Even as Bitcoin treasury stocks have shown softness compared to Bitcoin itself and broader equity benchmarks, many companies still pursued strategies to add BTC to their balance sheets while refining their capital-market approaches. BitcoinTreasury.Net’s analysis indicates that nearly 50 firms have managed to achieve gains of at least 10% over the last 6 to 12 months. Over time, losses have begun to soften for some. Currently, around 140 companies have experienced declines of at least 10% over a 1 to 3 month period, while about 105 companies have seen similar declines year-to-date. However, not all corporate holders opted to weather the storm of price fluctuations. In November alone, at least five companies decided to sell Bitcoin, with Sequans leading the charge by offloading roughly one-third of its holdings. Related Reading: Strategy Calls For Withdrawal Of MSCI’s Exclusion Plan For Digital Asset Treasury Companies Looking forward, the fourth quarter of 2025 is expected to close with about 40,000 BTC added to public company balance sheets. This figure is notably below the totals from each of the prior four quarters and aligns closely with the additions seen in the third quarter of 2024. The report concluded that despite a clear easing in the “summer buying frenzy,” demand for Bitcoin has not entirely diminished as public corporations are adapting to a more cautious and selective approach as they reassess their recent purchases. At the time of writing, BTC traded at $89,920, down over 2% in the previous 24 hours. This places the cryptocurrency 27% behind its all-time high of $126,000 set in October of this year.

    "title": "Zcash (ZEC) Approaches Critical Breakout Zone With Bulls Targeting Higher Levels After Recent Surge",
    "body": "Zcash’s latest price movement has pushed the privacy-focused cryptocurrency back into the spotlight, as momentum builds around a potential breakout from a long-standing resistance zone. Related Reading: What’s Happening With The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Recently? After a sharp climb this week, traders are watching whether ZEC can extend its gains or whether technical pressures will stall the advance. The token surged more than 9% to reach around $455, standing out in a broader market that has mostly moved sideways despite renewed optimism following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest policy signals. Rising demand, shifting fee structures, and notable whale activity have all contributed to ZEC’s strong performance, but the technical picture remains mixed as the asset approaches a critical threshold. ZEC's price shows bullish momentum on the daily chart. Source: ZECUSD on Tradingview Dynamic Fee Proposal and Whale Demand Lift ZEC Zcash’s rally coincides with a key development effort from its contributors. Developers and Shielded Labs proposed transitioning from fixed transaction fees to a dynamic fee market, a change aimed at improving cost efficiency during periods of high activity. Market activity also intensified. Trading volumes rose sharply, and Cypherpunk Technologies expanded its ZEC holdings while adding Zcash founder Zooko Wilcox as an advisor. On-chain data indicated accumulation from large holders, including a wallet that increased its position and sent tokens to Hyperliquid to establish a long exposure. Such behavior has tightened the circulating supply at a moment when ZEC is testing historical resistance. Zcash’s broader performance this year further adds to the current market narrative. The token has posted returns exceeding 600% over the past 12 months, helped by rising investor interest in privacy assets and a constrained supply profile. ZEC Tests Multi-Touch Resistance as Bulls Aim for Continuation Despite the strong surge, Zcash now sits near a resistance zone, roughly between $460 and $485, that has repeatedly halted rallies in previous cycles. Technical readings show improving momentum on lower timeframes, supported by stable RSI levels and a constructive parabolic SAR structure. Spot inflow data has also flipped positive, suggesting buyers are re-entering rather than exiting on strength. If ZEC breaks above the $472–$485 range, analysts note potential upside targets at $506, $556, and possibly even $600–$620. Clearing this region would mark a shift from the most recent lower-high pattern and could accelerate trend continuation. Mixed Long-Term Outlook as New Cycle Signals Emerge However, some longer-term indicators raise caution. Wave analysis from multiple chart views suggests ZEC may have completed a major corrective structure earlier in the cycle, followed by a 60% decline and a weaker recovery. Bearish divergences in momentum tools and a rising parallel channel on shorter timeframes hint that the current bounce could still be corrective. A rejection at the resistance level may lead to a retracement toward $430, followed by the $370–$398 zone. A deeper breakdown could push prices below $300 if bearish structures reassert themselves.

A decisive move above resistance could extend the recent surge, but failure to break through may shift momentum back toward consolidation, or even a broader downtrend.
