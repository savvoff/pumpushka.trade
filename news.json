    "title": "Analyst Predicts 10x Rally For XRP Price If THis Trend Repeats",
    "body": "Crypto analyst ChartNerd has predicted that the XRP price could rally 10x if a specific trend repeats. The analyst also revealed what needs to happen for the altcoin to invalidate this potential parabolic rally. XRP Price Could Rally 10x If This 2017 Pattern Plays Out In an X post, ChartNerd predicted that the XRP price could rally 1,000% if a bullish pattern from the 2017 bull cycle plays out. The analyst noted that during the 2017 euphoric run, the altcoin had a 3-month cool-off period where it successfully dropped towards its 3-month 20-EMA for a retest before a 25x move to the upside. Related Reading: Analyst Says Get Ready For XRP Price Above $4 This Cycle ChartNerd revealed that the XRP price has now witnessed the exact same set-up in this 2025 bull cycle. The altcoin recorded a huge breakout last year and is now seeing a 3-month cool-off period towards a 3-month 20-EMA retest. The analyst stated that if history is set to repeat, XRP could see a 10x upside move, signaling a blow-off top. The analyst also alluded to the 2021 lower high, which he noted ties up with both the monthly candle close highs from 2017 and also the SEC lawsuit, which is believed to have suppressed the XRP price during the 2021 cycle. ChartNerd added that to invalidate this potential rally, XRP will need to close below its 3-month 20-EMA at $1.20. Until then, he noted that the bulls remain in control. Meanwhile, ChartNerd outlined $8, $13, and $27 as the potential top-out points for the XRP price. Notably, a rally to any of these price targets will mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the altcoin. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto had also previously predicted that XRP could reach $27 in this bull run if it mirrors the 2017 price action. XRP Could Be The Next Crypto To Record A Major Run Market commentator Milk Road suggested in an X post that the XRP price could soon record a major run. The platform cited bullish fundamentals for the altcoin, including the fact that RLUSD crossed $1 billion in market cap in record time. The run to this milestone is said to be faster than almost any stablecoin Ripple has ever pushed. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Hit $100 Before Bitcoin Hits $1 Million Furthermore, Milk Road noted that Abu Dhabi’s ADGM has opened the door for institutions to use RLUSD as real collateral, which is also bullish for the XRP price. The market commentator stated that global liquidity with regulated on-ramps could mean the kind of flows that crypto hasn’t seen in months. It is also worth noting that XRP is seeing significant flows into its ecosystem through the U.S. spot ETFs. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.18, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Analyst Sets Bitcoin Next Target At $95k-$96k – Here’s Why",
    "body": "The Bitcoin market experienced a moderate price rebound over the past week, following a prolonged period of price correction that began in early October. The flagship cryptocurrency is now trading above $90,000, with hopes building for a potential push back toward its all-time high of $126,100. Notably, popular market analyst KillaXBT has flagged a key price zone that could serve as the next target in this relieving market recovery. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Break Key Supply Clusters To Regain ATH Momentum – Watch These Levels Bitcoin Headed To $95k-$96k, But Price Pullback May Occur First – Analyst In an X post on November 28, KillaXBT shares some compelling insights on Bitcoin’s price condition, highlighting both bullish and bearish tendencies. Following the asset’s gain of 7.22% in the past week, the analyst predicts that market bulls are likely to drive prices to around $95,000-$96,000, which contains strong, heavy illiquidity pockets and several liquidation clusters. For context, these zones are attractive to price because they contain large concentrations of resting orders, making them high-value liquidity targets. Liquidation clusters, in particular, hold groups of leveraged positions that trigger forced buying or selling once the price reaches them, injecting fresh liquidity into the market. However, KillaXBT cautions that this upside move may not occur immediately, noting that the market often delays sweeping major liquidity zones ahead of key macro events. With the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting expected to deliver clarity on potential rate cuts, traders may see continued liquidity building below the yearly open in the near term. According to the analyst, these upper liquidation levels are still likely to be cleared, but the timing could align more closely with next month’s policy announcement rather than the current market cycle. The analyst outlines a potential scenario in which Bitcoin experiences a minor pullback to around $93,000 before retesting $89,200. From there, the asset could move toward the $95,000–$96,000 target, in line with expectations for a potential FOMC rate adjustment. However, KillaXBT also highlights the possibility that Bitcoin may reach these key liquidation zones before the FOMC meeting. In such a scenario, the market could see a rapid surge to $96,000, followed by a sharp drop to around $89,200 due to potential liquidations, before eventually returning to these upper liquidity zones. Following this analysis, KillaXBT is opting for a short position, which he intends to reassess in relation to market trends as the FOMC approaches. Interestingly, the analyst believes the real short-term opportunity only comes after the FOMC’s announcement. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Loss Transfers Fall 80% From Peak – What Comes Next?
