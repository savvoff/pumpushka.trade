    "title": "‘Saylor Is Finished’ – Peter Schiff Slams Bitcoin Tycoon Over $1.44B Reserve Build-Up",
    "body": "Strategy Inc., the firm once best known as MicroStrategy, said Monday it has raised cash and set aside a $1.44 billion US reserve to cover near-term obligations as Bitcoin tumbles. The move came after recent share sales and follows a brief buy of new coins, according to company statements and market reports. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Face A Harsh December: Rising BTC Difficulty, Falling Hashprice Strategy Establishes $1.44B Cash Reserve According to filings and market reports, the reserve was funded by selling Class A common stock under an at-the-market program and is meant to fund dividends on Strategy’s preferred shares and to help pay interest on its debt for at least 12 months, with a target to extend cover to 24 months or more. The company said it did not liquidate its Bitcoin stash to create the reserve. The size of the company’s Bitcoin holdings remains unusually large. Based on reports, Strategy now holds about 650,000 BTC after a small recent purchase of roughly 130 BTC that cost about $11.7 million. That hoard is still worth tens of billions of dollars at current prices, but price swings have put fresh pressure on a business built around holding the asset. Strategy Inc. announced a $1.44 billion USD reserve to cover at least 12 months of preferred dividends and interest payments, funded through its at-the-market stock sales. The company now holds 650,000 BTC and says the reserve will help manage volatility. https://t.co/i4X1J62Qel — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 1, 2025 Bitcoin: Market Reaction And Risks Investors reacted quickly. Strategy’s shares have fallen sharply this year, and analysts say the new cash buffer may calm some fears but won’t erase larger funding and debt timelines that loom over the company. Strategy announces $1.44B USD Reserve and now hodls 650,000 $BTC. pic.twitter.com/FNFivMNQgh — Strategy (@Strategy) December 1, 2025 Reports put convertible debt tied to past financing at about $8 billion, and company metrics show the market-to-Bitcoin ratio (mNAV) sliding closer to levels where management has said it might consider selling coins only as a last resort. Peter Schiff, a well-known Bitcoin critic, took to social media after the announcement and described the reserve as proof the model has failed, calling Michael Saylor a “conman” and saying Saylor is “finished.” Today is the beginning of the end of $MSTR. Saylor was forced to sell stock not to buy Bitcoin, but to buy U.S. dollars merely to fund MSTR’s interest and dividend obligations. The stock is broken. The business model is a fraud, and @Saylor is the biggest con man on Wall Street. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 1, 2025 Other market voices urged caution, saying the move changes how investors should value the company — from a pure Bitcoin treasury play to an entity with ongoing cash obligations. According to reports, Strategy also cut its 2025 profit and Bitcoin-linked yield targets after recent price moves, a sign that management is dealing with a less bullish near-term outlook than it expected earlier this year. The reserve is meant to prevent forced sales of Bitcoin to meet fixed payouts, but holding cash has its own costs and raises governance questions among long-time backers. Related Reading: XRP Is About To Hit A Major Turning Point This Week, Analyst Says Schiff’s Issue With Saylor Schiff’s blistering attack — calling Saylor a fraud and declaring him done — adds a sharp political edge to what had been framed as a financial maneuver. His claims amplify worries among some investors about Strategy’s governance and capital plan, even as others dismiss the remarks as partisan rhetoric. Ultimately, whether Schiff’s accusations stick will depend less on social-media barbs than on Strategy’s next moves around debt, disclosure and any future coin sales — actions that will tell investors whether Saylor’s stewardship can weather this storm.

    "title": "Best Crypto to Buy Now: $HYPER Supercharges Bitcoin Layer-2",
    "body": "What to Know: Bitcoin’s base layer still struggles with slow transaction times, high fees, and limited programmability, creating a clear gap for scalable infrastructure. As Bitcoin rallies, traders increasingly look for high-beta infrastructure plays tied directly to $BTC’s success rather than disconnected altcoin narratives. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) introduces the first Bitcoin Layer 2 with SVM integration, aiming to deliver Solana-level performance while anchoring value to Bitcoin security. With SVM-based smart contracts and low-latency execution, Bitcoin Hyper targets wrapped BTC payments, DeFi, NFTs, and gaming as core utility drivers. Bitcoin’s rallies make one thing brutally clear: the base layer is still terrible for everyday usage. When fees spike above $20 and confirmation times stretch, the world’s largest network turns into a settlement chain, not a place for fast payments, DeFi, or gaming. That creates a massive opening. Traders hunting the best crypto to buy ahead of the next Bitcoin wave increasingly look beyond random alt narratives. The real upside, many argue, lies in infrastructure that can scale Bitcoin itself, letting you bet on throughput and programmability without abandoning $BTC as the core asset. That’s the lane Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is targeting: a Bitcoin Layer 2 that bolts Solana-style speed onto Bitcoin’s security. Instead of pitching yet another speculative ecosystem, it offers a direct wager on solving Bitcoin’s oldest pain points – slow transactions, high fees, and limited smart contract functionality. The presale is already underway, so if you want to know ‘ How to Buy Bitcoin Hyper ’, we’ve got you covered. With growing interest from traders and builders, Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as a high-beta, infrastructure-focused play on the next major Bitcoin cycle, rather than a passing narrative trade. Bitcoin Hyper Turns Bitcoin Into a High-Speed Smart Contract Hub Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) delivers a simple promise for users: keep Bitcoin’s security, gain Solana-like performance. It uses Solana Virtual Machine technology to power a Bitcoin Layer 2, aiming for sub-second confirmation times and low-cost transactions. This means you can move wrapped $BTC through dApps without watching gas eat your margin. For everyday users, that means high-speed payments in wrapped $BTC, on-chain swaps, lending, staking, NFTs, and gaming that actually feel responsive. Developers get an SVM environment with Rust-based tooling and APIs, opening up Solana-style UX while still settling value back to Bitcoin’s battle-tested base layer. Unlike older Bitcoin scaling stacks that lean on slower virtual machines or clunky sidechain UX, Bitcoin Hyper explicitly targets Solana-level throughput and latency. If you want a deeper breakdown, check out our ‘ What is Bitcoin Hyper ’ guide for all the details. Buy $HYPER today for $0.013365 and take advantage of 40% staking rewards. Can $HYPER Ride The Next Bitcoin Cycle? Our experts predict that $HYPER could hit $0.08625 by the end of 2026. If you invested at today’s price, you’re looking at a potential ROI of over 545%. Momentum indicators are already emerging. Smart money is moving. High-net-worth wallets have bought in bulk across the presale, with the two largest buys being $500K and $379.9K . Early whale interest often acts as a signal that some capital is quietly positioning around a new infrastructure narrative before headlines catch up. From here, the bet is straightforward: if Bitcoin Hyper becomes a go-to venue for $BTC-based DeFi, payments, and gaming dApps, the network effect can compound quickly. As more developers ship SVM-based apps anchored to Bitcoin, demand for blockspace and governance exposure flows back into the token. The presale has already raised over $28.8M, showing massive backing and support. Bitcoin Hyper frames itself as a way to front-run the next big Bitcoin story: not ‘digital gold’ this time, but programmable, high-speed Bitcoin. If its SVM-powered Layer 2 gains traction with builders and liquidity, $HYPER could offer one of the cleaner, infrastructure-first ways to express a bullish thesis on Bitcoin scalability. If you’re looking for exposure beyond spot $BTC, but still want your thesis rooted in Bitcoin rather than a random theme coin, Bitcoin Hyper presents a more targeted bet. As always, size positions responsibly, but keep an eye on how quickly users, dApps, and liquidity start to populate this emerging Layer-2. Join the $HYPER presale today. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

    "title": "Next 1000x Crypto to Buy After Bitcoin’s November Stress Test",
    "body": "What to Know: Bitcoin’s November selloff showed that DeFi and core crypto infrastructure are tougher than they look, boosting the case for real utility 1000x plays. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) brings SVM execution and ultra low latency smart contracts to Bitcoin, aiming for high speed wrapped $BTC DeFi on a modular Layer 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) reshapes meme coins with a mine to earn virtual node system that rewards engagement instead of blind speculation. Cardano ($ADA) keeps building as a research driven base layer, supported by Hydra scaling and new exposure through the Brave wallet. Bitcoin’s November crash looked painful on the charts. Prices swung double digits in days, and every social media chart wizard acted like the sky was falling. But under the surface, something more interesting happened. DeFi infrastructure held. Trades cleared. Liquidations worked. Yield strategies kept running. There were no chain meltdowns or domino style collapses like in previous cycles. It was boring in the best possible way. That resilience matters. It shows that capital is finally shifting to systems that actually work during volatility. Not the hype coins that vanish after one bad weekend, but the rails that keep the market running when the heat turns up. If you think the next 1000x crypto to buy is the project that survives these stress tests, then you’re already looking past the usual noise. You want speed, strong security assumptions, and tech stacks that do not explode the moment gas fees spike. Below are three new crypto projects that match that idea. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) as a bold Bitcoin Layer 2 execution engine. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) as a mine to earn twist on memecoins. And Cardano ($ADA) as the slow and steady research chain that keeps shipping L2 capacity. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – First Bitcoin L2 With SVM Execution Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) calls itself the first Bitcoin Layer 2 that runs the Solana Virtual Machine. In simple terms, it tries to bolt Solana level performance onto Bitcoin’s settlement layer. Bitcoin keeps its security. $HYPER provides the speed. Instead of waiting for Bitcoin’s ~10 minute blocks and dealing with its limited scripting, $HYPER sends execution to a real time SVM Layer 2. The setup is modular: Bitcoin L1 for settlement, one trusted sequencer for ordering, and an SVM execution layer that targets sub second confirmations and very low fees. It gives DeFi on Bitcoin a Solana style user experience. Bitcoin Hyper wants wrapped $BTC to feel like a real DeFi asset. Fast payments. Tiny fees. Swaps, lending, and staking inside SVM contracts. Even NFTs and gaming rails through Rust based SDKs. SPL compatible tokens make it easy for Solana builders to join the ecosystem. The market seems to like the idea. The presale has already raised over $28M, and you can buy $HYPER now for just $0.013365. Staking begins right after TGE, and presale stakers get a 7 day vesting window. It’s set up for long term participation instead of quick flips. If you think Bitcoin’s next big move comes from fast, programmable liquidity built on Bitcoin instead of moving away from it, Bitcoin Hyper is a strong high beta bet on that future. For more context on this project, check out Bitcoin Hyper price prediction and see what the future holds. Join the $HYPER presale now. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Mine‑to‑Earn Memecoin With Node Economics November reminded everyone that most meme coins still trade like lottery tickets taped to a roller coaster. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) wants to change that with a mine to earn model that rewards users for running virtual nodes and being active, not just watching charts. The core of the system is a virtual mining setup with tiered node rewards. Engagement produces tokens and higher tier nodes lead to better performance. Users track progress through a dashboard that looks more like a simple DeFi mining UI than a standard meme page. For a project still in presale, traction is strong. $PEPENODE has raised over $2M so far, with tokens priced at $0.0011731. The official staking program offers 578% APY, while the node reward system works as a soft yield tool, sending new supply toward active community members instead of random speculators. Most meme coins depend on hype loops, influencers, and luck. PEPENODE brings back a touch of early DeFi mining energy. It’s gamified, but with actual rules and transparent dashboards. If you want meme upside without wandering around blindfolded, this one deserves a spot on your radar. To dive deeper into the project, you can also check out PEPENODE price prediction and see how 2026 looks like for this memecoin. Join the PEPENODE presale. 3. Cardano ($ADA) – Research‑Driven Base Layer With Hydra Scaling Bitcoin Hyper tries to improve Bitcoin from the outside. Cardano ($ADA) does the opposite. It builds its base layer slowly and scientifically, with formal methods and a layered design. Its Ouroboros proof of stake system aims for proof of work level security while staying energy efficient. Cardano separates settlement and computation. This lets developers create more complex smart contracts without overloading the base chain. Hydra adds Layer 2 scaling on top, letting apps run high throughput activity off chain and anchor back to the mainnet when needed. The ecosystem has been expanding in the background. Brave wallet integration now gives $ADA exposure to more than 85M users. This brings a steady flow of potential new holders and dApp users into the Cardano world. At the same time, institutions continue exploring DeFi, identity, and real world asset ideas on Cardano. $ADA is currently trading around $0.3934, giving the network a relatively steady valuation as development keeps moving. Cardano isn’t the loudest chain. It doesn’t shout about transactions per second every week. But its mix of formal verification, Hydra scaling, and massive user distribution makes it one of the more durable large cap platforms. If your thesis favors slow cooking infrastructure that wins long term, ADA still belongs in the conversation. Buy Cardano from Binance now. Bitcoin’s November dip was more than a price correction. It was a live stress test. And the winners were the projects that kept working while everything else shook. Recap: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) pushes fast DeFi execution on Bitcoin. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) upgrades memes with node based rewards. Cardano ($ADA) keeps compounding with research driven tech and new scaling layers. If Bitcoin’s future growth comes from tools that keep running during chaos, these three offer very different but very real ways to position early.

    "title": "Brace For Impact: XRP Price Has Formed A Bullish Cross On Its Weekly Stochastic RSI",
    "body": "XRP price has formed a bullish cross on its weekly Stochastic RSI, creating a bullish sign for the cryptocurrency at a time when its price has been struggling to break away from the $2 region. The cryptocurrency has spent the past several days moving into a downturn, and buyers will now be looking to defend $2. Even though momentum has been limited, new inflows from recently launched XRP ETFs have kept sentiment from turning full-on bearish. XRP Stochastic RSI Undergoes Bullish Weekly Cross According to crypto analyst ChartNerd, XRP has just printed a bullish cross on its weekly Stochastic RSI while still sitting deep in oversold territory. The chart he shared highlights how the blue %K line has curved upward and crossed above the orange %D line at one of the lowest points of the cycle. Related Reading: Analyst Says Get Ready For XRP Price Above $4 This Cycle With this move, the indicator has now repeated a structure that previously marked major turning points during XRP’s past market swings. Oversold weekly conditions paired with a confirmed cross are useful in predicting the early stages of trend reversals, especially when they occur after extended downside momentum. ChartNerd pointed out that this same configuration appeared twice recently, first in 2024 and again in 2025, and both instances produced powerful rallies. The 2024 cross preceded a surge of more than 600%, at which point the XRP price went from trading around $0.5 to trading above $3. The mid-2025 cross delivered a smaller yet still significant 130% run, at which point the XRP price went from hovering around $2.1 to breaking new all-time highs above $3.6 in July. As shown in the chart below, these earlier crosses are marked at similar low points, forming a repeating rhythm of sharp recoveries whenever the weekly Stochastic RSI resets and turns up. The current setup is in the same zone, and this opens up speculation that XRP’s price action may be forming the base of its next major upward leg. Is Another Major XRP Pump Approaching? Although past performance does not dictate what happens next, the indicator’s consistency on the weekly timeframe is difficult to ignore. XRP’s price is again positioned inside a compressed region just as it was before its previous large rallies. This time, the price zone to take note of is around $2. Related Reading: What The Rapid XRP Outlfows From Crypto Exchanges Mean For The Price If buyers regain strength and the wider crypto market conditions improve, most notably Bitcoin climbing back above $100,000, then the probability of a stronger XRP reaction increases. The only thing going well right now for XRP is the inflows into US-based Spot XRP ETFs, with $89.65 million worth of new institutional funds coming in on December 1. A rally similar to the 130% rebound seen during the previous cycle would lift XRP from $2 to about $4.60. A repeat of the much larger 600% surge would place the token above $14. This creates a potential range between $4.60 and $14 if the pattern repeats itself. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "XRP Price Prediction: Surge to 1M Payments Fuels Attention on SUBBD Token",
    "body": "What to Know: Over 1M XRP payments in a single day show how strong on-chain activity can grow even when the token price moves sideways. Markets are shifting toward crypto assets that support clear, repeatable real-world actions – payments, gaming, and creator monetization – instead of pure hype. AI creator platforms keep running into the same problems: huge fees, random bans, clunky tools, and payments that change depending on your passport. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) mixes Web3 payouts, token-gated content, and AI tools to cut fees for creators and give fans programmable ways to access and support content. More than 1M XRP payments between unique wallets in a single day is the kind of number that slices through all the market noise. Prices can wander. Sentiment can swing like a kid on too much sugar. But real on-chain usage shows where actual product-market fit is forming under the surface. This jump in activity shows something very simple: when a network handles payments at scale without breaking a sweat, people use it. XRP has spent years proving it can move money fast and cheap for cross-border payments, even while its price deals with macro pressure and regulatory drama. And now, the same filter is starting to shape the rest of the crypto market. Capital is moving away from ‘vibes first, utility later’ tokens toward projects with obvious, repeatable on-chain actions. Payments, gaming, real-world assets, and especially creator monetization are where users are actually clicking buttons instead of just tweeting memes. That’s the setup for SUBBD Token ($SUBBD), an AI-powered, Ethereum-based content platform token. As networks like XRP show how to move value at scale, projects like $SUBBD are trying to give that value a destination: tokenized content, AI creators, and programmable fan worlds. Why Payments-Scale Activity Is Repricing Utility Narratives 1M daily XRP payments between unique wallets highlight how fast real demand can settle on a chain once latency, fees, and reliability are solved. For builders, the lesson is almost boring in its simplicity: keep finality close to real-time and fees next to zero, and users will show up, even when the macro backdrop looks gloomy. The same pattern is showing up in the creator economy. Web2 platforms often take 30%-50% of earnings once you add up fees, revenue splits, and the joy of unpredictable algorithms. Creators get reach, but they lose control of their money and sometimes even their accounts. A random ban can shut down income overnight. It’s like building a business on quicksand. AI creator platforms are rising to fight this. Some Web3 projects offer token-gated content and NFT drops. Pure AI startups deliver fancy creation tools but keep payments centralized. The SUBBD platform aims to be the middle option: a hybrid that believes creator earnings, AI productivity, and on-chain payments belong together, not scattered across five apps and two spreadsheets. How SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) Turns AI, Web3 and Fans Into One Revenue Engine Most platforms tape crypto or AI on top like an afterthought, but the SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) sits at the center of everything this platform does. SUBBD is a new crypto project designed in a way that AI tools, creator features, and on-chain payouts all flow through the token instead of being bolted on later. On the infrastructure side, the SUBBD platform uses Ethereum-compatible smart contracts that power tokenized access, staking, and governance. On the AI side, creators get tools for content generation, chatbots, voice cloning, and object recognition, which help them work faster without losing their minds. The main problem $SUBBD tackles is simple and painful: creators losing up to 70% of their income to platforms, payment processors, and every middleman who wants a slice. Add the constant fear of bans or demonetization, and the whole thing becomes a stressful business model. SUBBD solves this by routing earnings through the $SUBBD token, giving creators crypto payouts, global reach without banking friction, and token-gated exclusives they fully control. Experience is where SUBBD tries to stand out. The AI Personal Assistant handles automated DMs, fan chats, and custom replies. AI voice cloning and AI influencer creation let creators experiment with new personas and new languages without hiring extra help. Fans, meanwhile, receive subscriptions, access to exclusive content, pay-per-view drops, NFT sales, tipping, and even AI-only experiences in one place. In other words, it’s a win-win for both creators and their fans. Why $SUBBD Matters Right Now The SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) design tries to keep users engaged. The presale has already raised $1.3M+, which signals early demand for a creator-focused token instead of just another meme coin. Right now, you can buy $SUBBD for just $0.0571. ➡️ Check out our guide to buying $SUBBD if you plan to join the presale. A fixed 20% APY staking rate in year one rewards early holders with exclusive livestreams, in-house content, daily behind-the-scenes drops, and XP boosts for future perks. To explore more possible upside scenarios and market positions, take a look at our SUBBD price prediction and compare it with your own view before deciding whether to invest in SUBBD Token. On-chain, holders can vote on new features, creator onboarding, themes, events, and which AI creators get highlighted. This governance layer pushes SUBBD closer to a programmable content marketplace rather than a static subscription site. As more value flows through high-throughput networks, the bet is that creator tokens like $SUBBD become one of the main places that value wants to land. 🚀 Join the $SUBBD presale before the next price increase.

    "title": "Ripple Marks Another Milestone In Bid To Dominate Global Payments With XRP",
    "body": "On December 1, 2025, Ripple announced a major regulatory upgrade in Singapore, reinforcing its ambition to make XRP a central instrument for global payments. The expanded license allows the company to streamline cross-border money transfers, expand its payments infrastructure, and provide faster, more transparent settlements to financial institutions worldwide. Ripple Intensifies Its Global Payments Playbook The Singapore regulatory upgrade extends the scope of Ripple’s Major Payment Institution (MPI) license, giving its subsidiary, Ripple Markets APAC Pte. Ltd., authority to operate a fully regulated, end-to-end payments platform. The license enables Ripple to handle fund collection, secure custody, token conversion, and final payouts within a single operational framework. XRP and Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD are embedded into the system, consolidating complex cross-border processes into a fast, compliant, and transparent environment. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Price Crash To $41,000: There’s A Shark In The Water This upgrade positions Ripple as a turnkey solution for banks, corporates, and fintechs. By managing both regulatory compliance and the technology infrastructure, Ripple removes the fragmentation that slows legacy systems. These institutions now have a single point of contact, reducing complexity and making operations more efficient. Ripple is also expanding its geographic reach through strategic partnerships. Its collaboration with Bahrain Fintech Bay allows the company to run pilot programs, real-world payment trials, and early deployment of token-driven services in the Gulf region. These initiatives help Ripple establish liquidity corridors, embed its infrastructure into local financial ecosystems, and build familiarity with regional regulators. Financially, Ripple strengthened its position with a $500 million funding round in November 2025, which valued the company at roughly $40 billion. The capital is being directed toward scaling payment infrastructure, enhancing enterprise tools, and expanding its stablecoin program. With these resources, Ripple can roll out its technology faster, integrate with new partners more efficiently, and advance its dominance in the institutional payments market. XRP’s Expanding Utility In Ripple’s Global Framework XRP remains the settlement engine of Ripple’s infrastructure, providing instant liquidity, rapid transaction settlement, and multi-currency interoperability. This functionality allows Ripple to address high-friction payment corridors, such as those in Africa, where it works with regional providers to replace slow correspondent banking chains with XRP-enabled settlements. In the Asia-Pacific region, growing on-chain activity and rising institutional demand create favorable conditions for token-based cross-border payments. The Singapore MPI upgrade now offers a regulated launchpad to deliver XRP-powered rails across these high-growth regions. Related Reading: Pundit Shares XRP Fact That Will ‘Blow Your Mind’ Building on this foundation, Ripple is creating a vertically integrated ecosystem where fiat, stablecoins, and digital assets operate through a unified platform. Within this framework, XRP bridges currencies, provides deep liquidity, and executes transactions faster than traditional systems. Each regulatory approval, partnership, and infrastructure deployment further embeds XRP into the backbone of global financial infrastructure. Together, these milestones illustrate Ripple’s multi-market strategy: expanding regulatory clarity, deploying robust infrastructure, and demonstrating real-world XRP utility. The Singapore upgrade is a decisive step in this progression, reinforcing Ripple’s steady movement toward making XRP a central tool for cross-border payment systems.

    "title": "XRP Price About $1,000 Is A Necessity, Analyst Claims",
    "body": "A recent XRP price analysis from a prominent supporter has placed the cryptocurrency’s long-term value in the four-figure range. Although XRP is currently trading around $2, the analyst believes a rise to $1,000 is necessary for the altcoin. His outlook stems from the cryptocurrency’s underlying utility rather than speculation, emphasizing how global liquidity systems could drive prices upward through massive settlement volumes. Why The XRP Price Needs To Climb To $1,000 Crypto analyst @unkownDLT has shared a rather ambitious price forecast for XRP this week. The analyst claims that the cryptocurrency must reach thousands of dollars to operate as a fundamental component within global settlement and collateral markets. He highlights that this bold target is not mere speculative hype but a projection of what could unfold if XRP were to serve as the backbone of global liquidity flows. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 10x Rally For XRP Price If THis Trend Repeats @unkownDLT argues that capturing even a small share of about 5-10% of the global value transfer market would require the cryptocurrency to be worth at least $1,000 to operate efficiently. From this viewpoint, XRP’s high potential value is a necessity. Typically, trillions of dollars move across borders through banks, clearing houses, and collateral markets each day. The analyst suggests that if XRP were to serve as a bridge asset for major institutions and cross-border payment systems, its price would need to be high enough to prevent the blockchain network from running out of usable supply. In essence, a higher valuation would allow the network to handle larger transaction volumes without requiring enormous amounts of XRP for every transfer. @unkownDLT explained that a low-value asset cannot serve as an effective settlement buffer for global finance. On the other hand, a higher-value token would provide more usable liquidity and offer greater stability and lower volatility. Since its inception, XRP has had a fixed number of units, so a rise in its price is one of the few ways to scale its capacity to handle trillions of dollars in daily global inflows. XRP’s Price Discovery And True Value In a separate post, @unkownDLT revealed that XRP has yet to experience a price discovery. Currently, the cryptocurrency is in a downtrend and has consistently failed to reclaim previous highs. The analyst has set XRP’s price discovery target above $3.4, representing a 69% increase from its current price of around $2.00. He says that technical patterns do not drive this bullish target, but the emergence of new market conditions. Related Reading: The Bull And Bear Scenario For XRP That Could Play Out In November According to @unkownDLT, XRP has never traded in an environment shaped by institutional inflows, regulatory clarity, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), or a global shift toward distributed ledger infrastructure. With these elements converging, he believes the next cycle will behave differently from past market cycles. The analyst has also highlighted that XRP’s true value becomes visible only when institutions require a neutral asset to settle tokenized value across interconnected networks. He described the cryptocurrency as a universal clearing layer that bridges settlement environments and enables seamless movement across digital financial systems.

Related Reading: $300 Million Crypto Bet: Kazakhstan’s Central Bank Gears Up On-chain investigators traced a clear path of funds, and community members say the clues are strong enough to support an official probe. Still, exchanges are holding back unless a police case number is presented. On-Chain Trail Revealed Based on reports from on-chain sleuths, the attacker moved 260 Ether through Tornado Cash before routing 232.49 ETH to deposit addresses at KuCoin. The laundering path involved 111 wallets and 45 unique KuCoin deposits, according to a public breakdown by a community investigator known as Shima. Shibarium Bridge hacker foolishly chose not to accept the K9 bounty – it’s finally time to share the investigation we’ve been working on…🔎 this is juicy 🤤 The hacker made one stupid mistake and it completely unravelled their Tornado Cash laundering. 💰🌪️💵 That one mistake… pic.twitter.com/itxsXbbGSm — Shima 島。 (@MRShimamoto) December 1, 2025 A small mistake — a single transfer of 0.0874 ETH — linked otherwise hidden wallets and allowed the investigator to map much of the operation. The tracing work was shared with the Shiba Inu ecosystem team so it could be used to press for recovery. Why didn’t https://t.co/OoTvg1kraL call the police? Why isn’t there a report to the appropriate authorities to get a case number? Why have no law enforcement been involved in the https://t.co/OoTvg1kraL bridge hack? https://t.co/88Gdxi0rhh — Pulse Digital 🟣 (@CryptoPulse9) December 1, 2025 Practical Roadblocks To Recovery Tracing crypto through mixers remains difficult, even when the ledger gives clues. Exchanges often need subpoena power, legal requests or a case number to share account details. That requirement can leave strong on-chain leads stuck if a project does not file a police report. Community investigators can point the way, but many of the next steps depend on formal legal action and cross-border cooperation. Exchange Action Hinges On Case Number After Shima handed the findings to the project team, members of the community and teams such as K9 Finance stepped in. One representative, using the handle DeFi Turtle, reached out to KuCoin to ask that the exchange freeze the suspected funds. KuCoin replied that it would require a formal law enforcement case number before taking such action, based on the messages that have circulated in community channels. Without a police report, the exchange said it could not legally provide internal records or lock the linked accounts. Sleuth Offers Evidence To Victims Faced with slow institutional movement, Shima has offered the full dataset, the mapping work and the methodology to victims and to any law enforcement body willing to act. Victims in different countries may need to lodge complaints locally to create the case numbers that exchanges demand. Related Reading: XRP Is About To Hit A Major Turning Point This Week, Analyst Says Calls For Formal Complaints Shane Cook, founder of Pulse Digital Marketing, questioned why the Shiba Inu team had not filed an official complaint despite the on-chain evidence. Reports show the team previously confirmed the breach and said it had contacted security firms including PeckShield and Hexens. Cook’s criticism centers on the idea that technical analysis alone may not be enough; a legal filing is often required to make exchanges cooperate. The community now wonders whether the project prioritized reopening the bridge and repayment planning over pursuing legal routes. Featured image from Hacked.com, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "Bitocin treasury companies continue to accumulate a significant amount of BTC despite current market conditions and now control around 5% of the total BTC supply. These companies are led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Metaplanet, which have recently raised fresh capital to buy the dip. Bitcoin Treasury Companies Now Hold Over 1 Million In BTC Bitcoin Treasuries data shows that the top 100 public Bitcoin treasury companies currently hold 1,058,929 BTC, while all public companies combined hold 1,061,697. Notably, Strategy is the largest public Bitcoin holder with 650,000 BTC. Michael Saylor’s company yesterday announced another 130 BTC purchase for $11.7 million. Related Reading: Strategy’s Crash Rumors Intensify, CEO Reveals When $46 Billion In Bitcoin Will Be Sold Meanwhile, the second-largest Bitcoin treasury company is BTC miner MARA holdings, which holds 53,250 BTC. Tether-backed Twenty One Capital, Metaplanet, and Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company complete the top 5, with 43,514, 30,823, and 30,021 BTC, respectively. Meanwhile, companies like Coinbase, Bullish, and Trump Media are among the top 10 largest BTC treasury companies. It is worth noting that these public companies account for only a part of the Bitcoin treasuries. Further data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that there is currently 4 million BTC in treasuries as a whole, including the coins held by governments, private companies, exchanges, DeFi platforms, and ETFs. BlackRock is currently the second-largest Bitcoin holder, only behind Satoshi Nakamoto. Strategy is third on the list, while Binance and the U.S. government complete the top 5, with BTC holdings of 628,868 and 323,588, respectively. The 4 million BTC held by these treasury companies as a group accounts for 19% of the total Bitcoin supply. Bitcoin treasury companies such as Strategy and Metaplanet have raised new capital amid the recent crash to buy more BTC. Saylor’s company recently raised $836 million from its STRE offering, which it used to buy 8,178 BTC. Meanwhile, Metaplanet raised $130 million to expand its BTC treasury. More Companies Set To Adopt Bitcoin More Bitcoin treasury companies are set to emerge as $10 trillion asset manager, Vanguard, will start offering BTC ETFs from today. Notably, some companies gain BTC exposure through these ETFs rather than buying Bitcoin directly. On-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence revealed that the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan, holds $300 million worth of BlackRock’s BTC ETF. Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Price Action With Chinese Astrology Shares When Prices Will Surge Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that Bitcoin treasuries such as Strategy are coming under immense pressure amid the current market downtrend. Strategy’s CEO, Phong Le, admitted that they might have to sell Bitcoin as a last resort to fund dividend payments if their mNAV drops below 1x and they can no longer raise capital. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $87,000, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pngtree, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Vs. Gold Metric Flashes Rare Signal Not Seen in Market History – See How",
    "body": "A key long-term indicator comparing Bitcoin to gold has just triggered a signal not seen before in market history. Analysts say such extreme compression typically precedes violent directional moves, and the fact that it’s happening at the intersection of two global safe-haven assets makes the setup even more significant. With BTC outperforming gold for over a decade, this rare signal suggests that the next phase of the BTC vs Gold battle could rewrite long-term market expectations. What Happens After A Historic Squeeze? The Bitcoin versus Gold monthly Bollinger Bands are expanding from the tightest reading in history. A chartered market technician and Bitcoin trader, Tony “The Bull” Severino, revealed on X that the price is currently sitting at the lower Bollinger band, and a decisive close below will trigger a sell signal as the bands expand from a squeeze setup. Related Reading: Analyst’s Full Market Breakdown Shows Why Bitcoin Price Is Headed For $120,000 According to TonyTheBullCMT, this setup creates the potential for a significant trending-down move, which is the first major downtrend on the BTC against Gold chart. This might look the same against the USD, so don’t expect it to translate 1:1 there. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that Gold looks ready to overshadow BTC. If BTC is at % billion in the middle and falling into that lower greenish section, it won’t be a good sign for BTC in this ratio. The weekly Bollinger Bands on this pair were the tightest ever in history, and since they began to expand, BTC dropped over 25% in a couple of weeks. Meanwhile, the monthly signal is at least 4x stronger. Bitcoin has been in a brutal downtrend throughout the year. Crypto analyst Zynx has pointed out that BTC is now sitting almost 50% below its all-time high against Gold, and the ratio shows that the crypto king has effectively been in a bear market for an entire year of 2025. Over the last 12 months, BTC has been down 45% against Gold. At this point, it would need to rally 99% to surpass its previous all-time high against Gold, which shows that BTC must hit around $170,000 before it can begin to claim a true bull market. Bitcoin And Gold Ratio Hits A Statistical Low Rarely Reached Bitcoin has reached one of its rarest valuation points relative to gold in more than a decade. An analyst and founder of GREEND0TS, Stacy Muur, highlighted that the BTC/Gold ratio has just dropped below the statistical lower boundary of a 15-year power-law model. Related Reading: Can The Bitcoin Price Explode To $200,000? The Gold Chart That Tells It All Interestingly, BTC has breached this level only once before in late 2017 and snapped back within weeks. Historically, when BTC gets this incredibly cheap compared to Gold, it doesn’t stay cheap against Gold for long. This is not a timing signal; rather, it is a rare statistical anomaly worth watching.

    "body": "On-chain data shows that the Bitcoin investors with a holding time greater than six months have seen an upward reversal in their supply for the first time in months. Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply Has Just Turned Around As pointed out by Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards in a new post on X, the 6-month inactive supply has recently witnessed its first uptick since April. This part of the supply, covering tokens that have been dormant (that is, not involved in any transaction on the blockchain) since at least six months ago, belongs to investors popularly known as long-term holders (LTHs). Related Reading: XRP Crashes 9.5%, But TD Sequential Flashes A Buy Signal Statistically, the longer investors keep their coins dormant, the less likely they are to sell them in the future. As such, the LTH cohort with its relatively long holding time includes the resolute hands of the market. Despite their resilience, however, these investors have participated in selling during the past few months. Below is the chart shared by Edwards that shows the trend in the amount of supply dormant for longer than six months. As is visible in the graph, the drawdown in the Bitcoin LTH supply changed for the worse during the cryptocurrency’s crash last month, indicating that the diamond hands took part in a significant amount of distribution. Since this selloff, however, the decline in the metric appears to have paused, at least for now. There has even been a small increase in the indicator recently, a potential sign of a shift in investor behavior. Something to note is that while drops in the LTH supply can correspond to selling that’s occurring in the present, the same isn’t true in the case of an increase. An uptick in the metric isn’t a sign that members of the cohort are buying right now. Rather, it suggests some accumulation occurred six months ago, and now those coins have been held long enough to mature into the group. That said, the trend is naturally still a positive sign for Bitcoin, as it implies HODLing behavior could be becoming more dominant on the network. The last time such a shift occurred was around the time of the cryptocurrency’s lows back in April. Related Reading: Ethereum Speculators Add $654M In Bets As Price Plunges To $2,800 What followed that LTH supply rise was BTC’s rally to new all-time highs (ATHs). Considering this, it only remains to be seen whether the latest shift toward long-term holding will lead to anything similar, or if the cryptocurrency’s decline is here to stay this time around. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly slipped under $84,000 on Monday, but its price has since seen some recovery as it’s now back at $87,500.

    "title": "Ethereum Open Interest Cut In Half As $6.4B In Positions Vanish: Market Reset Accelerates",
    "body": "Ethereum has fallen below the $2,800 mark after a sharp and sudden decline, deepening panic across the market and reinforcing the sense that bulls have lost control. The recent drop has pushed investors into defensive mode, with some analysts now openly discussing the possibility of a broader bear market emerging. Selling pressure has intensified across spot and derivatives markets, and volatility continues to rise as traders struggle to identify a reliable support zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Largest Hidden-Buying Spike of the Cycle Despite Losing $90K Level A new CryptoQuant report by Darkfost highlights one of the most alarming developments: Ethereum’s open interest on Binance has been steadily collapsing for more than three months. After reaching an all-time high of $12.6 billion on August 22, open interest has now been cut in half. Nearly $6.4 billion in derivative positions have evaporated, bringing ETH’s open interest down to $6.2 billion, a steep 51% decline. While this appears to be an extraordinary contraction, Darkfost notes that open interest has only just slipped below the previous all-time high of $7.7 billion. This underscores how speculative and overstretched the 2025 derivatives market had become — and suggests that Ethereum may be undergoing a much deeper structural reset than most expected. Speculation Unwinds Across Exchanges as Ethereum Enters Deep Reset Phase Darkfost emphasizes that 2025 has been the most speculative phase in Ethereum’s history, fueled by aggressive leverage, rapid inflows, and a market structure that proved far less solid — and far less sustainable — than it appeared during the rally. The collapse in open interest on Binance is only part of the story. The same pattern is unfolding across major derivatives platforms, revealing a broader structural unwind rather than an exchange-specific phenomenon. On Gate.io, ETH open interest has fallen from $5.2 billion to $3.5 billion. On Bybit, the drop is even more severe, plunging from $6.1 billion to $2.3 billion. This synchronized contraction shows how aggressively speculative positions have been flushed out. Meanwhile, the ongoing correction has dragged Ethereum’s price from $4,830 to $2,800, marking a steep 43% decline from the highs. This widespread reduction in leverage suggests the market is undergoing a deeper reset than typical corrections. Investors are not rushing to re-enter positions, especially as liquidations continue to stack up across exchanges. While shrinking open interest weighs on short-term momentum and sentiment, Darkfost notes that such aggressive deleveraging may ultimately help rebuild a healthier market foundation — one capable of supporting a durable bottom for ETH. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Distribution Continues: Whale Sends Another 5,000 ETH To Binance ETH Loses Key Trend Support as 3-Day Structure Turns Fully Bearish Ethereum’s 3-day chart shows a decisive breakdown in structure, with price now firmly below the 50 SMA, 100 SMA, and 200 SMA for the first time since late 2024. The rejection from the $3,600–$3,800 region triggered a strong impulse to the downside, sending ETH directly through all major moving averages and confirming a shift toward a higher-timeframe downtrend. The current trading zone around $2,800 reflects a critical test of former support, but momentum remains weak. The 50 SMA has now crossed below the 100 SMA, while both are beginning to converge downward toward the 200 SMA — a configuration that typically precedes sustained corrections. Volume has increased on red candles, showing that sellers remain dominant, and there is little evidence of aggressive dip-buying. The most recent candle wick toward $2,700 highlights vulnerability rather than strength, suggesting buyers are hesitant to defend this level with conviction.

If $2,750 breaks cleanly, the next significant liquidity zones sit near $2,550 and $2,300, where prior consolidations developed earlier in the cycle.

    "body": "Authorities in Europe have shut down a large crypto mixing service and seized a major amount of Bitcoin, according to law enforcement statements and media reports. The operation took down a key domain, seized servers, and captured $29 million in Bitcoin that investigators say was tied to illicit flows. Related Reading: XRP Is About To Hit A Major Turning Point This Week, Analyst Says Europol And Swiss Authorities Act Based on reports, a joint action by Europol, Swiss, and German authorities took place between November 24 and November 28, 2025. During the operation, three servers located in Switzerland were seized, the domain Cryptomixer.io was disabled, and investigators recovered about 12 terabytes of data. According to officials, the service had been used since 2016 and is linked to roughly €1.3 billion in laundered Bitcoin over that time. The cash figure seized in the takedown was reported at close to $30 million in Bitcoin. How The Service Worked Reports have disclosed that the site operated as a hybrid mixer. That means it accepted funds on the regular web and used techniques to pool, jumble, and redistribute coins so the origin of funds became hard to trace. Criminals allegedly used the service to hide proceeds from activities such as drug sales, ransomware attacks, and fraud, according to investigators. By randomizing amounts and delaying payouts, mixers like this make the usual tracking tools much less effective. What The Seized Data Could Reveal Law enforcement officers say the 12 terabytes of material may hold leads that point to other illegal transfers and the people behind them. The data is now being examined, and it could make it easier to trace how money moved through the service. It is not yet clear whether arrests have been made. Experts warn that even with seized material, tracing every tainted coin will be difficult because of how mixing services scramble transaction records. Related Reading: ‘Saylor Is Finished’ – Peter Schiff Slams Bitcoin Tycoon Over $1.44B Reserve Build-Up Wider Impact On Crypto Crime Investigators argue the takedown is a major blow against online money laundering in Europe. Based on reports, crypto mixers of this size helped mask hundreds of millions, and in some cases billions, of dollars over years. The removal of one large service may slow some criminal flows, but analysts caution that operators and users can migrate to other services or new tools. Criminals often adapt quickly, which means the broader problem may continue unless follow-up actions and legal steps are taken. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Liquidation Dominance Hits Multi-Year High: The Real Cause Behind BTC’s Breakdown",
    "body": "Bitcoin continues to trade below $90,000, struggling to recover after several days of heavy selling and aggressive long liquidations. Sellers keep pushing price lower, and bulls fail to reclaim momentum, creating a market environment filled with uncertainty and fear. Every attempt to bounce meets immediate resistance, showing how much control bears currently hold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Largest Hidden-Buying Spike of the Cycle Despite Losing $90K Level Data shared by Axel Adler shows a clear shift in derivatives pressure toward buyers. The liquidation dominance oscillator now sits at 32%, one of its highest readings in recent years. This level signals that leveraged bulls keep taking the majority of the damage, with long positions consistently wiped out as volatility rises. Instead of absorbing the drawdown, many traders continue to unwind or get forced out of their positions. These repeated long liquidations fuel deeper downside moves and block any meaningful recovery attempts. The market now watches closely to see whether this wave of forced selling will continue dragging Bitcoin lower or if the pressure is finally reaching exhaustion. Long Liquidations Dominate as Bitcoin Faces Renewed Downside Pressure Adler explains that the liquidation dominance oscillator measures the ratio between long and short liquidations across the derivatives market. When the indicator prints positive values, shown as green bars, long positions take the bulk of the damage. Negative values reflect a dominance of short liquidations. Bitcoin’s current reading of 32% stands out as one of the highest levels seen in the last three years, highlighting how aggressively bulls have been forced out during this correction. November illustrates this perfectly. The market saw three separate waves of long liquidations, each exceeding $400 million. Every one of those spikes aligned with a sharp acceleration in Bitcoin’s price decline, reinforcing how leveraged buyers repeatedly amplified downside momentum. Rather than stabilizing the market, each flush created more selling pressure and triggered deeper unwinding across futures platforms. The most recent liquidation wave reached $221 million, hitting the market right as Bitcoin attempted a short-term recovery. That flush immediately reversed the bounce and dragged BTC back down to the $86,000 region, erasing nearly all of last week’s gains. The persistent dominance of long liquidations shows that bulls remain under heavy stress—and until this dynamic eases, Bitcoin will struggle to build sustainable upside. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Distribution Continues: Whale Sends Another 5,000 ETH To Binance Bitcoin Market Searches for a Higher Time-Frame Floor Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows the market pressing into a critical support zone after weeks of heavy selling. The price has dropped from the $115,000 region to the $86,000–$88,000 range, where it now interacts directly with the 100 SMA. This moving average has served as a key structural support in previous cycles, and Bitcoin’s current test of it will likely determine whether the broader uptrend holds or breaks down further. The recent candles highlight intense volatility. Bitcoin briefly dipped to nearly $84,000 before buyers stepped in, forming a lower wick that shows early attempts to defend this level. However, the rebound remains shallow, and the 50 SMA continues to slope downward — a sign that short- and mid-term momentum still favors sellers. For bulls to regain control, BTC needs to reclaim $95,000 on a weekly closing basis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Break Key Supply Clusters To Regain ATH Momentum – Watch These Levels Volume adds weight to the bearish pressure. Selling spikes dominate recent weeks, revealing a mix of forced liquidations and fear-driven exits rather than healthy profit-taking. As long as BTC trades below the 50 SMA, the market remains vulnerable to deeper retracements. If the 100 SMA fails to hold, the next major liquidity zone sits near $70,000–$72,000, aligning with previous consolidation and the long-term 200 SMA. The next weekly close will be decisive.

    "body": "XRP price started a recovery wave from $1.9840. The price is now rising above $2.120 and might face hurdles near the $2.250 pivot level. XRP price started a recovery wave from the $1.9840 zone. The price is now trading above $2.120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2.150 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above $2.250. XRP Price Recovers Over 5% XRP price extended losses below the $2.050 support, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price even spiked below $2.00 before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $1.9844, and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above the $2.050 and $2.120 levels. The bulls were able to push the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.2750 swing high to the $1.9844 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2.150 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.20 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.2750 swing high to the $1.9844 low. The first major resistance is near the $2.250 level. A close above $2.250 could send the price to $2.320. The next hurdle sits at $2.350. A clear move above the $2.350 resistance might send the price toward the $2.40 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.450 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.50. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.250 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.120 level. The next major support is near the $2.10 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.10 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.050. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.920. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.120 and $2.10. Major Resistance Levels – $2.20 and $2.250.",

    "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price In A ‘Vulnerable Technical Environment’ – Key Levels To Watch",
    "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) began the week dropping nearly 10% from the recent highs and retesting the $84,000 area before bouncing. As price risks more downside with early bear market signals, a market observer suggested that the upcoming weeks will be crucial for BTC’s future path. Related Reading: Zcash (ZEC) Leads Market Pullback With 24% Drop, Analysts Warn Of Another Crash Ahead Bitcoin Holds Key Weekly Range Last week, Bitcoin led the brief market recovery, surging from its seven-month low of $80,600 toward the $93,000 area, retesting a key weekly re-accumulation range between these two levels. However, the Sunday correction sent the price back to the range lows, raising concerns about the flagship crypto’s short-term future. Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that BTC is stabilizing within its weekly range, holding its position above the $82,000 range low. This area marks the top of an early 2025 liquidity cluster that developed around the 50-Week EMA, where the price has tapped with three downside wicks over the past month. “Last week’s Weekly Close above the Range Low enabled a relief move toward $93,500,” the analyst explained, “but that level acted as clean resistance,” after Friday’s rejection. To the analyst, maintaining stability around the weekly range lows is important because further downside wicking into the cluster is probable. However, he noted that the consolidation structure remains intact as long as BTC’s price continues to hold above the range low in the weekly timeframe. Rekt Capital added that Bitcoin continues to trade below a sharply declining Macro Downtrend that “has been dictating resistance throughout this phase of the cycle.” Per the analysis, “A breakout soon would require reclaiming higher price levels, whereas a later attempt would meet the trendline at lower valuations, narrowing the distance between the current price and resistance.” “In either case, the Macro Downtrend remains the dominant structural barrier, and Bitcoin’s path forward depends on whether consolidation near the Weekly Range Low can bring price closer to a meaningful test of this sharply descending level,” he continued. BTC’s Vulnerable Technical Environment Raises Alarms Rekt Capital also highlighted that BTC remains below the 21-Week EMA and 50-Week EMA, which could pose a problem for its future price action as the distance between these moving averages continues to narrow. As he detailed, when these EMAs compress and ultimately cross, it tends to precede further downside. Although it usually takes weeks after the crossover for price acceleration to “fully unfold,” it still implies that the crossover risk is increasing. The two EMAs currently represent potential resistance levels on future relief attempts, with the 50-Week EMA retest “leaving room for a future rejection if price revisits it.” Related Reading: Revisiting $85,000: Bitcoin Price Drop Linked To Japanese Government Bonds This position, the analyst explained, places BTC in a “vulnerable technical environment” as “the convergence of the EMAs toward the Macro Downtrend creates a layered zone of resistance that will be difficult to overcome unless price can reclaim one of these moving averages and stabilise above it.” Until Bitcoin successfully turns one of the EMAs into support, “the structure resembles the early-stage clustering seen in prior cycles where EMAs compressed before a broader bearish continuation,” the analyst concluded. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $88,294, a 2.3% increase in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Slump Claims New Victims: Leveraged ETFs Tied To Strategy Suffer Major Losses",
    "body": "Despite a 9% recovery on Tuesday, Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced considerable volatility, with its price plummeting to as low as $84,000 just 24 hours ago. This downturn has had a significant impact on Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) the public company that holds the largest BTC reserves, currently boasting over 650,000 coins. Strategy T-Rex ETFs Plummet Nearly 85% NewsBTC reported that the company’s CEO, Phong Le, suggested the possibility of selling some of their Bitcoin holdings in light of the current market conditions. Alongside this, the company’s leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also faced substantial losses, intensifying worries about Strategy’s financial health. Reuters highlighted that Strategy’s leveraged ETFs, which are designed to magnify returns on the firm’s stock, have been among the largest casualties of this year’s cryptocurrency slump. Related Reading: You Won’t Believe How Much Bitcoin Companies Now Hold, What % Of Supply Do They Control? Two specific ETFs, the T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF and the Defiance Daily Target 2x Long MSTR ETF, have seen dramatic declines, losing nearly 85% of their value this year. Additionally, the T-Rex 2X Inverse MSTR Daily Target ETF has dropped by 48% in the same time frame. In this environment, shares of Strategy, MSTR, have fallen more than 40% this year, driven primarily by Bitcoin’s price crash. Investor attention is now focused on Strategy’s “mNAV” (market net asset value) metric, which compares the company’s enterprise value to its Bitcoin holdings. Following Le’s comments, where he mentioned the firm might consider selling cryptocurrencies if the mNAV drops below 1, concerns grew about the firm’s long-term outlook. Current estimates place this ratio around 1.1, according to calculations by Reuters. Analysts Remain Optimistic Mike O’Rourke, the chief market strategist at JonesTrading, noted that Le’s remarks diminish the company’s message of steadfastness in holding Bitcoin, even amid market volatility. The company has also revised its full-year outlook, warning of a potential profit ranging from $6.3 billion to a loss of $5.5 billion, a stark adjustment from its earlier forecast of $24 billion in net profit. This prior estimate, made on October 30, anticipated Bitcoin reaching $150,000 by year-end. Commenting on the shifting strategies within the firm, Vincenzo Vedda, chief investment officer at DWS, remarked, “Great strategy from Strategy, while prices go up. When they go down, well, the strategic options left to the company are limited.” Related Reading: Here’s What To Expect If The XRP Price Holds $2 Since entering the Nasdaq 100 index, Strategy’s shares have dropped more than 70% from their peak in November 2024, more than halving in value over the year. Despite this dismal performance, analyst sentiments remain relatively optimistic; of the 16 brokerages monitoring Strategy, 10 recommend it as a “buy” while four suggest a “strong buy,” with an overall median price target of $485, reflecting a potential 183% increase over the next year based on LSEG data. When writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, managed to recover the $92,000 line. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Cardano (ADA) has opened December under pressure, dropping more than 7% in the past week as broader market sentiment weakens and macroeconomic uncertainty rises. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders See First Uptick Since April Lows: Bullish Sign? ADA is now trading near $0.38–$0.4, testing key support levels and extending a month-long downtrend that has erased recent gains. ADA's price gains some small gains on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Macroeconomic Pressure and Market Sentiment Weigh on ADA The latest decline comes amid renewed concerns over global interest rate policy. Comments from Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda signaled the possibility of a rate hike, a shift that could unwind leveraged positions funded through low-interest yen borrowing. Cardano’s drop aligns with losses seen across the crypto market, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major altcoins also trading lower. High trading volumes, over $1 billion in the past 24 hours, reflect elevated volatility and growing caution among investors. On-chain indicators show dormant ADA wallets from as far back as 2017 moving coins to exchanges, a sign that long-term holders may be preparing to exit positions. Short interest in ADA futures has also increased, with open interest rising 12% over the past week. Traders are betting on a further slide below $0.35 unless ADA can reclaim the $0.40 resistance level. Ecosystem Developments Offer Some Long-Term Support Despite the market downturn, several developments within the Cardano ecosystem continue to generate attention. A $30 million liquidity initiative designed to strengthen Cardano’s DeFi sector is scheduled for rollout in early 2026. The fund aims to boost total value locked by supporting lending, staking, and decentralized exchange activity, areas where Cardano has historically lagged behind competitors. Another upcoming milestone is the launch of the Midnight sidechain on December 8. The privacy-focused network introduces new capabilities around data protection and secure enterprise applications. Some analysts believe the launch could increase Cardano’s adoption and improve sentiment, particularly if it leads to more activity in decentralized finance. Cardano’s long-term technical outlook also remains a topic of debate. Analysts note that ADA is once again touching the support line of a multi-year uptrend. Historically, similar tests have preceded recoveries, with some projecting a possible rebound toward the $0.50–$0.75 range if the market stabilizes. What Comes Next for Cardano (ADA)? The near-term outlook for Cardano remains uncertain. A break below $0.38 could expose the token to further declines toward the $0.30 area, especially if broader market weakness continues. However, strong staking participation, around 70% of circulating supply, may help cushion deeper drawdowns. Longer-term forecasts vary widely, ranging from modest recoveries to highly optimistic projections tied to expected ecosystem upgrades in 2026. Related Reading: Bitcoin Vs.

    "body": "Bitcoin has turned itself around with a sharp surge to $92,000, unleashing a fresh wave of short liquidations on the derivatives exchanges. Bitcoin Has Seen A Flash Recovery Back To $92,000 Bitcoin suffered a blow on Monday as its price slipped under $84,000, but just as quickly as it had crashed, the cryptocurrency has made a swift recovery on Tuesday. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders See First Uptick Since April Lows: Bullish Sign? With the asset’s price now floating above $92,000, its price has surged by more than 8% over the last 24 hours. Like is usually the case, Bitcoin hasn’t been alone in this rally; the rest of the cryptocurrency market has also shot up alongside the number one digital asset. Some of the top altcoins have even managed to outperform BTC, with Ethereum (ETH) sitting in a profit of nearly 10% for the past day. The fresh wave of volatility in the sector has triggered a liquidation squeeze in the derivatives market. Crypto Liquidations Have Crossed $400 Million In Last 24 Hours According to data from CoinGlass, the cryptocurrency market as a whole has suffered over $410 million in liquidations during the past day. “Liquidation” here naturally refers to the forceful closure that any contract undergoes after it has amassed a certain percentage of loss (as defined by the platform). Considering that the price action in this window was majorly to the upside, it’s not surprising to see that short contracts made up for most of the derivatives flush. As is visible in the above table, $348 million in short positions found liquidation in the last 24 hours, equivalent to about 85% of the total flush. In terms of the individual symbols, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana were the top three contributors to the liquidation event with $196 million, $95 million, and $18 million in positions, respectively. Just $13 million of the Bitcoin liquidations involved long investors; the rest $182 million in liquidations struck the traders betting on a bearish outcome for the cryptocurrency. A mass liquidation event like this latest one is popularly known as a squeeze. Today’s squeeze involved shorts in an extreme majority, so the event will be termed a short squeeze. During a squeeze, a sharp swing in the price triggers a large derivatives flush, which only ends up feeding back into the price move. The amplified price swing then unleashes a further cascade of liquidations.

    "title": "$93K And Climbing: Analysts Say Bitcoin’s Push To $100K Has Begun",
    "body": "Bitcoin jumped back above key levels on Wednesday, with prices climbing past $93,000 after dipping to $84,400 earlier this month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trail Ends: $29M Seized After European Authorities Shut Down Cryptomixer The move followed a sharp sell-off that removed about $8,000 from the price late over the weekend, and traders pushed the coin to a 24-hour peak of $93,910 on Coingecko. Bitcoin Climbs Above Key Levels According to MN Fund founder Michaël van de Poppe, regaining ground above $93,000 is important for momentum. He said that if the price holds and breaks higher, a run toward $100,000 becomes more likely. Other analysts echoed the call: Nick Ruck of LVRG Research pointed to macro factors and fresh ETF flows as drivers that could help Bitcoin test six figures in the coming months. This is what you’d want to see. $BTC coming back up again, after a weird move down on the 1st of this month. Now, again, breaking the $92K area is crucial. If that breaks, then I’m sure we’ll start to see a new all-time high and a test at $100K. A great day on the markets. pic.twitter.com/uy6WPabnQ8 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 2, 2025 ETF Activity And Market Moves Reports have disclosed that ETF-related trading helped lift the market. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded over $1.8 billion in volume within two hours after Vanguard reversed a previous stance, and total spot Bitcoin ETF volume topped $5.1 billion on the day. Market stats showed the broader crypto capitalization rose close to 7% to $3.13 trillion, with BTC dominance climbing to nearly 60%. Bitcoin itself jumped by about 8% after the US market opened, giving larger markets a clear lift. Support Zone Holds Focus Analysts had been watching the $86,000 to $88,000 band as a critical area of support. Based on reports from active market watchers, that range had been tested dozens of times in recent months and holding above it signaled reduced selling pressure. One analyst argued that a break below would likely lead some big players to change tack, moving from buying to selling behavior. Liquidations And Net Inflows Changed The Day Other market observers reported heavy turnover in derivatives and spot markets: over $360 billion in short positions were liquidated, while more than $160 billion was reportedly added back into crypto markets within a 24-hour span. Those figures, if accurate, helped explain the speed of the rebound and the large single-day gains. Related Reading: XRP Is About To Hit A Major Turning Point This Week, Analyst Says What Comes Next For Prices Short-term traders will watch how Bitcoin behaves around $92,000 and whether it can hold above the $86,000–$88,000 floor. Some commentators warned that sudden ETF-driven demand can cause sharp spikes that may not last. Others pointed to possible policy shifts, such as renewed talk of US interest-rate cuts, as reasons why money might flow into major crypto assets in the months ahead. For now, prices sit a little above $92,700 at the time of writing. The market is clearly volatile. Investors and traders will likely need to balance the bullish signs against the risk that a fresh round of selling could wipe gains quickly. Featured image from Gemini, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Best Crypto to Buy as Kevin Hassett Takes Fed Chair and Loosens Policy Fueling $BTC",
    "body": "What to Know: A more dovish, crypto-friendly Fed chair like Kevin Hassett could extend a multi‑year liquidity cycle, favoring Bitcoin and high‑beta altcoins. Position sizing, diversification, and risk management remain critical, even when macro conditions and narratives seem heavily tilted in crypto’s favor. Bitcoin Hyper’s SVM-powered Layer 2 aims to unlock low-latency smart contracts and DeFi around $BTC while preserving Bitcoin settlement security. PEPENODE and Dogwifhat provide meme and community-driven upside exposure if easier policy reignites speculative flows into Solana and broader alt markets. Speculation that Kevin Hassett could take over the Fed with a more dovish, pro-risk stance is exactly the kind of macro shift crypto loves. Trump has made repeated references to Hassett , so it wouldn’t come as a surprise. A chair who’s comfortable with deeper rate cuts and friendlier optics toward digital assets doesn’t just move markets for a quarter; it reshapes liquidity conditions for years. Cheaper money and clearer political cover for Bitcoin would likely mean a stronger bid for $BTC first, then a spillover into high-beta altcoins and infrastructure plays. If that happens, you want exposure to assets that benefit structurally from a multi‑year adoption wave. That’s where Bitcoin-focused scaling, speculative meme liquidity, and Solana ecosystem bets start to matter, making them the best crypto to buy . You’re not just guessing charts; you’re aligning with where capital, developers, and users could cluster if 2026–2028 turns into another extended risk cycle. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , and Dogwifhat ($WIF) , although all different, are potentially geared to thrive if a Hassett-led Fed extends easy policy and pushes fresh capital back into crypto. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Bitcoin Layer 2 Bringing Bitcoin Security With SVM Speed If looser Fed policy sends Bitcoin back into price discovery, the next big bottleneck won’t be demand for $BTC, it’ll be what you can do with it. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) positions itself as a Bitcoin Layer 2 with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, aiming to turn dormant $BTC into fully programmable capital. Instead of trying to bolt slow EVM logic onto Bitcoin, $HYPER uses a modular design: Bitcoin L1 for settlement and a real-time SVM-powered L2 for execution. That architecture targets sub-second finality and low fees while anchoring state periodically to Bitcoin, giving builders Solana-style speed with Bitcoin-grade trust assumptions. The project leans on a single trusted sequencer, with periodic L1 state anchoring, and supports SPL-compatible tokens customized for its Layer 2. That opens the door to Solana-like DeFi, swaps, lending, and staking protocols but with wrapped $BTC as a first-class asset, plus Rust SDKs and APIs for gaming dApps and NFT platforms. From a capital-rotation lens, the numbers are already notable. The $HYPER presale has raised over $28.8M with tokens currently at $0.013365, showing a clear appetite from investors looking ahead of any macro pivot. Our experts see future potential as well, with an end-of-2026 price prediction hitting $0.08625. That’d see you with a potential ROI of over 545% if you invested at today’s price. If you get in early, you can also take advantage of dynamic staking rewards, currently sitting at 40%. Being a $HYPER holder, you also get rewards tied to community and governance participation. If you believe a Hassett-led Fed kickstarts a new liquidity cycle centered on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Hyper is a direct bet on scaling that demand. Join the $HYPER presale today. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): Mine-to-Earn Without the Overheads Every easy-money cycle has a meme phase, and if the Fed turns dovish again, you can expect speculative capital to chase narratives that blend culture, game mechanics, and upside. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE ) leans into that with a mine‑to‑earn meme coin pitch, trying to gamify yield and engagement rather than just relying on vibes. Instead of just traditional staking, PEPENODE uses a Virtual Mining System and tiered node rewards to simulate mining economics in a meme wrapper. You effectively run virtual nodes through a gamified dashboard, competing for higher reward tiers and social status. This isn’t only fun, but it can help keep community participation high during volatile markets. Learn how to buy PEPENODE. The $PEPENODE presale has already gained traction, having raised over $2.2M with tokens currently priced at $0.0011778. This puts it firmly in low-cap, high-optional-value territory if meme risk-on returns. And with staking rewards as high as 576% there’s even more incentive to opt-in. That blend of narrative and gameified mechanics gives it a different profile from pure hype coins that rely solely on social media. As a bonus, you can even earn rewards in other popular coins like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN. If dovish policy stokes another wave of speculative flows, $PEPENODE is a way to express that trade in a structured, mine‑to‑earn format rather than a raw punt. Don’t miss the mine and get your $PEPENODE today. 3. Dogwifhat ($WIF): Solana Meme Beta for a Liquidity Wave Any discussion of meme beta in this cycle has to include Dogwifhat ($WIF) , the Solana-based meme coin that’s become a proxy for retail risk appetite. Built on Solana, $WIF benefits from low fees and high throughput, helping speculative traders rotate in and out quickly without the friction you see on slower chains. Recent market action underlines that reflexivity. $WIF rallied over 20% in a single seven‑day stretch, reclaiming momentum among Solana meme coins. It currently sits around rank #109 by market cap, with strong trading activity and recurring bursts of retail attention. Beyond price, $WIF has a sticky community that treats it as a cultural asset, not just a ticker. In a macro regime where the Fed signals friendlier policy, that kind of community‑driven liquidity can compound quickly as traders hunt for leverage to a Solana-led alt season. If you expect a Hasset Fed to extend the runway for high‑beta risk, Dogwifhat ($WIF) is a straightforward way to capture Solana meme exposure without betting on unproven microcaps. It sits at the intersection of chain narrative, cheap blockspace, and viral culture. Buy $WIF on top exchanges like Binance. Recap: If Kevin Hassett ushers in a looser Fed, Bitcoin Hyper , PEPENODE , and Dogwifhat each offer distinct ways to ride that liquidity wave. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.
