    "title": "Market Stress Continues As Bitcoin STH SOPR Dips Below 1– When Will The Pain End?",
    "body": "Bitcoin continues to struggle below the $90,000 level, failing to reclaim key resistance as bulls attempt to defend current demand zones. Price action reflects a market under pressure, with momentum fading after a prolonged correction. From its all-time high, Bitcoin has now retraced roughly 30%, placing the asset firmly in a corrective phase where uncertainty and caution dominate trading behavior. Related Reading: Ethereum Trades Near Whales’ Cost Basis For The Fourth Time Since 2021 – Historic Test According to a report from Axel Adler, on-chain data confirms that market stress is no longer limited to price alone. Two key indicators—the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR) and the P/L Block—are signaling broad loss realization among participants and a deterioration in overall market sentiment. These metrics provide insight into the behavior of short-term holders, who are often the most sensitive to price swings and macro uncertainty. Together, these signals suggest that Bitcoin remains in a fragile state, where confidence has weakened, and recovery attempts face increasing resistance. STH SOPR and P/L Block Confirm Capitulation Pressure Adler explains that the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR) measures whether coins held for less than 155 days are being sold at a profit or a loss. When the indicator falls below one, it signals that recent buyers are realizing losses. Currently, the 7-day moving average of STH SOPR has slipped into the red zone, with a reading near 0.99. This confirms that short-term holders are, on average, selling Bitcoin below their acquisition price—a behavior typically associated with heightened stress and emotional selling. Historically, similar SOPR conditions have marked local capitulation phases, when selling pressure peaks and weaker hands exit the market. As long as the SOPR 7-day average remains below one, short-term participants stay in “stress mode.” Adler notes that a meaningful improvement would require a sustained move back above one on a daily close, signaling that sellers have exhausted supply and buyers are once again absorbing sell-side pressure. Complementing this signal, the P/L Block indicator tracks the aggregated profit and loss state of market participants. The current red block reflects loss dominance, with a P/L Score of minus three—classified as pronounced stress. With Bitcoin down 30% from its all-time high and 30-day returns negative, both indicators align, reinforcing a clear picture of capitulation among short-term holders.

Price has retraced aggressively but is now attempting to stabilize above the rising 200-week moving average (green), a level that has historically defined long-term trend validity. So far, this area is acting as dynamic support, suggesting that buyers are defending higher-cycle structure despite broader market weakness. However, Bitcoin remains below the 50-week moving average (blue), which is now sloping downward. This configuration reflects a loss of medium-term momentum and confirms that the market is still in a corrective phase rather than a resumed uptrend. The 100-week moving average (red) continues to rise well below price, reinforcing that the broader macro trend remains intact, but also highlighting how much excess was built during the prior rally.

This typically precedes a volatility expansion. From a structural perspective, holding above the $85,000–$88,000 zone is critical. A sustained breakdown below the 200-week MA would increase the probability of a deeper retracement toward the $75,000–$80,000 region. Conversely, reclaiming the 50-week MA near $95,000 would be an early signal that downside pressure is fading. Until then, Bitcoin remains range-bound, with long-term support holding but momentum still fragile. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Can Bitcoin Price Still Hit $140,000? What The Global M2 Money Supply Says",
    "body": "The Bitcoin price outlook remains under scrutiny as market analysts assess whether the world’s largest cryptocurrency can still reach $140,000. Given BTC’s recent downturn and fluctuating price, it’s understandable that a dramatic surge to $140,000 could be viewed skeptically. However, the analyst points to global M2 Money Supply, highlighting its correlation with Bitcoin and its support for a significant upside move. New discussions have emerged in the crypto space about the relationship between the Bitcoin price action and the global M2 Money Supply. Pseudonymous crypto analyst ‘MoneyLord’ has projected a massive price surge to $140,000 for BTC based on M2 data. The analyst noted that many people are skeptical about the relevance of M2 Money Supply, likely questioning whether it still holds predictive value for Bitcoin’s performance. Global M2 Money Supply To Fuel $140,000 Bitcoin Price Surge According to MoneyLord, the recent disconnect between Bitcoin and M2 data should not be viewed as a failure of the model, but rather as a consequence of aggressive market interference and increased stress across global financial systems. In his technical report released on X, he argued that, without heavy manipulation and the collapse and insolvency of major entities, Bitcoin would have continued to track global liquidity growth. Related Reading: Is It More Profitable To Hold Bitcoin For The Short-Term? 2025 Numbers Are Here MoneyLord believes that those shocks temporarily suppressed BTC’s price expansion, likely contributing to its recent decline and slow momentum. With market conditions somewhat stabilizing, the analyst suggests that Bitcoin is poised to realign with global M2 Money Supply trends, potentially setting the stage for renewed upward momentum. From this perspective, the current phase is viewed as a delayed reaction rather than a failed cycle. MoneyLord predicts that if Bitcoin begins to catch up with M2 data, the cryptocurrency’s price could hit a target above $140,000 sooner than the market expects. The accompanying chart illustrates this bullish outlook, showing global liquidity, represented by the blue line, continuing to rise toward the projected price. With Bitcoin trading near $90,000 after a more than 6% decline this month, a rally to $140,000 would require a gain of at least 55%. Reaching this level would set a new all-time high, exceeding its present peak of over $126,000 by more than 10%. Bitcoin Shows Resilience Amid Market Sell-Offs According to crypto analyst Don, Bitcoin has bounced back after a period of sharp sell-offs that shook out many traders and triggered widespread liquidations. The analyst noted that bulls have stepped in to reclaim critical support and restore confidence in the market as BTC resumes trading within a well-defined ascending triangle pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Losses From Entities Surges To 2022 Levels Following Crash Below $90,000 The chart shows that the triangle has an upper boundary near $94,324 and a lower boundary around $89,241.

    "title": "Why Bitcoin’s Quiet Price Action May Be ‘Dangerous’ – IFP Signals Rising Structural Risk",
    "body": "Bitcoin continues to struggle below the $90,000 level, failing to reclaim higher ground as bulls focus on defending current demand zones. After a sharp correction from recent highs, price action has entered a consolidation phase that, on the surface, appears relatively calm. Volatility has compressed, and short-term price movements suggest a market pausing rather than decisively breaking down. However, this apparent stability may be misleading. Related Reading: Ethereum Trades Near Whales’ Cost Basis For The Fourth Time Since 2021 – Historic Test According to a CryptoQuant report from XWIN Research Japan, on-chain data is signaling growing structural risk beneath the surface. The Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP), a metric that tracks the movement of Bitcoin between exchanges and serves as a proxy for internal market liquidity, has turned red. In such environments, price moves tend to be sharper and less orderly once direction is established. While reduced exchange balances can limit immediate selling pressure, they also amplify the impact of sudden demand or forced liquidations. This shift indicates a clear slowdown in capital circulation across trading venues, suggesting that liquidity conditions are deteriorating. Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse Signals Structural Fragility The report explains that the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP) measures how actively Bitcoin moves from one exchange to another, serving as a proxy for internal market liquidity and capital circulation. When IFP is elevated, capital rotates efficiently across venues, arbitrage opportunities are quickly absorbed, and liquidity providers keep order books deep. In those conditions, price discovery is smoother, and volatility tends to remain contained. By contrast, when IFP declines, the market’s internal “blood flow” weakens. Capital becomes static, liquidity fragments, and prices grow increasingly sensitive to relatively small trades. This deterioration in liquidity is unfolding alongside historically low exchange balances. While reduced sellable supply can initially act as price support, it also creates thinner order books. Once price begins to move decisively in either direction, slippage increases and volatility accelerates. With leverage still elevated across derivatives markets, instability becomes driven less by directional conviction and more by the magnitude of forced reactions. Historically, periods when IFP turned red produced abrupt corrections and sharp price swings, not clean trends. The central risk today is therefore not aggressive distribution, but structural fragility. Until inter-exchange liquidity improves, Bitcoin remains vulnerable to sudden, outsized moves, making leveraged positioning particularly risky in the current market structure. Related Reading: XRP Whale Activity Spikes At The Bottom – A Classic Pre-Rally Signal Bitcoin Price Consolidates Below Key Moving Averages The 4-hour Bitcoin chart highlights a market locked in consolidation after a sharp corrective move. Following the aggressive sell-off in late November, BTC found a local bottom near the $82,000–$83,000 zone, where strong demand stepped in and triggered a rebound. However, that recovery quickly lost momentum, and price is now ranging below the descending cluster of moving averages. Bitcoin is currently trading around the $89,000–$90,000 level, repeatedly failing to reclaim the 200-period moving average on the 4-hour timeframe. The 50 and 100 moving averages are also sloping downward, acting as dynamic resistance and reinforcing the short-term bearish structure. Each attempt to push higher has been met with selling pressure, suggesting that bulls lack conviction at current levels. Related Reading: This Whale Isn’t Stopping: $392M Ethereum Long And A Tight Liquidation Price Revealed Volume has noticeably contracted during this consolidation phase, indicating reduced participation and indecision among traders. This typically precedes a volatility expansion, especially when price compresses beneath major resistance. Structurally, BTC remains vulnerable as long as it trades below the $92,000–$94,000 zone, which previously acted as support and now caps upside attempts. On the downside, the $87,000–$88,000 range is emerging as immediate support. A decisive breakdown below this area could reopen the path toward the $84,000 region. Until a clear breakout occurs, Bitcoin remains in a fragile balance between distribution and base-building. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Advances As A Recognized Digital Asset In Regulated Markets — Here’s How",
    "body": "The narrative surrounding XRP, the digital asset native to the XRP Ledger, has shifted from a speculative cryptocurrency to a recognized digital asset within the global financial system. This shift reflects growing legal clarity and rising interest from financial institutions seeking compliant blockchain-based solutions for payments, liquidity, and settlement. How Institutional Interest In XRP Continues To Build As XRP gains recognition in regulated financial markets, it’s moving beyond its earlier perception as a speculative digital asset. An analyst known as Skipper_xrp has mentioned on X that this milestone has placed XRP in the conversation alongside traditional assets that institutions already trust. With recent developments from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and rising institutional interest, investors are wondering whether XRP’s growing credibility could be the catalyst for the next major price movement. Related Reading: Not Just Crypto: Research Says XRP Is Moving Into Bank-Grade Payment Infrastructure Meanwhile, tokenization is no longer a theoretical concept; it’s now a tangible reality. The ability to unlock trillions of dollars in real-world assets through blockchain is transforming how the markets will operate. On this front, the REAL token on the XRP Ledger isn’t just participating, it’s leading the change, and opening doors to an unprecedented global market. Ripple recently made the single biggest unlock for XRP since the case against the US SEC, and it has nothing to do with a court ruling. X Finance Bull has provided insight into the CLARITY Act, which legally defines digital commodities under CFTC oversight, eliminating guesswork and excuses from institutions. The real barrier to mass XRP adoption wasn’t tech or liquidity, but a legal risk, and that wall just cracked wide open. Currently, banks can use XRP rails, brokers can move in flow, and corporate treasuries can hold XRP on their books without stepping into uncertainty. This isn’t future potential; it’s the regulatory permission that is required before deploying serious capital. Many tokens don’t fit the mold, but XRP already operates on payment-grade, bank-ready infrastructure designed for real-world settlement, and first in line for real volume. “When institutions get the green light, the token with roads already built will lead,” Xfinancebull noted. A New Gateway Between Asian Markets And Ripple Labs Technical analyst, ChartNerd, revealed that VivoPower International PLC has quietly transformed a standard joint venture agreement into a strategic expansion vehicle with asymmetric exposure. Instead of deploying heavy capital, the structure creates a bridge between Seoul’s institutional crypto markets and Ripple Labs’ private equity, which is aligning with access rather than ownership. Related Reading: Fed Turns On The Liquidity Hose, XRP Ready To Ignite, Investor Claims ChartNerd stated that the play is targeting $300 million in Ripple Lab shares. Furthermore, VivoPower has a capital-light model that delivers substantial upside while minimizing corporate risk. Featured image from Peakpx, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "Bitcoin risks a further drop toward the $70,000 area if the Bank of Japan follows through with an expected interest-rate rise on Dec. 19, analysts focused on macro forces warned. Related Reading: Analyst: Bitcoin’s Cycle Is Intact, Yet No Longer Purely Market-Driven According to multiple macro-focused voices, the move could sap global liquidity and put fresh downward pressure on risk assets, with some traders already bracing for a sharp pullback. Japan’s policy shift matters because higher rates tend to strengthen the yen and raise the cost of borrowing. When that happens, traders who previously borrowed cheaply in yen to invest elsewhere are often forced to unwind those positions. That process can pull money out of global markets in a short period of time, and Bitcoin has often felt that impact as investors cut exposure during risk-off stretches. BOJ Tightening Drains Global Liquidity According to AndrewBTC, every BOJ hike since 2024 has coincided with Bitcoin drawdowns of more than 20%. Based on reports, the analyst pointed to declines of roughly 23% in March 2024, 26% in July 2024, and 31% in January 2025. 🚨 BREAKING: JAPAN WILL CRASH $BTC Bank of Japan is set to hike rates +25 bps on Dec 19. Japan = largest holder of US government debt 🇯🇵 📉 Look at the $BTC chart: Every BoJ rate hike → Bitcoin dumps over 20%+👇 • March 2024 → -23% • July 2024 → -26% • January 2025 →… pic.twitter.com/grN3QRNUg4 — AndrewBTC (@cryptoctlt) December 13, 2025 Traders are not only watching central bank calendars. Bitcoin’s daily chart also flashed a classic bear flag formation after a steep fall from the $105,000–$110,000 area in November. Market Positioning Widens Ahead Of Key Data Bitcoin slipped below $90,000 in thin trading on Sunday, a move that traders took as a cautionary sign rather than a definitive trigger. Based on reports, Ether held up better than many altcoins, suggesting selective risk taking in the market. Traders are positioning before a busy slate of US data and central bank events that could sway flows. Analyst EX bluntly warned BTC will collapse “below $70,000” under the stated macro conditions, a stark forecast that highlights how crowded bets can amplify moves when liquidity is pulled. EVERY TIME JAPAN HIKES RATES, BITCOIN DUMPS 20–25% NEXT WEEK, THEY WILL HIKE RATES TO 75 BPS AGAIN. IF THE PATTERN HOLDS, $BTC WILL DUMP BELOW $70,000 ON DECEMBER 19. POSITION ACCORDINGLY. pic.twitter.com/IWU8JbXjn3 — ΞX (@rektbyEX) December 13, 2025 Related Reading: Bitcoin Pulls Back Under $89K, Michael Saylor Smells Opportunity What This Means For Investors The story tying BOJ policy to Bitcoin’s swings is simple in outline: when funding costs in Japan rise, global borrowing becomes pricier, and risk assets can be sold as positions are reduced. That dynamic helps explain why past BOJ moves lined up with 20-30% declines in Bitcoin. Still, markets often try to price events ahead of time; a hike that’s already built into prices may have a smaller effect than one that comes as a surprise.

    "title": "Cardano SuperTrend Turns Bearish—Last Signal Preceded 80% ADA Drop",
    "body": "A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how Cardano has formed a technical analysis (TA) signal on its weekly chart that last led into a major price drawdown. Cardano SuperTrend Has Flipped Bearish In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a signal that has appeared in the SuperTrend of Cardano. The “SuperTrend” refers to a TA indicator that’s generally used for determining whether a given asset is following a bearish or bullish trend. It’s built using the Average True Range (ATR), another TA indicator that measures the degree of volatility being experienced by the price. Related Reading: XRP Mildly Undervalued On MVRV: What About Bitcoin, Ethereum? The SuperTrend is represented by a single trendline that acts as both support and resistance, depending on which side the asset is trading. When the price is above this line, the indicator signals that the asset is in a bullish trend. On the other hand, being under the line implies the dominance of a bearish trajectory. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the SuperTrend of Cardano over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the weekly Cardano price broke above the SuperTrend line during 2023 and stayed over it throughout 2024 and much of 2025. Recently, however, the price has finally seen a reversal of trend, with the indicator now giving a bearish signal instead. In the chart, Martinez has highlighted what happened the last time that this pattern developed in ADA’s 1-week price. It would appear that the flip to a bearish trend led to a decline of more than 80% for the cryptocurrency in 2022. It now remains to be seen whether the SuperTrend giving a sell signal is foreshadowing something similar this time, or if Cardano will see the renewal of bullish momentum despite the pattern. Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Forms Signal That Last Led To 95% Price Rally Cardano isn’t the only coin in the sector that has seen a flip in the SuperTrend recently. As the analyst has highlighted in another X post, the number one cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has also seen a change in its SuperTrend. From the above chart, it’s apparent that the weekly price of Bitcoin is now trading under the SuperTrend line, a sign that a bearish trend is taking over. Like for Cardano, the last time this flip happened was in the last bear market. Back then, BTC dropped by over 60%. ADA Price Cardano saw brief recovery above $0.48 last week, but the cryptocurrency has since witnessed a retrace as its price is now back at $0.40.

Bitcoin started a fresh decline from the $90,500 zone. The price is trading below $88,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $89,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it settles above the $85,000 zone. Bitcoin Price Dips Further Bitcoin price failed to gain strength for a move above the $90,000 and $90,500 levels. BTC started a fresh decline and traded below the $88,500 support. The price even spiked below the $87,000 support. However, the bulls were active near the $85,000 zone. A low was formed at $85,151 and the price is consolidating gains below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $93,560 swing high to the $85,151 low.

Immediate resistance is near the $87,150 level. The first key resistance is near the $87,500 level. The next resistance could be $88,000. A close above the $88,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $89,000 resistance. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $89,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Any more gains might send the price toward the $90,000 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $91,000 and $91,500. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $87,000 resistance zone, it could start another decline.

    "body": "Shiba Inu has kept a spot in crypto talk even as its price has slid sharply. According to reports, the network had a market cap of $5 billion as of Dec. 6, and it still draws attention because people know the name. That visibility, however, does not settle the debate over whether the token belongs in a long-term portfolio. Related Reading: Bitcoin Headed For $200 Trillion? CEO Makes Bold Prediction Shiba Inu’s Price And Market Size Based on reports, Shiba Inu has seen massive moves over several years. Roughly five years ago it traded near $0.0000000001684; at the time of writing, it is quoted at about $0.000008439. SHIB’s all-time high stands at $0.00008845, which means the token trades roughly 85% below that peak. Reports have disclosed that SHIB has tanked about 55% so far this year, and some data points show almost a 60% decline over a recent 12-month span. Those drops have pushed many investors to ask whether the story that once lifted SHIB has faded. On-Chain Signals And Holder Counts There are mixed signals on the chain. Data from CryptoQuant is reported to show memecoin dominance falling to its lowest level since early 2024, a sign that speculative interest across similar tokens has ebbed. At the same time, the number of wallets holding SHIB moved from about 1.45 million at the start of the year to around 1.52 million more recently. That jump in holders was noted alongside the price slide. It suggests distribution rather than complete abandonment; small increases in holders do not always mean increased trading activity, but they can show steady retail interest. Memecoin markets are dead. pic.twitter.com/6kymLWH4JX — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 11, 2025 Pundit Views And The Utility Question Meanwhile, crypto pundit Neil Patel has listed reasons he would not treat Shiba Inu as a proper investment. He argues the memecoin doesn’t solve a clear, large-scale problem and points out that developer activity for SHIB is limited compared with many other networks. The claim is that much of SHIB’s value has been driven by hype cycles and not by broad real-world use. Those views were presented in firm terms, and they have been repeated across a range of commentaries that warn about hype-driven tokens. Related Reading: Analyst: Bitcoin’s Cycle Is Intact, Yet No Longer Purely Market-Driven Investor Takeaways And Risks Investors who want exposure to crypto are often told to look at major networks such as Bitcoin for scarcity-driven arguments; that point was brought up in several reports. At the same time, SHIB’s supporting projects — a layer-two chain, a decentralized exchange, a metaverse concept — are real but appear to have small adoption so far.

    "title": "Cardano Targets $10.40 As ‘2020 Blastoff’ Pattern Returns, Analyst Says",
    "body": "Cardano (ADA) is getting the “2020 blastoff” treatment again — at least if you ask Quantum Ascend, a technical analyst on X who says the chart is starting to rhyme with the setup that preceded ADA’s last major run. In a Dec. 13 video shared on X, Quantum Ascend (@quantum_ascend) told followers he’s been working through a longer-term weekly count and thinks the market may be grinding toward the end of a drawn-out corrective structure. The punchline: a “conservative” target zone around $4.88–$5.50, and a “primary” bull-run target of $10.40. “Cardano Mirroring 2020 Blastoff Moment,” his post read, before laying out the two tiers: “Conservative: $4.88-$5.50” and “Primary: $10.40.” The Framework Behind The Cardano Price Prediction The framework he’s leaning on isn’t a clean five-wave impulse, he said. Instead, he framed it as something slower and messier — “more of like a large time-based macro correction here on the D-wave,” he said, describing what he believes is a triangle structure developing on the weekly chart. “We’re creating a triangle structure,” he said. “So I am going to be looking for the E-wave. That’s what ends up coming next.” Related Reading: Cardano’s December Slide Intensifies: What’s Driving the Decline and What Comes Next? A big part of the argument is confluence. Quantum Ascend walked through multiple measurements and trendlines, pointing to price zones where different tools cluster. One reference point was a prior A-to-B drawdown range that, in his view, still hasn’t been fully “closed out,” with a key level “up there at the $5.50 mark.” Then he zoomed out to the bigger structure, highlighting how an upper trendline from a C-to-D drawdown “converges with the 3.618 [Fibonacci extension] up here,” which he suggested adds weight to the $10 area. “So some confluence for that $10 area,” he said, pointing at the chart level he called out around $10.62. He also reached for a relative-performance comparison — not to Ethereum itself, but to Ethereum Classic. “I have another video from the past that compares Ethereum Classic to ADA,” he said. “And if it ends up doing a similar move to Ethereum Classic, that also puts us up into the $10 range.” Still, the near-term “safe” target he kept circling back to was the $5 region. After walking through a more recent drawdown “going back to the top of the Trump pump to where we’re at now,” he said a “full extension gets us pretty close… around $4.88,” adding that the $5 zone shows “a lot of different signs of confluence.” “For me, I’m going to say my conservative estimate for ADA is going to be that $5 range,” he said. Then he went straight to the headline number: “I think ADA gets up there around 10 bucks during this bull run.” To make the comparison feel less abstract, Quantum Ascend argued the current chop looks structurally similar to a prior period before ADA’s last breakout — a fractal-style read. “You guys notice the similarities here?” he asked, describing how both moves get “stopped out a little bit above the 0.5,” roll over, then revisit the lower trendline before pushing back to the top of the range.

    "title": "Solana Leads As Most Popular Blockchain Ecosystem For Second Consecutive Year – Report",
    "body": "Solana (SOL) has emerged as the most popular blockchain ecosystem of 2025, securing its crown for the second consecutive year despite a significant decrease in chain-specific global interest compared to the previous year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signals Are ‘Hard To Ignore’: Analyst Warns Of Drop To April Lows Solana Takes The Popularity Crown On Monday, Solana was named the leading blockchain ecosystem by popularity in 2025 by crypto data aggregator CoinGecko. The study examined interest in blockchain ecosystems based on CoinGecko’s non-botted global web traffic from January 1 to December 14, 2025, only including ecosystems with actively listed coins and a non-zero percentage share of traffic. As a result, a total of 62 blockchain ecosystems were included in the study. Out of the 62 blockchain ecosystems studied, the 20 most popular represented a majority of 95.60% of global interest in chain-specific narratives. According to the report, the Solana ecosystem captured 26.79% of the global interest in chain-specific narratives this year, retaining its title as the most popular blockchain ecosystem for a second consecutive year. The Base ecosystem followed in second place, accounting for 13.94% of global investor interest in chain-specific narratives this year, led by constructive developments and partnerships. However, its mindshare experienced a 2.9% decrease from the 16.81% recorded in 2024. Similar to Solana and Base, the Ethereum ecosystem also retained its position from the 2024 list, ranking as the third most popular ecosystem with 13.43% of global interest. Meanwhile, Sui and BNB Chain moved up in the list, ranking 4th and 5th after more than doubling their mindshare in 2025. Per the study, the Sui ecosystem recorded the largest mindshare growth, with a 6.9% year-over-year (YoY) increase to reach 11.77% of the total global interest in chain-specific narratives. The BNB Chain ecosystem saw a 4.9% surge YoY to capture 9.05% in mindshare, fueled by the launch of Binance Alpha in May, which increased BNB Chain’s on-chain trading volumes, the report noted. Notably, XRP Ledger, Bittensor & Hyperliquid lead new entrants into the top rankings, securing a spot in the top 10 this year. SOL Memecoins Out Of Leading Narratives Despite leading the popularity rankings, CoinGecko highlighted that the Solana ecosystem’s mindshare had significantly decreased from the 38.79% it had dominated in 2024. According to the study, the ecosystem dropped by 12% this year, reflecting the blockchain’s “struggles to expand beyond its close association with meme coin speculation, as well as Solana’s range-bound price despite wider institutional adoption marked by the US ETFs launch.” This resulted in the Solana ecosystem dropping out of the top leading narratives list this year. In a Friday analysis, CoinGecko reported that memecoin emerged as the most popular crypto narrative in 2025 with a combined 25.02% of global investor interest across the main meme coin category and 35 meme coin trends. This represented a 5.65% decline from the 30.67% market share that the memecoin narrative held in 2024, suggesting that “the mania for purely speculative crypto may be subsiding.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds The Solana ecosystem lost its spot in the top five most popular crypto narratives, where it had ranked for the previous two years, after being overtaken by AI agents and the Made in USA narratives. Meanwhile, the Solana memecoin sector also dropped out of the top five narratives after a 3.08% decline in global investor interest from 2024. Nonetheless, “it remains to be seen whether the Solana narrative will be able to ride on new catalysts next year, as momentum from its comeback story runs out,” CoinGecko added. As of this writing, SOL is trading at $126, a 2.61% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Price Forecast: Key Factors That Could Propel It To $3 In Early 2026",
    "body": "As the week began, the XRP price experienced a 4% decline, bringing it nearly 50% below its all-time highs. However, analysts forecast significant gains for one of the market’s leading altcoins in January 2026, citing three major catalysts that could reshape its market outlook. A Major Step Towards Broader Access In a recent analysis, Sam Daodu, a market expert from 24/7 Wall St., emphasized the importance of Vanguard’s decision to approve trading of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Daodu emphasized that the real significance lies in the facilitation of distribution; with Vanguard’s advisors able to allocate XRP exposure through regulated ETFs without additional cumbersome processes. He indicated that three interrelated factors are now at play: the influx of institutional capital through ETF investments, a reduction in supply, and the influence of Vanguard in altering the approach towards the asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pulls Back Under $89K, Michael Saylor Smells Opportunity Notably, the results of the token’s exchange-traded fund launch have already been notable, with XRP inflows hitting $1 billion within the first four weeks of trading, making it one of the fastest-growing crypto ETF launches to date. Additionally, XRP’s market supply has contracted significantly, dropping by 45% from approximately 3.9 billion tokens at the beginning of 2025 to about 1.6 billion by December. This contraction can be attributed to large holders refraining from distributing their tokens, leading to an accumulation in whale wallets and the removal of tokens from liquid markets due to ETF custody. This decreased supply implies that smaller inflows now carry greater influence. With only 1.6 billion tokens available on exchanges, investments of $20-30 million in daily ETF purchases can have a substantive impact on market supply. A Key Driver For Price Appreciation The Vanguard XRP ETF launch is particularly significant in this context, as it locks tokens into regulated custody vehicles that are less likely to be sold frequently. Unlike tokens held on exchanges that can be quickly moved in and out, ETF custody tends to encourage a buy-and-hold strategy, fostering conditions for gradual price appreciation fueled by sustained institutional demand amid a diminishing available supply. Given that the decision to provide ETF access came late in the year, year-end trading typically focuses on maintaining existing allocations rather than creating new positions. While the ETF adds credibility to XRP without causing immediate price pressure, its journey to a $3 valuation by January will depend on how swiftly advisory capital mobilizes, the durability of supply compression, and the overall stability of the markets. XRP Price Path To $3 Three potential scenarios present themselves for XRP’s future. The most optimistic scenario sees advisory capital moving quicker than typical, perhaps allowing advisors to integrate small XRP allocations during January’s rebalancing. In this case, XRP ETF inflows could remain robust, ranging from $40-60 million daily, while the locked-up supply on exchanges supports a price increase that could see the XRP price surpass $2.25, aim for $2.60, and potentially test $3 by the end of January. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Compression Deepens as Analysts Debate if the Next Move Is a Rally or Breakdown The middle-ground perspective suggests a more conventional institutional timing. In this scenario, while the XRP ETF access will gain attention in December, actual allocations might ramp up gradually, leading to a daily influx of about $20-30 million instead of the earlier expected pace. Here, the XRP price could establish higher lows and breach the $2.25 mark, facing resistance between $2.40 and $2.80. Price fluctuations would focus more on future adoption rather than immediate implications. According to Daodu’s conclusions, and given these circumstances, the XRP price reaching $3 could take until the first or second quarter of 2026 rather than being an immediate milestone.

    "title": "Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund",
    "body": "JPMorgan Asset Management has introduced a tokenized money-market fund built on the Ethereum blockchain, according to company filings and industry reports. The fund, called My OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY), issues shares as digital tokens that live on the public Ethereum network and are aimed at qualified investors through the bank’s Morgan Money platform. Related Reading: Analyst: Bitcoin’s Cycle Is Intact, Yet No Longer Purely Market-Driven JPMorgan Issues Tokenized Fund On Ethereum Based on reports, MONY holds familiar, low-risk instruments such as US Treasury securities and repurchase agreements fully backed by Treasuries. The bank says the token shares represent direct ownership of the fund and can be held at blockchain addresses, opening up on-chain settlement and recordkeeping for a product that normally sits in traditional custody systems. Seeded With $100 Million Reports have disclosed that JPMorgan seeded MONY with $100 million of its own capital at launch. The move is meant to kickstart liquidity and show institutional seriousness about putting cash management products on-chain. The tokenization work is being handled by internal teams tied to JPMorgan’s digital-assets efforts, and the bank has been testing ways to move conventional securities into token form for several years. How The Tokens Work And Who Can Use Them Investors receive tokenized fund shares that may be transferred or recorded on Ethereum. Based on reports, access is limited: the fund is offered only to qualified clients via Morgan Money, not to the general retail public. The token structure mirrors traditional fund economics — holders are exposed to the same short-term instruments that underpin money-market products — but the record of ownership is stored on a public ledger. Related Reading: Bitcoin Headed For $200 Trillion? CEO Makes Bold Prediction Qualified Investors And Access According to coverage, institutional clients with asset levels above $25 million and accredited individuals with at least $5 million are among those eligible, and the minimum initial investment sits at roughly $1 million. That narrow access aligns with regulatory guardrails for tokenized securities and with the bank’s goal of serving big, sophisticated cash managers first. Analysts say the launch is part of a broader push by big asset managers to experiment with tokenized share classes and on-chain settlement. Other firms have run pilots with similar ideas, and some have already put cash-like products on Ethereum. Based on reports, the move points to an industry desire to test whether blockchain can speed up settlement, increase transparency, or create new on-chain liquidity for institutional cash flows.

    "title": "Will Bitcoin Suffer A 20% Decline After Japan’s Rate Hike? Historical Patterns Suggest So",
    "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a 4% drop, falling below the $86,000 mark on Monday, as market speculation grows regarding the cryptocurrency’s future following the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) interest rate decision. In a recent poll conducted from December 2 to 9, an overwhelming 90% of economists—63 out of 70—predicted that the BOJ would increase short-term interest rates from 0.50% to 0.75% at this week’s planned meeting. Experts Warn Of Impact From BOJ Rate Hikes Experts on social media have noted a concerning trend: during the last three rate hikes by the BOJ, Bitcoin has typically dropped significantly. The statistics reveal the following declines: a 23% drop in March 2024, a 26% decline in July 2024, and a 31% dip in January of this year. Related Reading: Why XRP Isn’t Reacting to Major Institutional and Regional Developments Based on current prices just below $86,000, this would imply that if the cryptocurrency sees another 20% correction, it could drop all the way to 68,800. This would mean extending the gap compared to the all-time high of $126,000 by almost 46%. The group of experts further highlighted that the dynamics at play in Japan significantly impact Bitcoin’s performance as Japan holds the largest amount of US debt of any nation. When Japanese interest rates rise, capital tends to flow back to Japan, leading to reduced liquidity in dollars. This decrease in dollar liquidity often results in the selling of riskier assets like Bitcoin. On November 30, a foreboding sign of this potential downturn appeared when confirmation of Japan’s impending rate hike caused Bitcoin to dip to around $83,000, erasing approximately $200 billion from the overall cryptocurrency market. However, the bearish sentiment affecting Bitcoin is not solely the result of Japan’s actions. Market analyst known as NoLimit recently pointed to another critical factor: China’s renewed crackdown on Bitcoin mining. China’s Mining Crackdown Spurs Bitcoin Sell-Off The analyst recently asserted that China has tightened regulations, particularly affecting operations in Xinjiang, where a significant number of crypto mining setups were shut down in December. This led to the abrupt offline status of roughly 400,000 miners. The repercussions of such a sudden shift in mining activity are already evident. The Bitcoin network hashrate has fallen by about 8%, indicating that fewer miners are actively contributing to the network. NoLimit suggests that this sudden reduction creates immediate revenue-loss for miners, who may need to liquidate Bitcoin to cover operational costs or to relocate their equipment. Consequently, this generates actual selling pressure on the market, contributing to the downward price trend seen on Monday. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Compression Deepens as Analysts Debate if the Next Move Is a Rally or Breakdown Despite the short-term pain this creates, the analysts clarified that it does not indicate a long-term bearish outlook for Bitcoin. Instead, he views it as a temporary supply shock driven by regulatory decisions rather than a shift in demand. Historical patterns support this notion: when China has previously cracked down on miners, the cycle follows a familiar trajectory: miners are forced offline, hashrate dips occur, prices fluctuate, and eventually, the network adapts before Bitcoin moves forward again.

    "title": "US Bitcoin Session Leads December Returns After Weak November",
    "body": "Data shows Bitcoin has witnessed a notable amount of gains during the US trading session in December so far, a shift compared to the November trend. Bitcoin Has Performed The Best During US Trading Session This Month As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the American trading session has flipped for Bitcoin in December. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn, which compares the returns that BTC has achieved across the different trading sessions over the past month. The trading sessions here have been divided based on when investors of a major market are typically active. Bitcoin and other blockchain-based assets run 24/7, so there naturally isn’t ever a time in any timezone where trading is inactive. However, investors do still tend to trade more actively during their daytime, which is what these sessions are based on. From the chart, it’s visible that cumulative Bitcoin returns were negative for the American trading session during the last couple of weeks of November. Europe and Asia-Pacific didn’t perform much better, but they at least saw close to neutral returns. Related Reading: Cardano SuperTrend Turns Bearish—Last Signal Preceded 80% ADA Drop Toward the end of November, though, a shift began to take shape, with returns during US hours going up. And in this month of December so far, the trading session has pulled away from the rest, with cumulative returns sitting at a positive 8%. In contrast, Europe and Asia-Pacific have the metric at a level of around -4% or lower. Thus, if the cumulative returns during these sessions are anything to go by, it would appear that American investors have been participating in Bitcoin accumulation this month, while the others have been distributing or simply, not buying. In some other news, the Bitcoin selloff last month caused a key on-chain indicator to go through its largest negative change in years, as quant Frank has pointed out in an X post. The metric displayed in the chart is the Realized Price of the Bitcoin short-term holders. This indicator measures the average cost basis of investors on the BTC network. The version listed in the graph specifically tracks the cost basis of short-term holders (STHs), entities who entered the market over the last 155 days. As is visible in the chart, the Bitcoin STH Realized Price saw a notable decline alongside the price crash in the cryptocurrency during November. This suggests investors who bought at higher levels panic capitulated, repricing their coins to the lower post-plunge levels. Related Reading: XRP Mildly Undervalued On MVRV: What About Bitcoin, Ethereum? This capitulation was so strong that the STH Realized Price saw its largest red 7-day change since the FTX crash back in November 2022. BTC Price Bitcoin has witnessed bearish price action during the past day as its price has come down to $85,800 following a drop of about 3.5%.

    "title": "XRP Hasn’t Entered A Bear Market Yet; Analyst Shares Why",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Dark Defender has been one of the most vocal supporters of XRP, and this stance has not changed despite the altcoin’s current price action. If anything, the analyst believes that the current downtrend actually plays into the XRP long-term target, claiming that the cryptocurrency remains inherently bullish. If the analyst is right, then it means that the XRP price could be gearing up for another major uptrend that could send it to new peaks. XRP Price Is Only In Wave 4, Not A Bear Market In the post that was shared on X, Dark Defender explained that the XRP cryptocurrency was not in any kind of bear market. Instead, the current downtrend is only a result of the altcoin entering Wave 4 of the Elliot Wave, leading to the decline. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Still Hit $140,000? What The Global M2 Money Supply Says Given that Wave 4 is a historically bearish wave, it would explain why the XRP price has dropped so quickly. However, the crypto analyst explained that this wave did not just start, as it has been in play since February 2025. Hence, it would need to play out completely before the next wave can begin. Going by this analysis, it would mean that the last and final wave of the theory is yet to play out, which is often the most bullish of all the waves. As a result, the analyst urges XRP investors not to panic as the price continues to play out according to plan. In the end, the target remains $5.85, according to Dark Defender, beating its previous all-time high of $3.8. Price Could Be Rounding A Bottom Another analyst also contributes that the XRP price is not in a bear market, and could, in fact, be putting in a bottom. STEPH IS CRYPTO points out that the XRP RSI is actually showing a rare bullish divergence on the daily chart, one of the few times that this has happened over the years. Related Reading: Why Did The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP Prices Crash, And Will It Continue? This is significant because back in 2022, a similar bullish divergence had appeared on the daily chart ,and the result was a rapid rise once the distribution was done. As the crypto analyst explains, the fact that this bullish RSI divergence has appeared on the XRP daily chart again suggests that the sellers are actually running out of steam. While there is no set target for where the XRP price is headed, the prediction suggests that a rally could be in the works. “Nothing is guaranteed — but from a technical perspective, this is one of the strongest early reversal signals you can get,” the analyst stated.

    "title": "Dogecoin RSI Hits Levels That Have Triggered ATH Rallies Before",
    "body": "Dogecoin’s weekly price chart is revealing an interesting event of an important momentum indicator hitting a level that has always been a major turning point for the cryptocurrency. After spending the past several weeks falling lower into the $0.13 price region, Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index on the weekly timeframe has reached levels that have only appeared a handful of times over the asset’s entire trading history. The observation, first highlighted by crypto analyst Cryptollica, revisits how Dogecoin has behaved the last few times this technical condition happened. A Rare Weekly RSI Signal In Dogecoin’s History Technical analysis indicates that Dogecoin’s weekly Relative Strength Index has dropped into a narrow zone around the 33 level, a condition that has appeared only four times over roughly eleven years of trading history. Each of those occasions aligned with periods where selling pressure had largely run its course, even though price action itself did not immediately reverse. Instead, these phases were marked by quiet accumulation. Related Reading: XRP Dominates Institutional Inflows, But Why Is Price Still Low? The Dogecoin chart highlights these moments clearly, with pronounced RSI dips into the lower band during 2015, 2020, and 2022. In each case, price followed a similar script: extended basing ranges formed after the RSI reached this level, laying the groundwork for the next sustained advance. Now in late 2025, Dogecoin’s RSI is again exhibiting this same structural behavior, and this places the current price action in a way that might play out bullish. Short-term oversold readings are relatively common as reversal indicators, but they often produce false starts. However, since this is on the weekly timeframe, this specific setup tends to emerge only during broader market resets and is much more reliable. During those resets, the RSI stabilized and rebounded from the 30 to 33 zone as price gradually transitioned from consolidation into a new uptrend. Dogecoin Price Chart. Source: @Cryptollica On X What The Current RSI Setup Could Mean Going Forward As of mid-December 2025, Dogecoin is trading in the low-$0.13 to mid-$0.14 range, having slipped back below $0.14 that had been acting as short-term support in recent weeks. This price area has been volatile, with moves between roughly $0.13 and about $0.15, reflecting an ongoing struggle between buyers and sellers and a lack of decisive bullish momentum. The sellers are winning right now, with Dogecoin trading at $0.13, down by 5% in the past 24 hours and about to lose this price level. Related Reading: Silk Road Bitcoins Are On The Move Again, Is The BTC Price Ready For Another Dump? Nonetheless, the weekly RSI that’s currently at the usually significant zone adds additional context. It proposes a scenario where Dogecoin is about to reach a price bottom and buyers regain control in the coming weeks. However, considering that this is a weekly indicator, Dogecoin’s price action might continue to consolidate around this level for the next few weeks before any meaningful bounce takes place.

Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Breakdown Below Key Support Shifts Short-Term Structure In the past 24 hours, Dogecoin (DOGE) fell about 5.5%, sliding from roughly $0.1367 to near $0.129, and briefly trading as low as $0.1266. The drop pushed the price below the $0.1370 and $0.1300 support zones, levels that had defined the lower boundary of its recent range. Trading volume surged to around 1.36 billion tokens, more than 180% above average, suggesting the move was driven by active selling rather than gradual drift. Technically, DOGE is now trading below its 100-hour simple moving average, with a bearish trend line forming near $0.1340. Attempts to reclaim $0.1300 have so far failed, reinforcing that level as immediate resistance. Market participants note that once intermediate supports gave way, bid depth appeared thin, allowing the DOGE price to move lower with limited pauses. Sentiment Signals Clash With Weak Dogecoin Price Action Despite the selloff, Dogecoin remains a popular online presence. The official Dogecoin ecosystem account recently acknowledged renewed public endorsements, including comments from a high-profile entrepreneur, and resurfaced cultural callbacks tied to DOGE’s 2021 run. From a positioning standpoint, Dogecoin remains significantly below its all-time high and has declined sharply on a year-to-date basis. Open interest has also declined significantly from earlier 2025 peaks, pointing to reduced speculative participation. For some traders, this is evidence of capitulation; for others, it signals a quieter phase where excess leverage and hype are being flushed out. Levels That Now Matter for Traders In the near term, market focus is centered on the $0.1290–$0.1280 zone. Holding above this area could allow DOGE to consolidate, while a sustained break lower may expose support near $0.1250 and potentially the $0.1200 region. On the upside, a reclaim of $0.1300 would be the first indication that downside momentum is easing, though former supports above $0.1340 remain key hurdles.

For now, Dogecoin remains in a fragile stabilization phase, where confirmation, rather than conviction, is driving trading decisions. Cover image from ChatGPT, DOGEUSD chart from Tradingview",

    "title": "Private Investment Firm Shares Why XRP Is Their Leading Investment",
    "body": "A private investment firm has outlined why XRP constitutes the largest share of its portfolio. The firm explains that its investment rationale is anchored in XRP’s Proven operational performance and functional utility rather than aspirational projections, community momentum, or speculative price expectations. As a result, the position reflects a deliberate focus on infrastructure value, reinforcing XRP’s status as a core long-term holding rather than a tactical crypto trade. Why XRP Aligns With A Function-First Investment Approach The investment firm’s reasoning positions XRP as a natural fit for a portfolio strategy that prioritizes function over narrative. According to the firm, its heavy allocation is the byproduct of a disciplined evaluation of how well an asset performs its intended role. In this framework, concentration is justified only when an asset demonstrates clear operational strengths, and XRP is presented as having earned that status through its design and execution. Related Reading: Why Now Is The Perfect Opportunity To Short Bitcoin Down To $40,000 Building on that premise, the firm points to XRP’s specialization as a settlement-oriented digital asset as the primary driver of its allocation decision. The network is structured to deliver rapid and definitive transaction completion, eliminating the uncertainty that can complicate value transfer on many blockchain systems. This reliability is reinforced by consistently low transaction costs that remain stable regardless of usage levels, enabling predictable large-scale transfers without exposure to fee volatility. As transaction volume increases, XRP’s ability to maintain high throughput without congestion further supports its suitability for continuous, real-world payment activity. These technical attributes also connect directly to the firm’s broader investment thesis around institutional usability. By operating without a proof-of-work mechanism, the ledger avoids the inefficiencies and regulatory friction often associated with energy-intensive networks. In the firm’s assessment, this design choice enhances operational clarity and aligns more closely with the compliance and efficiency standards expected by financial institutions. Taken together, these factors explain why the firm views XRP less as a speculative vehicle and more as functional infrastructure, reinforcing its alignment with a function-first investment approach and justifying its central role within the portfolio. Positioning For Institutional Adoption And Market Repricing The firm frames its investment thesis around how markets evolve under regulatory pressure. As digital asset regulation advances, financial institutions are expected to prioritize reliability, compliance, and operational efficiency over popularity or community momentum. Adoption is therefore driven less by attention and more by seamless integration into existing financial frameworks. Related Reading: Here’s Why Strategy’s $1 Billion Bitcoin Purchase Did Not Trigger A Price Rally This perspective also informs how digital assets may be valued. The firm expects a gradual shift from narrative-based pricing toward metrics such as transaction throughput, liquidity efficiency, and real-world demand. Assets able to move value at scale will likely be repriced as usage rises and speculative excess fades. In the firm’s assessment, XRP is one of the few assets already meeting these standards, and by concentrating its portfolio in XRP, it positions itself ahead of this transition.

    "title": "Ethereum 2-Year Trend Maps Out This Unique Crash Path To Bottom At $2,187",
    "body": "Ethereum’s price action has weakened further over the past 24 hours, with the cryptocurrency falling below $3,000 and shedding about 6.8% in the last 24 hours alone. The immediate price action points to reclaiming this $3,000 support, but a longer-term technical view suggests the current decline may be part of a much larger and more defined price framework. A macro analysis shared by crypto analyst Dona examines Ethereum’s behavior over the past two years with a structured range that suggests that the cryptocurrency might bottom at $2,187. Ethereum’s Two-Year Range Still Defines The Bigger Picture According to the analysis, Ethereum has largely traded within a broad horizontal range for close to two years, aside from two notable fakeouts: one below resistance in the first half of 2025 and one above resistance in the second half of the year, which led to a new price high of $4,946 in August. On the weekly timeframe, price has repeatedly respected an upper boundary around $4,000 to $4,100, while finding consistent demand near the lower range support just above $2,100. Related Reading: Industry Leader Shares Why Ethereum Price Will Reach $12,000 This price action has resulted in a structure that resembles an inverse head and shoulders pattern on a macro scale. Instead of signaling immediate upside, however, the formation shows how price has oscillated between these defined trendlines, with mid-range reactions often determining whether Ethereum pushes to resistance or slips back toward support. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading within the mid-range of the two-year range. Based on this context, the recent bearish move can be viewed less as a breakdown and more as a rotation towards the lower trendline within the same long-standing range. Why $2,187 Stands Out As A Critical Downside Target The chart accompanying the analysis places particular emphasis on the lower boundary of the range near $2,187. This level has repeatedly acted as a bounce floor during prior downtrends in 2024 and another one in July 2025. Related Reading: What’s Happening With The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Recently? If Ethereum continues to trade below the mid-range support currently around $3,000, then the price could follow a familiar range rotation path toward this lower boundary. This move will see Ethereum fall to as low as $2,187. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,928, and is still a 25% decline away from $2,187. Although this would be tragic for bullish traders, such a move would not necessarily invalidate the broader structure. Instead, it will complete another cycle within the range, similar to previous declines that eventually transitioned into a bounce for a rally phase. One of the more notable aspects of the outlook from Dona is the expectation for subdued activity in the near term. Aside from range-bound trades, taking directional positions may be less attractive as liquidity thins into the end of the year. From this perspective, the next major move is more likely to arrive in January 2026. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "ADA Enters Critical Phase as Cardano Price Slips Back to Multi-Year Support Levels",
    "body": "Cardano’s ADA token has returned to a familiar but uncomfortable zone. After months of lower highs and failed recovery attempts, the price has slid back toward long-term support levels that have defined its structure for more than two years. Related Reading: XRP Hasn’t Entered A Bear Market Yet; Analyst Shares Why The move comes amid a broader market pullback, as risk appetite weakens across equities and crypto, but ADA’s decline is also being shaped by internal technical signals that traders are finding hard to ignore. ADA currently trades near $0.38–$0.39, down approximately 5.57% over the past 24 hours. That drop places the token close to a multi-year ascending support trend line that has held for nearly 900 days. ADA's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Derivatives and Positioning Point to Caution Market data indicate that traders are stepping back rather than leaning into the decline. Futures open interest in ADA has decreased by approximately 11% to around $670 million, indicating that positions are being closed rather than expanded. Funding rates have also softened, with more than 55% of tracked positions now skewed to the short side. Together, these metrics point to reduced confidence in a near-term rebound and a market that is positioning defensively. This caution is not isolated to Cardano. Altcoins across the board have come under pressure as investors adopt a risk-off stance ahead of key U.S. macroeconomic data, including inflation and labor reports, and as concerns surrounding the AI sector spill over into correlated assets like cryptocurrency. Technical Structure Near a Breaking Point On the charts, ADA’s structure remains fragile. The token recently lost the $0.53 horizontal support, confirming a bearish shift on higher timeframes. Momentum indicators reflect that change. The RSI is below 50, and the MACD remains in a negative position. Recent price action looks corrective rather than impulsive, suggesting the latest bounce may already have run its course. ADA is still hovering near its long-term diagonal support, but a clean breakdown would likely alter the outlook materially. Some analysts warn that, if this trend line fails, the price could retrace much deeper, potentially toward levels last seen during the previous bear market. Long-Term Targets Contrast With Short-Term Risk Despite the weak near-term picture, longer-term projections remain divided. One technical analyst has argued that ADA’s current consolidation resembles a prolonged corrective phase similar to the setup seen before its 2020 breakout, outlining upside targets ranging from the $5 area to above $10 in a full bull scenario. Related Reading: US Bitcoin Session Leads December Returns After Weak November However, those views hinge on the market first stabilizing and reclaiming key resistance zones. For now, ADA’s focus is simpler. The token is at a critical phase, with long-term support under pressure and sentiment cautious. Whether this level marks a base or a breakdown will likely shape Cardano’s trajectory into 2026. Cover image from ChatGPT, ADAUSD chart from Tradingview",
