    "title": "$4M On The Move: Libra Scandal Addresses Make A Surprising Solana Play",
    "body": "Libra-linked wallets quietly pulled roughly $4 million from a failing memecoin and used part of their stash to pile into Solana, according to on-chain tracking and news reports. Related Reading: Crypto Carnage Continues — Tom Lee Exposes What’s Really Going On The move comes amid fraud probes and renewed scrutiny of the token’s launch, which earlier this year saw large withdrawals that rocked investor confidence and drew legal attention. Wallets Rotate Funds Into Solana Based on on-chain data, two addresses tied to the Libra project — labeled “Libra Deployer (Defcy)” and “Libra Wallet (61yKS)” — bought about $61.5 million worth of SOL at an average price near $135. Before these purchases, the same addresses reportedly held roughly $57 million in USDC, enabling a quick rotation from stablecoin holdings into a major Layer-1 token. Blockchain analysts flagged the activity after tracing a string of transfers that drained the last remaining liquidity from the token’s market. The withdrawals of nearly $4 million followed earlier large cash-outs tied to the coin’s creators that investigators say removed as much as $99 million from circulation at the token’s launch. That wave of exits and the token’s sudden collapse prompted several probes in Argentina and the US. What The Purchases Mean For Markets Market watchers said the swap into SOL is notable because it moves money from a controversial, politically linked memecoin into a mainstream crypto asset. Meanwhile, the political angle has not faded. The Libra token’s launch drew attention after Argentine President Javier Milei publicly promoted the coin and then tried to distance himself as losses mounted. The broader pattern of meme tokens tied to politicians has raised fresh worries about transparency and investor protection, with some lawmakers and regulators taking a closer look. Legal And Control Questions Remain Reports have asked who finally controls the wallets now and whether authorities can freeze the new SOL holdings. Fraud investigations are active, but on-chain moves show the addresses retained control long enough to shift assets across chains.

The episode adds to a string of high-profile memecoin blowups tied to public figures.

    "title": "Dogecoin Price Could Surge Above $1 As It Repeats This Trend From 2023-2024",
    "body": "The Dogecoin price may be poised for a significant rebound, as a familiar long-term pattern has emerged on its chart. According to technical analysis, the structure looks almost identical to a setup that triggered a major breakout in its previous cycle, from 2023 to 2024. With Dogecoin currently at a crucial support level that once marked the start of its last sustained rally, a crypto analyst has projected that the meme coin could enter a new bullish phase, potentially driving it above $1. Past Pattern Foreshadows Dogecoin Price Surge To $1 Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has predicted that the Dogecoin price could soon surge to $1.10 from its current $0.15 in this cycle. In a recent X post, he highlighted that Dogecoin’s weekly chart has settled on its support trendline for the third time in the current 2021-2026 cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Cup And Handle Pattern Is Returning, What Happens To Price If It’s Completed? The chart shows DOGE’s price reaching this key level after a prolonged pullback, creating a structure similar to the one that formed in late 2023. At the time, this pattern marked the beginning of a slow but consistent uptrend that lasted throughout 2024, ultimately creating the meme coin’s mid-cycle range peak. The historical comparison between the 2023 – 2024 cycle and the current cycle is clear on the analyst’s chart. In the previous cycle, Dogecoin completed three closes at the support zone before sharply reversing upward. The latest weekly pattern mirrors the exact alignment, with price tightening around a rising trendline while forming higher lows. Trader Tardigrade also noted that the previous cycle’s slow bull run began from the same setup. Notably, the chart highlights a large boxed region representing the projected 2024 to 2025 phase, where a widening price structure suggests that Dogecoin could still have room for an upward move. If historical patterns repeat as expected, the meme coin could initiate another powerful leg up above $1 by 2026. Dogecoin’s Bullish Thesis Strengthens After Channel Break Trader Tardigrade has also highlighted an important improvement on Dogecoin’s lower-timeframe chart, indicating a shift from a downtrend. The two-hour chart setup reveals a breakout from a Descending Channel that had previously controlled price movements during the meme coin’s recent decline. The breakout is visible as the white price line pushes above the Descending Channel’s upper boundary, signaling a potential shift in short-term momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Bounce Very Quickly If This Happens At $0.166 According to Trader Tardigrade, technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) support this shift. While the RSI has broken above its resistance zone, the MACD histogram shows a buildup in positive momentum, with bars expanding upward. The analyst has explained that Dogecoin often begins its largest bull rallies with early signals on the LTF before spreading to the higher time frames. With momentum rising, Trader Tardigrade believes the DOGE price may already be initiating an uptrend. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Capitulation Deepens Around $90K Level: Classic Late-Stage Fear Structure Emerging",
    "body": "Bitcoin is trading at critical price levels as the market enters one of its most tense and uncertain stages of the year. The crypto market is showing clear signs of stress, and new data from CryptoQuant confirms that Bitcoin is now moving into one of the most severe short-term capitulation phases of this cycle. According to the latest on-chain metrics, short-term holders (STHs) are realizing losses at a scale typically seen only near major market turning points. Related Reading: XRP Supply In Profit Falls to 58.5% – Lowest Since 2024 Despite Higher Price The key indicator driving this analysis is STH-SOPR, which has plunged to deeply depressed readings around 0.97. This means STHs are selling coins at a clear loss, often driven by fear rather than strategy. Even more importantly, this metric has spent several consecutive weeks below the critical 1.0 threshold, forming what analysts refer to as a structural “capitulation band.” Historically, whenever STH-SOPR remained under 1.0 for extended periods, it signaled heavy emotional selling—typically from the most reactive and least informed market participants. These episodes have repeatedly aligned with late-stage corrections, market reversals, and shifts in long-term holder dominance. With Bitcoin now sitting at a crucial technical and psychological zone, the next phase could determine whether this becomes a deeper bear trend or a major reset before recovery. Short-Term Holders Under Extreme Stress as Capitulation Deepens According to XWIN Research on CryptoQuant, the current selloff is being amplified by the behavior of short-term holders, with the STH-MVRV ratio now sitting far below 1.0. This indicates that nearly all recent buyers are holding Bitcoin at a loss, placing short-term profitability in one of the weakest conditions in the entire dataset. Historically, these deep unrealized-loss phases are extremely rare and tend to compress selling pressure quickly, as weak hands eventually run out of coins to sell. This pattern is clearly visible in real market flows. A striking 65,200 BTC were recently sent to exchanges at a loss, showing that fear is not an abstract sentiment but is materializing in real, loss-driven capitulation. This kind of behavior aligns with classical capitulation structures: unrealized losses surge, panic selling intensifies, and eventually selling pressure becomes unsustainable. Once that happens, stronger hands begin absorbing supply quietly in the background. While this setup doesn’t guarantee an immediate rebound, the broader structure is shifting toward conditions that have historically preceded cyclical recoveries. STH losses remain at extreme levels, STH-SOPR is still below 1.0, and the pressure fueling exchange inflows is rooted in panic rather than fundamentals. Volatility is likely to persist, but the ongoing cleansing of weak hands is a process often seen near the end of major corrections — not at the start. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Dumps 2,800 BTC as Bitcoin Crashes Below $90K Testing Weekly Support as Momentum Weakens Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows the market approaching a critical turning point as price trades just above $91,000 following a sharp multi-week decline. The recent breakdown from the $110,000–$105,000 range has confirmed a loss of bullish momentum, with sellers gaining control and pushing BTC toward its next major weekly support cluster near the 50-week moving average around $88,000–$90,000. This zone has historically acted as a key pivot level, often signaling whether a corrective phase deepens or stabilizes. Volume adds important context. The past several weekly candles show rising sell-side activity, reflecting panic-driven exits rather than orderly distribution. However, this surge in volume also indicates that the market may be approaching a capitulation threshold, where forced selling begins to exhaust itself — a setup often seen before stronger hands step in.

But the loss of mid-term support levels and the sustained downward pressure highlight a market struggling to find confidence. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Monero (XMR) is back under heavy pressure as the market-wide correction deepens, with the privacy-focused cryptocurrency dropping 8% in the past 24 hours to trade at $375. Related Reading: Famous Trader Bets $27 Million That The XRP Price Will Crash This decline marks the fourth consecutive day of losses, erasing last week’s recovery and signaling a shift in sentiment as traders increasingly position for a deeper pullback. XMR's price records strong losses on the daily chart. Source: XMRUSD on Tradingview Monero (XMR)’s Selling Pressure Builds Further Fresh derivatives data reflect rising bearish conviction. According to CoinGlass, Monero’s futures Open Interest has fallen over the last 24 hours, while short positions now account for more than 55% of all trades. The drop in OI, now hovering around $78 million, suggests traders are withdrawing capital as fear of further downside builds. Technical indicators support this shift. The RSI has slipped below the midline, showing weakening momentum, while the MACD indicator has flashed a fresh sell signal. Together, these point toward deteriorating buying interest and a growing risk that XMR may not hold its current support levels. Support Threatened as Analysts Eye Breakdown Toward $350 Despite XMR maintaining an overall bullish structure on higher timeframes in recent months, the short-term outlook has flipped decisively bearish. The price is now testing key support zones, with the 50-day EMA at $348 emerging as the next major level to watch. A close below $358, which aligns with the neckline of a double-top pattern, would confirm a bearish breakdown, potentially accelerating losses toward the low-$300 region. Analysts warn that this scenario becomes more likely if market demand continues to weaken, particularly as retail traders rotate into alternative opportunities and risk sentiment remains fragile. Still, not all indicators point south. Analysts note that as long as XMR holds above $373, there remains potential for an intraday rebound toward the $400–$410 resistance range. But with the price already slipping below that threshold, bulls may face an uphill battle to reassert control. Privacy Narrative Remains Strong, but Momentum Falters Despite the near-term weakness, Monero continues to benefit from growing interest in privacy-preserving technologies. Recent upgrades, such as the Fluorine Fermi hard fork, have strengthened network security and improved resistance against surveillance-based threats. Long-term forecasts remain cautiously optimistic, with projections suggesting steady, though moderate, growth through 2030 and beyond. Related Reading: Analyst Says You’re Looking At XRP The Wrong Way, Here’s What It Actually Does For now, however, XMR remains vulnerable. Unless buyers step in to defend the $350–$360 support zone, analysts warn that the correction could deepen further before any meaningful recovery takes shape.

    "title": "Dogecoin Flashes Major Rebound Signal As Exchange Flows Flip, Analyst Warns",
    "body": "Dogecoin’s exchange dynamics have flipped at a key moment, with fresh on-chain data pointing to a shift in short-term market structure. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) highlighted a Glassnode chart showing that Dogecoin’s net supply on centralized exchanges has just turned positive, noting on X: “Dogecoin supply on exchanges just turned positive! This shift has marked sharp rebounds before.” Dogecoin Rebound Loading? The chart in his post, “DOGE: Exchange Net Position Change – All Exchanges,” tracks monthly exchange inflows and outflows as a histogram, alongside DOGE’s price in US dollars. Green bars indicate net inflows (more DOGE moving to exchanges than leaving), while red bars show net outflows. From mid-2024 through late 2024, the series alternates between modest red and green periods before a sustained cluster of strong green bars emerges around the fourth quarter of 2024. During that phase, net inflows rise to several billion DOGE per month. At the same time, the price line accelerated from below $0.10 to a local peak to $0.48, illustrating how heavy exchange-side activity accompanied the rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakdown Or Bottom? On-Chain Risk Hits Extreme Value Zone After that peak, the structure changes. Through early and mid-2025, the histogram becomes more mixed, with smaller positive and negative reads as price oscillates broadly between roughly $0.12 and $0.30. Heading into late 2025, however, the chart shows a pronounced sequence of red bars, with net outflows extending down toward roughly −5 to −6 billion DOGE while the price trends lower from the mid-$0.20s toward the low-$0.20s and below. The final data point, emphasized by a circular highlight on the right edge of the chart, marks a clear break in that pattern: a tall green bar crosses back above the zero line, indicating that net flows have turned positive again. At that moment, the price line sits slightly above the $0.15 mark on the vertical scale. Martinez interprets this as a “major rebound signal,” pointing to previous instances where a similar transition from persistent outflows to strong inflows coincided with sharp directional moves. DOGE On Thin Ice Below $0.16 A second chart he shared, an ATH-partitioned UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), sets out where the current DOGE supply last moved on-chain. A single, dominant bar appears around $0.07392452 and accounts for 28,260,298,271.803 DOGE, or 18.62% of the measured supply. Martinez summarizes this by stating that 27.4 billion DOGE have accumulated at roughly $0.08, calling it the “most significant support level.” Between that $0.07–$0.08 block and approximately $0.16, the URPD shows a shaded “GAP” with only small intermediate bars around levels such as $0.096, $0.125 and $0.155. Above the gap, a smaller but still notable cluster appears at about $0.162633395, containing 4,399,496,300.739 DOGE (2.9% of supply). “Below $0.16, support for Dogecoin $DOGE disappears quickly,” Martinez warns, adding that the “next real demand zone sits at $0.07.” Related Reading: One Slip And Dogecoin Could Plunge Back Into A Bear Market: Analyst A third chart, a cost-basis distribution heatmap, tracks DOGE’s price against horizontal bands representing where holders’ cost bases are concentrated. It confirms two core cohorts: a lower band between $0.0812497 and $0.08279775 with 27,397,971,652.123432 DOGE, and an upper band from $0.20103297 to $0.20486326 containing 12,156,333,652.493444 DOGE. Together with the newly positive exchange flows, these data points define a market caught between a dense realized floor around $0.08 and a substantial holder cluster near $0.20, with the latest flow reversal now in focus for traders tracking DOGE’s next move. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.158. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

As the global financial system moves toward higher costs, weaker currencies, and increasing inefficiencies, BTC is emerging as the most compelling alternative because it works more effectively. Economic Pressure Points That Will Accelerate Bitcoin Uptake In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital finance, the narrative surrounding Bitcoin’s future has often been intertwined with fervent ideological conviction. A media company, known as TFTC on X, has highlighted why BTC adoption won’t be driven by ideology, but rather by economics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Now Accepted By 4 Million Businesses, Thanks To Jack Dorsey Every merchant today is focused on handing over 2–3% of every transaction to payment processors and lives under the constant threat of chargebacks. Especially for small businesses, those costs and risks compound fast. However, BTC eliminates all of it with no processing fees, no chargebacks, just instant, final settlement straight into the merchant’s wallet. As Miles, a crypto enthusiast, consistently pointed out, the economic incentives are so overwhelmingly strong that adoption becomes inevitable. Merchants save thousands on fees, and they can pass those savings back to their customers through instant cashback rewards for using BTC. This dynamic creates a self-reinforcing flywheel effect, allowing Merchants to lower their operational costs and increase their profit margins. At the same time, consumers would get tangible rewards and better value for their money by simply using BTC. Both sides will benefit immensely, while the BTC network will grow stronger. When the underlying math is this incredibly favorable, adoption is no longer a philosophical stance, but it’s an economic certainty. The Path To Reclaiming Bullish Momentum While the economic incentives will be responsible for Bitcoin’s next rally, analyst Rekt Capital has revealed a historical demand area, marked in orange, which has played a pivotal role in dictating BTC’s next major trend. The first time price tapped this zone, it produced a sharp +20% rebound before breaking down. After this breakdown, the BTC price moved to lower levels to absorb the remaining buy-side liquidity. Related Reading: Bitcoin In Bullish Confluence: Death Cross And Key Support Signal Upside Once BTC reclaimed the orange region as support, it triggered a +37% rally to new all-time highs. On the second retest, this same support zone showed signs of strength. Currently, BTC is finding support at this same historical demand area. What would happen next will be critical in determining whether this demand area will continue to strengthen or if signs of weakening will finally emerge. Furthermore, BTC will need to break the multi-week downtrend, marked in black on the chart, to relieve fear of fading support. A rebound from this demand area that fails to break the multi-week downtrend would only result in a yield of +10% move, which suggests that the support zone may be weakening.

Another Drop In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $150 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $138 zone. The first major support is near the $135 level. A break below the $135 level might send the price toward the $128 support zone. If there is a close below the $128 support, the price could decline toward the $120 zone in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $138 and $135. Major Resistance Levels – $150 and $155.",

    "body": "The native token of the crypto exchange WhiteBIT (WBT) is leading the mid-week altcoin market after a significant 20% surge over the past 24 hours. This performance follows the announcement of a key partnership with Durrah AlFodah Holding to promote the growth of blockchain technology in Saudi Arabia. Related Reading: Solana Reclaims $140 As Second Wave Of SOL ETFs Debut – Is A Rebound Coming? WhiteBIT Secures Strategic Collab In Saudi Arabia On Tuesday, top crypto exchange WhiteBIT unveiled it had signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Durrah AlFodah Holding, represented by His Royal Highness Prince Naif Bin Abdullah Bin Saud Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, aiming to drive the Kingdom’s development in blockchain technology, digital finance, and data infrastructure. According to the announcement, the partnership aligns with the strategic pillars of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Vision 2030 program, which seeks to foster economic diversification, technological innovation, and digital transformation across the Kingdom’s public and private sectors. Therefore, it will set the foundation for key projects within the Kingdom, including stock market tokenization, Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) guidance, and the creation of national data computing and mining centers. Under the agreement, WhiteBIT will provide technological expertise and infrastructure design, while Durrah AlFodah will facilitate the crypto exchange’s market entry, regulatory engagement, and partnership development across Saudi Arabia. The move follows the exchange’s expansion to multiple jurisdictions, including Australia, Croatia, Italy, and Kazakhstan, as well as its recent dual entry into the Argentine and Brazilian markets, after key regulatory advancements in the two largest countries in South America. The collaboration reportedly envisions the creation of a joint venture company between WhiteBIT and Durrah AlFodah to manage and scale its national-scale initiatives. Volodymyr Nosov, Founder and President of W Group, the global fintech ecosystem that includes WhiteBIT, affirmed: It is an honor to work alongside the Holding of His Royal Highness Prince Naif Bin Abdullah Bin Saud to build the foundations of Saudi Arabia’s digital transformation. Together, we aim to establish secure and sovereign blockchain systems that will shape the Kingdom’s technological future. WBT Leads Mid-Week Altcoin Market Following the news, WhiteBIT’s WBT token jumped from the $51 level to a new all-time high (ATH) of $62.96 before stabilizing between the $60-$61 area. This performance builds on the remarkable WBT’s price action during the recent market volatility, which has seen many leading cryptocurrencies reach multi-month lows. Notably, the altcoin rallied to new highs in late June and consolidated within its $40-$47 range during the broader market rally between July and October. However, as the market entered a corrective phase in early November, WBT went against the current and broke out of its local range, hitting a new ATH at the time. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Worst-Case Scenario For Bitcoin (BTC) As Price Shows Concerning Signs Since then, the altcoin traded between the $50-$55 area, retesting the local range lows on Tuesday morning before the latest breakout to its new ATH. According to CoinGecko data, this performance crowns WBT as one of the leading cryptocurrencies in the past 24 hours, alongside Zcash (ZEC) and Starknet (STRK). Moreover, the altcoin, which ranks 13th among all cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, is currently the only token with double-digit gains among the top 20 cryptocurrencies. As of this writing, WBT is trading at $60.62, a 9.8% increase for the altcoin in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Bleeds Over $500 Million In Its Biggest One-Day Outflow",
    "body": "Nearly two years after the inception of the Bitcoin ETF sector in the United States, these funds are currently grappling with significant challenges, exacerbated by mounting concerns regarding a potential bear market in the coming months. This turmoil is exemplified by the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which experienced its largest single-day withdrawal since launch, further contributing to the decline in Bitcoin’s price. Profit-Taking And Caution The recent outflows from BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF highlight the severity of the current selloff within the Bitcoin market, which has experienced a substantial correction below the crucial $100,000 mark following a record high reached in October. Related Reading: Kraken Achieves $20 Billion Valuation With $200 Million Investment From Citadel This downturn emphasizes the widespread pullback affecting various risk assets, while gold has notably remained resilient. Some analysts suggest that these developments indicate a trend of investors shifting their exposure from Bitcoin to gold. “The crypto market entered a hangover in August,” said Thomas Perfumo, Global Economist at Kraken, in a recent interview with Reuters, noting that much of the earlier demand for Bitcoin had been fueled by borrowed funds. He added, “Momentum seemingly peaked during the summer. But the truth is this hangover trend started months ago.” Analysts have also pointed to profit-taking behaviors among long-term holders and increasing caution among Bitcoin ETF funds and digital asset treasury (DAT) firms, which had previously ramped up their acquisitions throughout the year. Brian Vieten, a research analyst at Siebert Financial, stated that Bitcoin treasury companies had collectively purchased nearly $50 billion worth of Bitcoin over the past year. Recently, however, many of these firms have begun trading at a discount to their net asset value, which could dampen market expectations for new Bitcoin purchases in the near term. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Plummet This shift occurs amid rising concerns among heavyweight investors regarding inflated valuations across various asset classes. José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, noted that “an ongoing lack of speculative spirits is weighing on Bitcoin.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Dips Below $90,000—Yet Altcoins Remain Unscathed: Here’s Why Despite managing over $73 billion in assets, IBIT has seen a decline of 19% in the current quarter. Data from SoSoValue indicates that spot Bitcoin ETF funds collectively have recorded $2.59 billion in outflows this month alone. Leading the pack is BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, which has experienced $1.78 billion in outflows in November alone. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) ranks second, with nearly $540 million in outflows. The turbulence isn’t limited to Bitcoin; the Ethereum exchange-traded fund sector also faced outflows, totaling approximately $74.2 million yesterday, with BlackRock selling off $165.1 million. On a more positive note, Solana spot ETFs reported net inflows of $30.09 million on Tuesday, primarily driven by Bitwise’s BSOL. This marks a major streak of 15 consecutive days of inflows for Solana. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Why Bitcoin Hyper’s $28M Presale Has Next 1000x Crypto Potential",
    "body": "What to Know: Bitcoin Hyper aims to turn Bitcoin into a fast, smart-contract-ready Layer 2 using SVM, canonical bridging, and ZK-secured rollups. The $HYPER presale has raised over $28.16M at roughly $0.013305 per token, with strong whale entries and active retail demand. Stakers can lock $HYPER for around 41% APY, with over a billion tokens already committed, aligning early holders with long-term network growth. Price models suggest multi-X potential if the roadmap lands, but competition, delivery risk, and market shocks make $HYPER a high-risk, high-reward bet. Bitcoin is at $92K now, but it doesn’t exactly feel like victory lap season. Price action is choppy, majors are flashing double-digit red, and on-chain data keeps reminding everyone that the original crypto is still slow, expensive, and allergic to smart contracts. Bitcoin processes around seven transactions per second, fees spike whenever activity returns, and most of DeFi, NFTs, and on-chain experimentation still lives on faster networks like Solana. That leaves a strange gap: the most valuable asset in crypto is mostly sidelined from the high-growth side of Web3. That gap is exactly what new Bitcoin Layer-2 projects are trying to close. Among them, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has quietly pushed its presale past $28M at ~$0.013305/token, just as the market shifts back from panic to cautious dip-buying. Multiple market roundups now place it in the micro-cap, infrastructure-narrative bucket that speculators scan when they hunt the next 1000x crypto. Bitcoin Hyper’s pitch is simple but aggressive: turn Bitcoin into a high-throughput, smart-contract-ready Layer 2 while keeping Bitcoin-grade security. Under the hood, that means a Solana-style virtual machine, a canonical bridge for wrapped $BTC, and a rollup design secured with zero-knowledge proofs. Early investors have already staked over a billion $HYPER for yields around 41% APY, and whale buys in the hundreds of thousands of dollars ($500K just 6 days ago) suggest larger players are at least testing the waters. With the presale now past the $28M mark, the obvious question is whether Bitcoin Hyper is just another cycle narrative… or a serious contender for the next breakout Layer-2 play. Bitcoin Hyper Turns Bitcoin Into A DeFi-Capable Layer 2 At its core, Bitcoin Hyper is a rollup-style Layer-2 built specifically for Bitcoin. Users send $BTC to a monitored address on the main chain; an SVM-based smart contract verifies the deposit and mints an equivalent amount of $BTC on the Hyper network. Once bridged, that wrapped $BTC moves on a high-throughput chain with near-instant finality and sub-cent fees. Instead of forcing Bitcoin itself to run complex logic, Bitcoin Hyper batches transactions off-chain and periodically commits state back to Layer 1 using zero-knowledge proofs. That keeps the heavy security properties where they belong while shifting day-to-day activity to a faster execution layer. In practice, it lets Bitcoin behave like a settlement engine while Bitcoin Hyper handles payments, trading, and app activity. The Solana Virtual Machine is a key part of that design. By leaning on SVM tooling, Bitcoin Hyper lets developers deploy DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, games, and order-book DEXs with a familiar stack. Rust devs who already know Solana don’t need to relearn everything just to build on a Bitcoin-settled rollup. That cuts friction and gives the project a realistic path to a working ecosystem instead of a ghost chain. For anyone who wants exposure tied to Bitcoin and access to DeFi yields, NFT rails, and meme coin experiments, a $BTC-anchored Layer-2 like this is a clean narrative. If that thesis plays out and Bitcoin Hyper actually ships at scale, $HYPER stops being just a meme-wrapped token and starts looking like the core asset of a new Bitcoin DeFi stack. 📚 Read more about what Bitcoin Hyper is planning in our guide. Bitcoin Hyper Breaks $28M, Whales Continue Buying Stacks On the numbers side, $HYPER has already raised over $28M, placing $HYPER firmly in the early micro-cap bracket. The current stage price is $0.013305, up roughly 15% from the initial $0.0115, with fresh funding still flowing in despite broader market volatility. Presale buyers can also stake their tokens for 41% APY now, but this will drop as more people stake tokens. On the upside math, our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction outlines a 2026 high around $0.08625, assuming the roadmap is delivered and liquidity lands on major exchanges. From today’s presale price of $0.013305, that implies roughly a 6.5x to the 2026 high if everything clicks. Longer term, $HYPER could push a 2030 high near $0.253, which would be a 20x-plus move versus early presale levels. 🤑 Here’s how to buy $HYPER before it hits $30M. This is exactly type of asymmetric setup presale hunters look for. A Bitcoin-settled rollup with audited contracts, a live staking program, and more than $28M already committed has a very different risk profile from pure meme plays with no tech. Some analysts are already tagging $HYPER as a potential high-beta proxy on Bitcoin’s evolution, and in a market obsessed with the next 1000x crypto narrative, that combination of real infrastructure and early-stage pricing is why it keeps popping up on watchlists. Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale for just $0.013305/token! Disclaimer: This article is informational only, not financial advice.

    "title": "CEO Cuts Cardano Founder’s Bitcoin Price Forecast, Warns Bear Market Just Starting",
    "body": "Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson previously projected that the Bitcoin price could reach an impressive price of $250,000 as early as this year. This bold forecast, made in April, came at a time when Bitcoin was trading at $77,000 after achieving a record high of $109,000 in January. Hoskinson’s Optimistic Bitcoin Price Forecast Hoskinson’s optimism was based on his belief that international negotiations, particularly between the US and China, would favor Bitcoin’s growth. The Cardano founder suggested that easing tariffs would lead to a positive market reaction and bolster adoption, particularly with the anticipated passage of the GENIUS Act, which was signed into law by President Trump a few months later. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dips Below $90,000—Yet Altcoins Remain Unscathed: Here’s Why However, the current market realities have raised doubts about Hoskinson’s prediction. Since then, Bitcoin has experienced significant fluctuations, briefly regaining momentum to reach $126,000 mid-October, only to see the broader crypto market subsequently shed over $1 trillion in total market cap. This downturn has largely been attributed to persistent selling pressure by concerned investors, and substantial outflows from the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) sector, with nearly $2 billion sold over since October. As it stands, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $89,300, marking a nearly 30% decline from its recently achieved all-time highs. In light of this, Jacob King, CEO of Swandesk, publicly dismissed Hoskinson’s $250,000 price target, characterizing it as unrealistic. Is Bitcoin In A New Bear Market Cycle? In a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), King stated that such lofty price predictions are “pulled out of thin air” and reflect a market still grappling with “delusions.” King elaborated on his viewpoint, suggesting that the industry is in the early stages of a new bear market cycle. He is not alone in this assessment. Market expert Lark Davis recently noted that, based on the classic four-year Bitcoin price cycle, the cryptocurrency has officially entered bear market territory. Davis commented that this scenario leaves two possibilities: either the established four-year cycle is no longer relevant, or the market has indeed shifted into a bearish phase. Given the current macroeconomic backdrop, he leans toward the latter interpretation.

An analyst known as Mr. Wall Street has recently speculated that the Bitcoin price peaked at $126,000. The analyst believes that this may mark the zenith for this cycle, predicting that the Bitcoin price could next face significant downward pressure, potentially slipping to a range between $74,000 and $82,000. He further forecasts a possible decline to levels between $54,000 and $60,000 by the fourth quarter of 2026. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin To Suffer 40% Crash From All-Time High? Analyst Reveals ‘Final Target’",
    "body": "Sentiment around Bitcoin has suffered a major hit in recent weeks after the price fell below $100,000. This has led to a series of bearish predictions for the cryptocurrency, as many analysts and investors alike believe that the crash is far from over. One analyst, who goes by Mr. Wall Street on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, has predicted a step decline, revealing how low the Bitcoin price will go and when the crash should be expected to be over. Bitcoin Headed below $60,000? In the post, Mr. Wall Street expressed that the Bitcoin price has already hit its cycle top, and as such, there is nowhere else to go but down. The chart points to possible price reversals for the cryptocurrency, but ultimately, all of these are expected to be short-lived and precede further crashes. Related Reading: Wondering Why The XRP Price Is Still Lagging Despite Record ETF Launch? Read This As the Bitcoin price struggles to reclaim $100,000, the crypto analyst warns that it is more likely to crash further, highlighting the $74,000-$82,000 level as the next major point of interest. This would mean that Bitcoin could see a more than 10% drop in price from this level. However, the analyst doesn’t stop there ,as it seems the Bitcoin price is headed into another stretch of bear market. The year is already rapidly coming to an end, and the crypto analyst expects the year 2026 to be even more bearish. By next year, Mr. Wall Street believes that the Bitcoin price could fall below $60,000, reaching as low as $54,000. The timeframe for this is set in the last quarter of 2026, but this would also mark the bottom. Given this, the analyst believes that the $54,000-$60,000 will be the best time to get into the asset to position for the next wave of upward movements. Head And Shoulders Pattern Supports Decline The bearish sentiment is echoed by others such as Leshka.eth, whose recent analysis also points to a possible drop in price. The analyst shows that Bitcoin completed a head and shoulders pattern, with the neckline firmly in place. Given this, the price has entered into a state of reset, and this reset is far from over. Related Reading: Forget XRP, DFDV Exec Predicts Solana Price Is Headed For $10,000 Interestingly, Leshka.eth also posits that the Bitcoin price will crash by over 40% from its all-time high prices. This was highlighted in an earlier post that predicts that BTC is headed for as low as $40,000. The timeline also suggests that this will happen sometime in 2026, before a bottom is established.

    "title": "Best Crypto Presales To Watch As Bitwise’s XRP ETF ‘Historic Moment’ Lands Today",
    "body": "What to Know: Bitwise’s XRP ETF has launched on NYSE Arca with a 0.34% fee waived on the first $500M, positioning XRP as an institution-ready asset. XRP dropped more than 9% into the launch before recovering, with higher volumes and futures open interest indicating renewed speculative and hedging activity. Best Wallet Token, Bitcoin Hyper, and Ionix Chain map onto themes supported by ETF flows: self-custody, Bitcoin scalability, and AI-native infrastructure. These projects provide presale access and strong utility narratives but still come with early-stage risks tied to execution, exchange listings, and long-term adoption. Bitwise’s spot XRP ETF is finally live on NYSE Arca under the ticker ‘XRP’, and the issuer is calling it a ‘historic moment’. The $15B asset manager has set a 0.34% management fee and is waiving it for the first month on the first $500M of assets, an aggressive move to capture early institutional flow. The market reaction has already been spicy. XRP dumped more than 9% to around $2 on classic ‘sell the news’ flows, then bounced back to about $2.12 as volumes jumped and futures open interest ticked higher. That’s the ETF era in a nutshell: institutions get a cleaner wrapper, traders get more volatility to play with. This matters beyond XRP. Spot ETFs helped normalize exposure to $BTC and $ETH; now one of the biggest payments tokens is getting the same treatment. As capital moves from blue chips into higher-beta plays, altcoins and the best crypto presales tend to ride the second wave of risk-on sentiment. Three presales line up neatly with this shift: a wallet super-app built for self-custody, a Bitcoin Layer-2 turning ‘digital gold’ into active collateral, and an AI-native Layer-1 chasing the next infrastructure trade. Here’s how Best Wallet Token, Bitcoin Hyper, and Ionix Chain fit into the post-ETF landscape. 1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST): Wallet Super-App For The Post-ETF Onboarding Wave If XRP ETFs succeed, a fresh wave of non-crypto natives will end up holding digital assets for the first time. Those users eventually graduate from brokerage accounts into self-custody, and that’s exactly where Best Wallet Token tries to position itself. Best Wallet is a live, non-custodial, multi-chain wallet with fiat on/off-ramps, portfolio tracking, and cross-chain swaps routed through hundreds of DEXs and bridges. It already counts hundreds of thousands of users, supports major chains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain, and is rolling out a debit card, analytics suite, advanced order types, and a staking aggregator. The idea is simple: one app that feels like a trading terminal, not a barebones wallet. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the access key to that stack. Holders get reduced swap and on-ramp fees, boosted staking yields, governance rights, and early ‘Stage 0’ access to new token launches inside the wallet’s launchpad. The presale has raised over $17.23M so far, with the current stage pricing $BEST at about $0.025975 and staking yields around 76% APY for early participants. To buy $BEST and start staking, check out our guide. Our $BEST price prediction suggests that, if the roadmap lands and exchange listings arrive in a supportive market, $BEST could potentially reach up to roughly $0.05106175 in 2026. From today’s presale level, that implies a 96% upside scenario. If ETF flows pull more people into crypto, full-stack self-custody tools should be one of the structural winners. Check out Best Wallet Token. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): BTC Layer-2 Turning ‘Digital Gold’ Into DeFi Collateral While XRP steals today’s headlines, Bitcoin is still the main liquidity engine in this market. The problem: as a base layer, it’s slow, expensive, and terrible for DeFi. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is trying to fix that without touching Bitcoin’s core security model. Bitcoin Hyper builds a high-throughput Layer-2 using the Solana Virtual Machine . Users bridge $BTC into the network via a canonical bridge; wrapped $BTC then moves on a fast chain with near-instant finality and sub-cent fees, while settlement still anchors back to Bitcoin. That opens the door for $BTC-denominated DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and even meme coins, all while remaining ‘Bitcoin-native’. The HYPER presale has already crossed roughly $28M raised at a token price of $0.013305, with staking rewards at 41% APY. There’s no private VC round in front, and on-chain data shows multiple six-figure whale tickets (including a $500K buy and a $379K purchase ), which is why this sale keeps popping up on presale trackers. Learn how to buy $HYPER to get in early. From a valuation angle, our $HYPER price prediction put a potential 2026 high around $0.08625. Measured from the current sale level, that’s roughly 546% upside in the optimistic case. The thesis is clean: if ETFs push more capital into $BTC, a working $BTC Layer-2 that actually lets that capital do something could be in the slipstream. Research Bitcoin Hyper today. 3. Ionix Chain ($IONX) — Quantum AI Layer-1 With Built-In Revenue Sharing Where XRP ETFs reflect TradFi edging into crypto, Ionix Chain ($IONX) represents the opposite direction: crypto infrastructure leaning into AI. Ionix pitches itself as the first AI-native Layer-1 blockchain using a proprietary Quantum AI Consensus to hit up to 500,000 TPS with sub-second finality and gas fees near $0.0005. Under the hood it combines Proof-of-Stake with a DAG-style architecture, plus sharding, to stay scalable as usage grows. The network is designed for AI-heavy workloads: adaptive smart contracts that optimize in real time, on-chain ML computation, and cross-chain bridges into ecosystems like Ethereum and Solana. In other words, it’s built for the part of the market where AI and DeFi start blending, exactly the type of narrative that tends to catch fire when risk appetite returns after big events like the XRP ETF launch. Tokenomics are tailored to keep holders plugged in. $IONX stakers can currently earn around 12% APY in the presale, while the protocol plans to distribute 15% of daily gas fees back to token holders and add up to 5% loyalty airdrops for early participants. The presale has already raised more than $1.57M, with the current stage pricing IONX at about $0.050. If the mainnet lands by 2026, major CEX/DEX listings go ahead around the planned $2 listing band, and the AI-chain narrative actually converts to real usage, Ionix could launch hard and climb fast. The XRP ETF launch marks another step in crypto’s institutionalization, with Bitwise offering fee-waived exposure to XRP just as traders lean back into risk. That backdrop sets the scene for selectively hunting upside further out the curve. Best Wallet Token targets the self-custody and tools layer, Bitcoin Hyper extends Bitcoin into high-speed DeFi, and Ionix Chain bets on AI-driven infrastructure, three very different ways to play the same shift in capital and narrative.

    "title": "Nvidia’s $54B Earnings Test and Fed Minutes Put Best Wallet Token in Play",
    "body": "What to Know: Nvidia’s $54.8B earnings report, Fed Minutes, and a muted 50K jobs print could collectively reset risk sentiment in favor of crypto. Bitcoin’s drop toward seven-month lows looks sentiment-driven, and a dovish macro trifecta may trigger a sharp relief rally in majors. Best Wallet Token powers a multi-chain, security-first wallet that bundles fee discounts, staking, launchpad access, and future card rewards into one token. If roadmap execution and market conditions align, $BEST offers a leveraged play on multi-chain adoption rather than a single-narrative altcoin bet. Markets are walking a tightrope this week. Nvidia is set to report $54B+ in Q3 revenue , a figure big enough to make or break the AI trade that has driven much of 2025’s risk rally. Futures across stocks and crypto have been drifting as traders wait to see whether the world’s top AI chipmaker can justify its massive valuation and keep the AI narrative alive. At the same time, the Federal Reserve’s October Meeting Minutes and the delayed September US jobs report are about to drop. Economists expect roughly 50K new jobs, a clear comedown from earlier in the year. A softer payrolls print combined with divided Fed views on further cuts would reinforce the idea that policy is slowly tilting back toward easier conditions, even if inflation is still above target. Bitcoin has already been slapped down to near seven-month lows, roughly 25–30% below its recent peak, in a pullback analysts describe as sentiment-driven rather than structural. If Nvidia smashes expectations and the macro data lean dovish, that combination could flip the switch back to ‘risk-on’ and give both Bitcoin and altcoins room for a sharp relief rally. When that kind of macro reset hits, fresh liquidity doesn’t just chase the majors. It needs rails, wallets, and launchpads that make it easy for new users to move from fiat into crypto, hop across chains, and discover the next wave of tokens. That’s where infrastructure plays come in, and it’s exactly the lane Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is trying to own with a multi-chain wallet, in-app presale access, and a presale that has already raised more than $17.2M at $0.025975 per token with around 76% staking rewards. Best Wallet Token Aims to Be the Default On-Ramp The current non-custodial wallet landscape is messy. Newcomers juggle multiple apps, seed phrases, and gas settings across chains, while veterans still pay too much in swap fees and miss early-stage deals because everything is fragmented. Best Wallet is designed to stitch that chaos together, and Best Wallet Token is there to help. The app is a true multi-chain wallet, with support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Polygon, Base and more, letting users buy, store, deposit, send, and swap thousands of tokens from one interface. Fiat on-ramps are integrated through partners like Onramper to surface aggressive rates and lower card processing costs, which matters when altcoin rotations kick off and every percentage point of friction eats into upside. Security is handled with MPC tech from Fireblocks and cloud backups instead of exposed seed phrases, plus features like 2FA, biometric login, and advanced anti-fraud tooling. That’s aimed squarely at the next wave of users who want self-custody without feeling like they’re one mistyped word away from losing a portfolio. On top sits the $BEST token . Holding $BEST reduces transaction fees when buying or swapping crypto in-app, cuts swap costs across the 330-DEX, 30-bridge routing stack, and boosts rewards on the upcoming Best Card, which plans up to 8% cashback for heavy users. Learn more about $BEST in our Best Wallet Token guide . Best Wallet’s launchpad feature also gives $BEST holders early access to the best crypto presales at a ‘Phase 0’ price before wider listings, letting them rotate into new narratives faster and cheaper than users stuck on legacy wallets. This lines up neatly with where the market is heading. Tokenized funds, regulated stablecoins, and payments giants experimenting with on-chain rails all point toward a future where compliant wallets with deep DeFi hooks become the main interface for value transfer. Best Wallet is built to sit in that intersection, connecting regulated stablecoin flows with native DeFi and presale access. As capital trickles back into risk assets, a wallet-plus-token combo that makes multi-chain navigation easy could attract both first-timers and battle-hardened degen traders. Watch $BEST as onboarding demand grows. Inside the $BEST Presale, Staking, and Potential Upside The presale is currently priced at $0.025975 per token, with more than $17.2M already raised and a sizeable social footprint across X, Telegram, and Discord. Staking is live during the presale, offering 76% APY powered by an 800M-token (8%) allocation dedicated to staking rewards. That lets early buyers immediately put idle tokens to work while the sale is still ongoing, compounding exposure if the token lists into an improving macro backdrop. Learn how to join and stake in our guide to buying $BEST tokens . Our $BEST price prediction suggest that $BEST could trade around $0.035215 in 2025 and $0.05106 in 2026. From today’s presale price, those levels would roughly equate to 36% and 97% upside respectively, before factoring in any staking yield. None of that is guaranteed, but it sketches out the kind of risk-reward profile some presale buyers are targeting. If Nvidia’s earnings confirm that the AI boom still has legs and the Fed’s tone softens on the back of a weak 50K jobs print, that cocktail could refill the risk-asset punch bowl. In those conditions, a presale-stage wallet token plugged directly into multi-chain liquidity, presales, and stablecoin rails becomes a clear way to get leveraged exposure to the next adoption wave without betting on a single niche sector like meme coins or gaming. Join $BEST before the presale closes. This article is informational only, not investment advice; crypto prices and presale outcomes are highly speculative and capital is at risk.

    "title": "Why Maxi Doge Could Run After SPX6900 Rebound – Best Meme Coins Reset",
    "body": "What to Know: SPX6900 has rebounded from support near $0.44 to the $0.56 zone on strengthening volume and positive funding rates. Technical signals point to easing bearish pressure and a potential move toward higher resistance, keeping meme coin risk firmly in play. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) aligns with this revived meme momentum through Ethereum-based tokenomics, staking, contests, and lifestyle branding centered on leverage culture. The $MAXI presale offers high staking APY and low entry pricing, though long-term performance still relies on delivery and community expansion. SPX6900 has quietly flipped the script this week. After tagging key support near $0.44 on Monday, the ‘meme S&P 500’ bounced more than 25%, now trading at around $0.56 with solid green candles on the daily chart. On-chain and derivatives data back up the move. Spot and futures volume climbed above $65M, whale orders are skewed to the buy side, and funding rates have turned positive, showing more traders paying to stay long than to stay short. 📈 The daily RSI has pushed up from oversold while MACD has flipped bullish, hinting that the worst of the pullback may be behind SPX for now. When a flagship meme index like SPX6900 stops bleeding and starts grinding higher again, it usually does two things. It restores risk appetite across the meme coin complex and it reminds everyone that ‘joke’ tokens can move like small caps on caffeine when liquidity comes back. For traders scanning for the best meme coins, that combination matters more than the short-term price target. This is exactly the backdrop where the best meme coins tend to catch a bid. If capital rotates back into meme coin plays, traders often look beyond the already-run majors to cheaper, more narrative-driven tokens that can ride the same wave with more upside. That is where Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is positioning itself: a gym-rat Doge for the leverage era, with staking yield and lifestyle branding designed for traders who live on perpetuals charts rather than blue-chip fundamentals. SPX6900 Momentum Sets the Stage for Maxi Doge SPX6900’s whole pitch is financial satire: a parody of the S&P 500 where ‘6900 > 500’ and the market becomes a meme in itself. It runs on Ethereum with multi-chain extensions and has built a cult community by mocking the seriousness of traditional benchmarks while still delivering real liquidity. The current rebound is driven by real flows, not just vibes. Trading volume has hit its highest level since early November as funding flips positive. Historically, that kind of shift in SPX6900 has preceded sharp upside moves as sidelined traders FOMO back in. 💡 When that happens, attention usually spills over into the broader meme coin basket. Dog coins, high-volatility newcomers and presales with strong narratives tend to see more traffic as traders look for ‘the next $SPX’ at a fraction of the price. Maxi Doge leans directly into that environment. It brands itself as the mascot of max-risk trading culture: a 240-lb Shiba Inu lifting weights between 1000x leverage sessions, built specifically for the degen mood that SPX6900 embodies. If SPX6900 can extend its recovery, meme coin risk could stay elevated into year-end. In that scenario, projects that offer pure meme coin energy plus simple, understandable tokenomics are likely to benefit first. That is the niche Maxi Doge is trying to occupy: not competing with $SPX itself but acting as a smaller-cap satellite play on the same sentiment. Maxi Doge Presale, Staking and Meme Utility Explained Under the memes, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a straightforward ERC-20 token on Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake network, with transactions secured by audited smart contracts. Total supply is capped at roughly 150B tokens, split across marketing, development, liquidity, staking and the project’s ‘Maxi Fund’ treasury. That treasury, plus a 40% marketing bucket, are designed to keep the meme visible with KOL deals, ads and potential exchange campaigns once trading goes live. Where Maxi Doge tries to go beyond pure hype is yield. Current staking rewards sit at 74% APY, paid in $MAXI, with distributions handled by a daily smart-contract pool. 💡 For anyone used to holding $DOGE or $SHIB for vibes alone, the idea of locking tokens and earning protocol yield is a clear upgrade, even if the rate naturally trends lower as more tokens are staked. On the adoption side, the presale has already raised more than $4.1M, with the current token price at $0.000269. Multiple stages nudge the price up over time, which is why early entries focus on locking in the lower bands before the next increment hits. To join now, learn how to buy $MAXI with our step-by-step guide. In the meantime, tens of billions of tokens are already staked, suggesting that a decent chunk of the early base is not planning to insta-dump at TGE. Of course, Maxi Doge still lives and dies by community and execution. The team remains anonymous, the roadmap is deliberately tongue-in-cheek, and real value will depend on whether staking, contests and partner events actually gain traction once the presale ends. Still, in a market where SPX6900 is reminding everyone that memes can move billions, a $4.1M meme coin presale with yield and audits attached will naturally catch attention. 🚀 Join the Maxi Doge presale today.

ETFs Could Consume It All, Analyst Predicts According to Santiment, more than 102,000 transactions above $100,000 and roughly 29,000 transactions above $1 million were recorded over the recent stretch — a level that could make this the most active whale week of 2025. Whale Counts Climb As Small Holders Fall Back Based on Glassnode figures, the number of addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC rose to 1,384 from 1,354 about three weeks earlier, a 2.2% rise and the highest count in four months. At the same time, wallets with one BTC or less slipped to about 977,420 from 980,577 late in October, showing smaller holders are thinning out. Those two trends together have some market watchers reading a shift from panic selling toward larger buyers taking positions. 📊 Bitcoin’s whales have gotten more and more active as prices have dumped over the past six weeks.

Others say the pattern looks like forced selling by leveraged accounts, followed by accumulation as the market finds a new base. One on-chain observer flagged repeated, time-bound selling that could be tied to liquidation events, a pattern that might end once available supply dries up or liquidations stop. Market Sentiment Has Turned Very Negative Sentiment gauges show fear is strong. Reports put the Crypto Fear & Greed Index near 11, a reading inside the “extreme fear” zone, and on-chain short-term holder measures have weakened, with the STH Realized Profit-Loss Ratio dipping below levels often seen around local lows. Taken together, those readings suggest many recent buyers are underwater and that capitulation has been intense. If large transfers recorded by Santiment were mostly outbound from exchanges, that would look like accumulation into cold storage or OTC custody and could reduce sell pressure. If those moves were inbound to exchange wallets, the same flows could point to distribution. Right now, the data show a mixture: big holders are increasing their counts while weaker hands exit, which can support a stabilizing bottom, but it also leaves room for short-term swings if another forced seller appears. Related Reading: With 42% Of XRP Holders Underwater, Analysts Say The Altcoin Could Crash Even Further Several market participants described the move as a “washout” that clears short-term froth. Others noted that news events — from major earnings to macro headlines — have amplified twitch trading and sudden swings, which can trigger both big transfers and sudden price drops. A handful of asset managers say they are seeing buying at discounted prices while retail participation cools. Featured image from Gemini, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "What to Know: BlackRock’s move toward a staked Ethereum ETF marks the arrival of yield-bearing crypto ETFs that blend price exposure with on-chain staking rewards. The success of ETHA and broader interest in staking products indicate that major asset managers are ready to scale deeper into core crypto infrastructure. Bitcoin Hyper addresses Bitcoin’s scalability limits through a rollup-style Layer-2 using wrapped BTC, aiming to transform Bitcoin into a functional DeFi settlement layer. With more than $28M raised, 41% staking rewards, and utility tied directly to Bitcoin’s expansion, Bitcoin Hyper provides asymmetric upside in an ETF-driven market cycle. BlackRock just spun up a new trust in Delaware for an iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF, signaling phase two of institutional crypto: yield on-chain, wrapped in TradFi. Roughly 15 months after launching its flagship Ethereum ETF, $ETHA, the asset management giant is now lining up a product that combines $ETH price exposure with staking rewards. $ETHA, which launched in July 2024, has already pulled in around $13B in inflows and quickly became one of the most successful spot Ethereum ETFs on the market. The key detail: ETHA itself does not stake its $ETH, so investors get pure price exposure alone, and nothing from the roughly 4% average staking yield that validators earn on-chain. The new trust changes that equation. A staked $ETH ETF would transform Ethereum exposure into a total-return product, tacking on staking yield to capital gains. That kind of structure is tailor-made for institutions that want the benefits of blockchain without running their own validator infrastructure or worrying about slashing risks. As more issuers follow with staking products, a larger slice of $ETH will be locked up, tightening supply and deepening liquidity in regulated venues. When big money gets comfortable with yield-bearing crypto ETFs on Bitcoin and Ethereum, the usual pattern is simple: liquidity and attention trickle down the risk curve. First majors, then high-beta infrastructure plays. In this cycle, one of the cleanest ways to express that ‘higher beta on Bitcoin’ thesis is not another meme coin, but a Bitcoin Layer-2 like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) that tracks Bitcoin’s performance while adding real utility. That is where Bitcoin Hyper’s ongoing presale starts to look very interesting. Bitcoin Hyper Turns Bitcoin into A Scalable DeFi Powerhouse Bitcoin Hyper is building a Layer-2 rollup on top of Bitcoin that batches transactions off-chain, executes them at high speed, then settles the final state back to Bitcoin Layer-1. In practice, it aims to turn Bitcoin into something that feels closer to Solana in terms of speed, while still inheriting Bitcoin’s battle-tested security. To do this, the team uses a canonical bridge that wraps native $BTC into a compatible asset for use on the Hyper rollup. A Solana Virtual Machine environment then handles execution, enabling thousands of transactions per second and near-instant finality. On top of that, developers can plug in DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and other dApps that simply are not viable on Bitcoin’s base layer today. This is the pain point Bitcoin Hyper goes after: Bitcoin is the largest, most trusted asset in crypto, yet still awkward to use beyond simple transfers and custody. Fees spike in every hype cycle, throughput caps out around single-digit TPS, and DeFi flows largely bypass the network. By pushing computation to an L2 while anchoring security on Bitcoin, Hyper tries to unlock that trapped value. From a macro angle, the timing lines up with the ETF story. As spot Bitcoin ETFs accumulate coins and BlackRock explores yield products on Ethereum, more institutional capital is parked in base-layer assets. The next logical step is infrastructure that lets those assets actually move and work in DeFi. A Bitcoin-native L2 that can route wrapped BTC into lending, DEXs, and payments is directly aligned with that shift. Add in the project’s public focus on conservative security assumptions, and the narrative becomes straightforward: a scaling solution that respects the base chain, rather than trying to replace it. Bitcoin Hyper Presale, Staking Rewards, And ETF-Driven Upside On the numbers side, the Bitcoin Hyper presale has already raised over $28M, with the current token price sitting at $0.013305. That puts it in the upper tier of the best crypto presales of 2025 and suggests there is real appetite for Bitcoin-aligned infrastructure rather than just memes. Staking is a major part of the pitch. Early buyers can stake $HYPER for reported rewards of around 41%, turning idle presale allocations into a yield-bearing position while the team ships its roadmap. Learn how to buy and stake $HYPER today. For investors who are already eyeing BlackRock’s staked $ETH ETF as a source of passive income, that kind of on-chain yield on a high-beta token adds an extra layer of torque. There is also a clear roadmap-linked upside story. Our price modeling sees potential highs of $0.08625 in 2026 if Bitcoin Hyper hits its milestones around mainnet, early dApps, and DAO launch. Relative to the current presale price of $0.013305, that target implies roughly a 546% increase. For holders who already believe in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory and see BlackRock-style products as confirmation, $HYPER acts like a leveraged play on that same thesis: more throughput, more DeFi rails, and more ways for $BTC liquidity to earn yield. In other words, while BlackRock stays tightly focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, investors who want to front-run where that institutional adoption might push demand next are looking directly at Bitcoin Layer-2s. Right now, Bitcoin Hyper is one of the few presales offering that combination of narrative fit, clear technical design, and significant capital already committed. Check out the Bitcoin Hyper presale.

    "title": "Pundit’s Bitcoin 3-Month Scenario Shows Massive Crash, Here’s The Target",
    "body": "Crypto pundit Andrea has shared a 3-month scenario for Bitcoin that shows the flagship crypto could suffer a massive crash. This crash is expected to follow BTC’s rebound and an end-of-year rally to new highs. Pundit Projects Bitcoin Crash To $60,000 After Rebound To New Highs In an X post, Andrea shared an accompanying chart showing that Bitcoin could eventually crash to $60,000, with the crash expected sometime in mid-2026. However, before then, the crypto pundit predicted that BTC could still rally to new highs despite its recent crash below the psychological $100,000 level. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Keeps Crashing- Is $80,000 Next? Specifically, he revealed a potential three-month scenario for Bitcoin, stating that he expects an end-of-year rally to at least $115,000-$116,000. The crypto pundit added that if BTC can break that level, then it could push towards $135,000 and $140,000, which will mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for the flagship crypto. However, Andrea stated that the peculiarity of this pump will be with a dropping BTC dominance, with altcoins outperforming the flagship crypto. This analysis comes amid Bitcoin’s most recent crash below $90,000, which marked a seven-month low for BTC. Notably, veteran trader Peter Brandt has predicted that this decline could extend further, with the flagship crypto dropping to as low as $58,000. Brandt questioned whether Bitcoin’s sweeping reversal on November 11, followed by 8 days of lower highs and the completion of a massive broadening top, qualifies as a bear market. He added that the targets implied are $81,000 and $58,000. The veteran trader also remarked that those who claim they will be big buyers at $58,000 will be pukers by the time BTC reaches $60,000. BTC Suffers A Breakdown Of The Megaphone Pattern Crypto analyst Colin revealed that Bitcoin has broken down from the megaphone pattern. He noted that without a quick recovery in the next day or two, this would suggest that BTC is entering a bear market. He opined that this bear market may be less intense due to diminishing returns and diminishing losses each cycle. Related Reading: 4 Bitcoin Indicators That Led To Market Rallies In The Last 2 Years Have Returned The analyst reiterated that if the Bitcoin price can reclaim the 50-week moving average before the week is over, it could signal a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto. However, until then, he remarked that it is better to assume that a bear market or bigger correction is the most likely scenario. Colin also raised the possibility of BTC following the ISM (business cycle) higher in a big move next year, after this corrective period. If that happens, then the bear market may be short-lived. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $93,000, up almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "Here’s The Resistance Zone Keeping The Dogecoin Price From Rallying",
    "body": "The Dogecoin price has spent the past several days moving through a noticeably weaker phase, falling from the mid-$0.18 region into a prolonged decline that has kept the price tilted downward. The chart shows a major high forming near $0.18311 before sellers forced the price into a tight downtrend, but every attempted bounce has turned into another correction. Technical analysis from BitGuru focuses on why this rebound attempt is still weak and what Dogecoin must break above before any meaningful rally can begin. Dogecoin Price Downtrend And Repeated Corrections The structure of Dogecoin’s price action since reaching $0.183 on November 10 makes the weakness clear. After topping at $0.18311, Dogecoin slipped into a descending channel, with the downtrend highlighted by lower highs across November 11 and 12. Each time the price tried to push upward, the move stalled at a predictable level, creating another corrective swing. The chart shows this clearly during the November 13 and 14 period, where a modest recovery reached $0.16598 before sellers regained control. Related Reading: Analyst Says You’re Looking At XRP The Wrong Way, Here’s What It Actually Does Since then, the price pattern shows that the Dogecoin price has been following a controlled downtrend. The selling pressure is consistent, and every rebound so far has been capped by the same resistance around $0.166. The momentum has been drifting downward for most of the past week, keeping the Dogecoin price suppressed below this price level. the most recent candles on the chart show Dogecoin attempted another rebound after a drop into the $0.153 region. BitGuru noted that this bounce is not enough to confirm a reversal, and a stronger recovery will only be confirmed if it breaks above the nearby resistance zone. The current price action in the past few days shows Dogecoin is holding above short-term support, but it has not yet shown the strength required to break out of the sideways-to-downward structure. Until the candles break above the compression zone formed between November 15 and 16, then Dogecoin might continue trading sideways. Dogecoin / TetherUS. Source: BitGuru On X The Resistance Zone Dogecoin Must Break BitGuru’s main focus is the resistance zone that has repeatedly rejected Dogecoin. From the chart, this resistance stretches across the range between $0.163 and $0.167, coinciding with the point where the last two consolidation phases stalled. Each time Dogecoin reached this area, selling pressure increased, creating another correction. Related Reading: Model Shows How XRP Could Hit $24 After ETFs Go Live The chart shows this clearly in the boxed region leading into the November 16 decline, where Dogecoin hovered below $0.16598 for several hours before slipping again. This zone is acting as the barrier preventing Dogecoin from starting a new rally. According to BitGuru, the market needs a clean breakout above this range before any stronger recovery can be confirmed. Without that breakout, the Dogecoin price will still be vulnerable to further downside movement. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.1566 and is well below this resistance block.

    "title": "Ethereum Is Sitting On Its Most Critical On-Chain Support Level — A Rally Emerging?",
    "body": "The cryptocurrency market finds itself at a compelling crossroads, and Ethereum has once again returned to a pivotal on-chain support zone that has historically marked major turning points in its market cycle. With ETH now pressing against this same support, the market is exhibiting a strong reaction that could confirm the integrity of the long-term trend. Why This On-Chain Support Zone Defined Ethereum Recovery Ethereum’s price is sitting right on top of its most important on-chain support, and the behavior around this level is exactly what occurs before a big reversal. A popular crypto news site, CryptosRus, has revealed on X that the ETH price sharply dropped to $2,870 earlier today, only to bounce instantly after Nvidia’s earnings lifted the entire market. CryptoRus highlighted that this bounce isn’t the real story, but the level at which it happened is. Related Reading: Ethereum Big Wallets Are Back: Whales Are Quietly Accumulating ETH – A Rally On The Way? Presently, the $2,800 zone is a strong on-chain floor for ETH. This is because the level lines up perfectly with the realized price of both retail and whales. These are the same zones that have marked the ETH bottoms in every past cycle, and ETH just tapped it perfectly. The classic signature of a bottom-zone behavior is that small wallets are in panic, while big wallets are buying in silence. Meanwhile, the on-chain rotation data has clearly shown that retail holders are selling, while whale investors holding 10,000 ETH and above are steadily loading up. A similar sentiment has been detected in the liquidation data. Long liquidations are barely moving on each new low, which means that the forced sellers are gone and the short sellers have been piling in aggressively. That’s the perfect setup for a squeeze. According to the expert, ETH didn’t just dip; it slammed into a major on-chain support, as large investors bought it up with conviction. Meanwhile, retail dumped it in panic, shorts crowded it, and now even a small bounce can trigger the fireworks. Historical Patterns Suggest A Reset Precedes The Next Expansion Ethereum had just repeated the identical liquidity pattern that occurred at the last two major bottoms, and it happened almost in the same week. An analyst known as Milk Road has stated that every single major ETH reversal started with a full liquidity reset. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Uphill Battle Continues as Sellers Hold the Advantage As that same liquidity reset occurs again, that’s when the ETH price begins its next massive expansion leg, which is exactly the setup ETH is currently in. In the meantime, the next phase will depend entirely on how quickly the market depth can be rebuilt. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",
