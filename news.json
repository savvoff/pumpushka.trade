    "title": "More Eurozone Countries Will Buy Bitcoin, Says Coinbase’s Institutional Chief",
    "body": "An experiment in Prague might end up mattering more for Bitcoin than the usual ETF inflow chart. Speaking on the “Crypto In America” show on 10 December, Coinbase Head of Institutional John D’Agostino highlighted that the Czech National Bank has begun testing Bitcoin in its national treasury and for payments, and argued that this sort of move by a Eurozone central bank is likely to spread. Czech Bitcoin Pilot Could Spread Across Eurozone “The Czech national bank chose very well in their service providers,” he said, adding that the central bank is “putting Bitcoin on their national treasury and they are experimenting with and learning in real time using Bitcoin for payments.” The pilot is small — “a million dollars of Bitcoin” — but for D’Agostino the signal is not in the size, it is in who is doing it and why. He drew a deliberate contrast with earlier sovereign experiments: “No disrespect to El Salvador… this wasn’t a ‘I want to shake up my economy because I’m heading in the wrong direction’… This is, we are a stable Euro zone country… we don’t have to do this.” Related Reading: Standard Chartered Cuts 2026 Bitcoin Price Prediction By 50% Instead, the Czech move followed “all the bells and whistles” of a traditional process: RFPs, vendor selection, formal adoption into policy. That, he suggested, is exactly what makes it dangerous — for the status quo. “That type of thing is contagious and I can see more Euro zone [countries] following suit very very shortly,” he said. The comment did not come in isolation. Throughout the interview, D’Agostino hammered a consistent thesis: institutional adoption has always been less about perfect regulatory clarity and more about liquidity, credible market structure and having the “right” types of participants in the pool. “I’ve always been a bit of a skeptic on the argument that the reason institutions haven’t invested… is regulatory clarity,” he said. Clarity is “top three,” but in his ranking it comes after liquidity and sits alongside alpha potential. If two of the three are present, “people will find a way.” Bitcoin’s spot ETFs, in his view, have already created something the asset previously lacked: a cohort of structurally compelled participants. “The ETFs, in my view, are kind of the surrogate commercial users of Bitcoin,” he argued. They “have to rebalance… it’s codified into their business model,” acting as a stabilizing force similar to industrial users in commodities markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Lacks Fresh Momentum As Realized Cap Growth Still Declining A Eurozone central bank experimenting with Bitcoin on its balance sheet pushes that logic one step further up the food chain. D’Agostino did not spell out a grand theory of “Bitcoin as reserve asset” — he was careful, almost lawyerly, about what he could say — but the implication is not terribly subtle: when a central bank with access to normal EU funding “doesn’t have to do this” and still chooses to, it normalizes Bitcoin inside the most conservative layer of the monetary system. That sits alongside a broader reputational repair job he thinks the industry still has to finish. Crypto, he argued, has had no more structural failures than other markets — he pointed to the London Metal Exchange’s cancellation of billions in nickel trades as an under-discussed parallel to FTX — but “we tend to push the jokers to positions of prominence,” whereas TradFi “does a good job of hiding their jokers.” Between cleaner narratives, ETF-driven “surrogate” demand and now a Eurozone central bank quietly wiring a million dollars into Bitcoin, D’Agostino’s message was that the institutional story is less about a sudden wave and more about erosion. “There’s no wave,” he said earlier in the conversation. “It’s this gradual erosion as opposed to this crashing wave.” If he is right about the Czech experiment being contagious, that erosion may soon be happening from the inside of the Euro system as well, not just from asset managers in New York.

    "title": "Bitcoin Realized Losses From Entities Surges To 2022 Levels Following Crash Below $90,000",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s price action in the past two weeks has opened a new phase of stress among traders, with on-chain data showing realized losses climbing to heights last observed in 2022. Glassnode’s latest Week-On-Chain report shows Bitcoin is trading above an important cost-basis level but is also visibly straining under intensified loss realization, fading demand and weakening liquidity, which has placed short-term investors in a difficult position. Realized Losses Return To Deep Territory According to Glassnode, realized losses among Bitcoin entities have risen massively, and is now almost at the same magnitudes recorded during the deep retracements of the 2022 bear market. Particularly, the Relative Unrealized Loss (30D-SMA) has climbed to 4.4% after nearly two years below 2%. Related Reading: The Current Bitcoin Price Pump Will End In A Crash – Here’s When To Start Selling The escalation in loss realization reflects how the recent drawdown below $90,000 has forced a large number of market participants to offload coins at prices below their acquisition cost. This, in turn, has disrupted the gradual improvement in profitability seen earlier in the year. Bitcoin’s recent bounce from the November 22 low to above $92,000 hasn’t eased the strain on holders. Glassnode noted that entities are still locking in losses at an increasing pace, with the 30-day average of realized losses now at around $555 million per day. These conditions mean that investors are losing confidence in short-term upside prospects for Bitcoin and choose to reduce exposure, even at unfavorable prices. Therefore, the report noted that resolving it will require a renewed wave of liquidity and demand to rebuild confidence. Glassnode also highlights a sharp rise in profit-taking among long-term holders, whose realized gains have climbed to roughly $1 billion per day and briefly set a new record above $1.3 billion. Even with this elevated level of distribution, Bitcoin is currently positioned just above the True Market Mean, which is a long-standing cost-basis benchmark that serves as a point of structural support. The recent price downturn below $90,000 has pushed this zone close to its limits, but the glimpse of demand reflected around it suggests that price could revisit the 0.75 quantile near $95,000 and possibly approach the short-term holder cost basis as well. Spot ETF, Futures, And Options Markets Indicate Weakness Glassnode’s report points to persistent softness across ETF flows, which have cooled notably after a period of strong inflows earlier in the year. This slowdown represents a reduction in one of the largest and most immediate sources of buy-side liquidity for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Why Is The Bitcoin Price Down Again? Analyst Calls Out Trading Desk For Triggering Crashes Spot market liquidity has also faded, with order books on major exchanges near the lower bound of their 30-day range. This has created an environment where trading activity has weakened through November and into December, and fewer liquidity flows are available to absorb volatility or sustain directional moves. Derivatives positioning reflects similar caution, with funding rates pinned near neutral. Futures open interest has also been subdued and has failed to meaningfully rebuild since the breakdown below $90,000. Across all major venues, the tone is the same: liquidity is lighter, sentiment is softening, and participants are leaning defensive rather than pursuing short-term rallies. The attention is now on how Bitcoin will respond in the aftermath of the Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Why Now Is The Perfect Opportunity To Short Bitcoin Down To $40,000",
    "body": "A recent post by crypto analyst Stockmoney Lizards on X suggests that the current Bitcoin structure is giving bears “the perfect opportunity” to short the market down to $40,000. His message was paired with a chart showing Bitcoin falling below an important resistance ever since it broke below $100,000, creating what appears to be a clean continuation setup for traders expecting deeper losses. However, although the chart highlights a similar bearish structure in 2022, the analysis behind his post points to a more layered interpretation of what may come next for Bitcoin. The Setup Bears Believe Is Finally Here In the chart he shared, Stockmoney Lizards showed how Bitcoin’s latest breakdown resembles the 2022 pattern, when the price action rejected a major resistance level and fell sharply into what later became a large accumulation zone. The current structure shows a similar rejection just above the $100,000 zone, followed by a drop below the weekly EMA50. This move has brought Bitcoin into a region that is similar to the range where accumulation formed in the earlier cycle. An overlay of the new price action on top of the previous one shows the path downward seems almost predetermined, creating the impression that the Bitcoin price is setting up a natural decline to as low as $40,000 in the coming weeks and months. Bitcoin is currently trading at $90,240. A crash to $40,000 would mean wiping out roughly 55% of its value from here, effectively erasing the entire progress it has built over the past two years. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: @StockmoneyL On X Why The Perfect Short Is Not The Analyst’s Real Message After the post gained traction, Stockmoney Lizards stepped in to clarify that his message had been taken too literally. His invitation for traders to short down to $40,000 was intentionally exaggerated, and the market does not behave this way. He clarified that he does not foresee a collapse into a deep bear market. Instead, he believes Bitcoin may consolidate, possibly sweep local lows, but not have a prolonged breakdown. Furthermore, he noted that the worst-case scenario would be a touch of the weekly EMA200, and this is not a place where bull markets end. The real midterm prediction is a higher move for the Bitcoin price. Before posting the supposedly bearish prediction, Stockmoney Lizards had shared another analysis describing Bitcoin as being close to the endboss at the weekly EMA50 indicator. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: @StockmoneyL On X That earlier chart offered a clearer view of his actual stance. In it, he predicted that Bitcoin was approaching a major technical pivot and that he expected upward movement into the end of December and Q1 2025. Therefore, the weekly EMA50 is the barrier that Bitcoin needs to reclaim in order to launch its next phase of bullish momentum. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Rise To $14 By Frontrunning Bitcoin By Over 600%",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Javon Marks has provided a bullish outlook for the XRP price, predicting that it could rally to $14, frontrunning Bitcoin in the process. He alluded to a historical trend in which XRP outperformed BTC, which is why the analyst is confident that such price action can play out again. Analyst Predicts XRP Price To Rise To $14, Frontrunning Bitcoin In an X post, Javon Marks stated that the XRP price is set to outpace Bitcoin by over 600% this time around, which could spark a rally to over $14 for the altcoin. He noted that when XRP previously outran Bitcoin by over 240%, its price rose by over 570%. As such, he is confident that this can play out again. Related Reading: XRP Price On The Verge Of Another Crash, But There’s Still Hope The analyst’s accompanying chart shows that this XRP price rally could happen between now and mid-2027, with the altcoin outperforming Bitcoin during this period. Marks, however, failed to mention what could trigger such a price rally for the altcoin, considering that it has mirrored the flagship crypto so far in this market cycle. The XRP price notably has a year-to-date (YTD) loss of just over 7% while Bitcoin has a YTD loss of just under 2%. However, XRP is seeing renewed bullish momentum thanks to the spot ETFs, which launched between last month and this month. The XRP ETFs recently hit $1 billion in assets under management (AuM), becoming the fastest crypto asset to hit this milestone since Ethereum. As Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse noted, this highlights the demand for these crypto products, which could serve as a catalyst for a higher XRP price. Meanwhile, the XRP Ledger could soon see increased adoption following the release of the v3.0.0 upgrade, which could, in turn, boost XRP’s utility. XRP Still At “Decision Point” Crypto analyst CasiTrades noted that the XRP price is still at a decision point. She explained that until XRP breaks above the $2.41 resistance and pushes toward $2.65, the bullish scenario isn’t confirmed. On the other hand, the analyst stated that if the price drops back below $2.04 support, the more bearish path opens toward $1.73 and potentially $1.64, which is the .618 macro support. Related Reading: Betting Big On XRP: Billion-Dollar Asset Manager Confirms What Smart Money Has Been Doing CasiTrades reiterated that nothing has been confirmed for the XRP price as both scenarios are still fully in play. She indicated that this $2.04 is the best price level for traders to enter a position, as it positions them for either scenario. The analyst explained that if the price holds and runs upward, then these market participants are in before the confirmation. Meanwhile, if the price breaks down, they can place a stop just below support or at break-even. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.01, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "title": "XRP Forecast Turns Explosive As Canadian Experts Highlight Massive FinTech Utility",
    "body": "The latest analysis circulating is that the Canadian fintech analysts are becoming increasingly bullish on XRP, pointing to a surge in real-world utility that could reshape the digital payments landscape. The financial institutions have continued to adopt blockchain-based settlement systems. This growing utility has led several Canadian researchers to issue an explosive new forecast. How XRP’s Real-world Utility Is Expanding Faster Than Market Valuations Canada’s fintech landscape is shifting, and XRP is rapidly emerging as one of its most influential digital assets. According to a video shared by crypto analyst Skipper_xrp, a Canadian news article highlighted that XRP could become the most compelling fintech play in the entire crypto sector and that it could reach as high as $2,000 by 2027. Related Reading: XRP Price About $1,000 Is A Necessity, Analyst Claims It is worth noting that XRP is no longer just a speculative asset in Canada. It’s now being viewed by Canadian analysts and market observers as a tangible fintech tool powering real change in cross-border payment, with a clear path to becoming a cornerstone of modern finance by 2027. The article also predicts that XRP could become the strongest fintech play in crypto. Skipper_xrp added that RACO, which is known as the beloved raccoon-themed token, has quickly become one of the most talked-about projects and is making a splash on the XRP Ledger. While RACO is gaining traction as more users adopt it for transactions, it is emerging as a standout choice within the XRPL ecosystem. Furthermore, the RACO tokens are now officially available for community members to get early access and be part of the project’s growth. Why The Financial Institutions Can Now Offer XRP Access With Confidence In a major regulatory breakthrough of the Ripple Ledger, analyst Skipper_xrp has also stated that the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has confirmed that the national banks are now legally permitted to conduct riskless principal transactions in crypto-assets. This riskless principal activity will open the door for the token to be used in these regulated operations and give banks a compliant way to facilitate XRP-based trades and payments. Related Reading: Here’s Why XRP Positions Itself As Treasury-Grade Rail For Institutions Moving Trillions Furthermore, with the OCC’s confirmation, US national banks can now act as intermediaries for XRP transactions in a fully regulated manner without taking any market risk. This makes it easier for institutional and retail clients to access and use XRP through trusted, regulated financial institutions. According to Skipper_xrp, this ruling provides regulatory clarity and gives XRP a competitive edge in the US market, making it the perfect asset for banks to integrate into their service offerings. Such a move could power increased adoption and liquidity for the asset. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "body": "The Shiba Inu community was jolted by an unexpected surge of whale activity this week, involving a staggering $35 million worth of SHIB. The large-scale whale movement not only caught the community’s attention but also prompted a rare public reaction from Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama. After months of silence, Shytoshi has seemingly resurfaced to acknowledge the massive transfer. Shiba Inu Lead Dev Breaks Silence After Massive Whale Move After over three months of silence, Kusama reappeared on X as the Shiba Inu community reacted to a substantial whale movement. His return followed a repost by World Blockchain Capital about the unusually large transfer of 4,136,208,073,220 SHIB from the crypto exchange Coinbase to a private key wallet. Related Reading: 121 Billion Shiba Inu Coins From Exchanges, Where Are They Headed With Prices Down? World Blockchain Capital tagged several members of the Shiba Inu community in the transaction, urging them to take note and highlighting how rare such a move has been recently. The transaction was first identified by market analyst Del Crxpto, who reported that the more than 4 trillion SHIB transfer was worth about $35 million. Typically, when tokens are removed from exchanges and moved to a private wallet address, it often signals strategic accumulation or long-term holding by major investors rather than immediate trading activity. In this case, the size of the transaction ignited bullish sentiment from market watchers, especially in a period where the price is experiencing significant volatility and choppy action. Excluding the shock of the transfer, what really caught the interest of the community was Kusama’s unexpected reappearance. The lead developer had previously explained in an earlier post that his reduced visibility was due to a shift in focus toward other new projects. At the time, he disclosed a new interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) initiatives aimed at advancing the ecosystem. Kusama emphasized that, despite exploring new directions, he continues to work with SHIB developers, including Kaal Dhairya and others, to shape Shiba Inu’s next phase. Analyst Eyes $0.0002 SHIB As Whales Return A new report by market analyst ‘SHIB Crack’ on X reveals that the price of Shiba Inu is showing signs of a massive breakout amid rising market activity. Currently, the SHIB price is in a downtrend, dropping by more than 6% this week and over 16% in the past month. Related Reading: Will The Shiba Inu Price Hit A New All-Time High In 2025? Machine Learning Algorithm Answers Despite this severe downturn, SHIB Crack believes that the cryptocurrency is gearing up for a massive rise $0.00002. At the time of writing, the meme coin is trading at $0.0000082, meaning a surge to the analyst’s projected target would require a gain of over 142% SHIB Crack has attributed his bullish forecast to the recent sharp surge in whale activity. According to the post on X, SHIB whales have reemerged and are silently accumulating tokens, signaling confidence in the token’s potential to rally.

    "title": "Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher",
    "body": "Dogecoin rose 4% to trade at $0.14 Thursday, according to market reports. Market capitalization was about $21 billion while 24-hour trading volume hovered near $1.6 billion. The move followed renewed on-chain activity that has drawn attention from traders and analysts. Related Reading: Institutions Scoop Up 9,000 Ether, Fueling Bullish Signals Spike In Active Wallets Based on reports from BitInfoCharts, the number of daily active addresses on the Dogecoin network jumped to over 67,500 on December 3, marking the second-highest reading in the past three months. That earlier spike on September 15 came as DOGE briefly approached a local top near $0.30. At that time, network activity rose as prices climbed; today, rising wallet activity is being watched closely as prices test a familiar zone after a long slide. Support Holding Near $0.14 Dogecoin is sitting above an important area around $0.138–$0.14, which has been tested and defended multiple times. Reports show the token has bounced off that level before, and trading volume has more than doubled during the most recent uptick, a sign that buying interest is growing. Market feeds also report mixed short-term figures: one line shows the token down by 5% in a week while another notes a 7.5% decline over the last week; those numbers do not align and highlight some reporting inconsistencies. Longer-term data show the token has lost roughly 60% over the past year and is about 50% off its recent highs. Volume And Technical Targets Traders are eyeing $0.16 as the next meaningful resistance. Based on reports, a decisive move above that zone would be the first clear break in the short-term bearish pattern. Beyond that, the 200-day exponential moving average sits as a broader target, often watched for signals that medium-term momentum has shifted. A break above the 200-day EMA would be treated by many as confirmation that a recovery could gain traction, although history shows these signals sometimes reverse quickly. Signals Are Mixed Daily active address spikes can point to rising interest. They can also reflect simple transfers, bot traffic, or wallet reshuffles by large holders. Increased volume helps the case for buyers, but active-address readings alone are not foolproof. The current setup looks like a battleground: both bulls and bears are more active than they were a few weeks ago. That activity makes the coming days important for traders who favor short-term moves.

    "title": "Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds",
    "body": "As the start-of-week momentum slows, Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped 5.5% on the daily timeframe, falling to the recent lows once again. Some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency is setting the stage for a massive short-term and mid-term rally if the retests of current levels hold. Related Reading: Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin Is ‘Climbing Another Wall Of Worry’– Here’s Why Dogecoin Prepares For $1 Milestone On Thursday, Dogecoin followed the rest of the crypto market and retraced to the $0.136-$0.138 levels. The cryptocurrency has retraced around 50% following the Q4 market downturn, trading within the $0.130-$0.155 price range over the past few weeks. Amid this week’s recovery, DOGE’s price briefly tested the local range highs, trying to break out of this area for the second time this month. However, Wednesday’s volatility, driven by the expectations of the Federal Reserve’s rate cut announcement, led to a 4.6% intraday drop before continuing its descent to the current levels. Market observer Trader Tardigrade highlighted the cryptocurrency’s performance, noting that Dogecoin is holding strong at a key support area despite the pullback, which could “potentially set the stage for a massive surge to $1” next year. According to the chart, DOGE is retesting an ascending support zone that has preceded major moves over the past two years. Since late 2023, this support has been retested three times, marking the bottom of each major corrective phase and serving as a “launchpad” to new highs. Notably, the subsequent rally’s size and duration have seen an increasing trend, with the bounces lasting longer and reaching higher levels after each retest of the two-year trendline. During the first rebound, Dogecoin rallied 87% in eight weeks. Meanwhile, DOGE surged by over 210% in ten weeks after retesting this crucial level. Lastly, it registered a 14-week 442% run between Q3 and Q4, 2024, to its multi-year high of $0.48. With the price currently retesting this level once again, the analyst suggested that a rally to the $1 mark could be brewing if the current levels hold. A bounce from this area could kick off a 610% jump at the start of 2026. DOGE’s Rally To September Highs Imminent? The trader also pointed out that DOGE’s MACD Bullish Crossover “is now happening.” He explained that the cryptocurrency’s trend began shifting from a downtrend to an uptrend on Wednesday, suggesting a significant price move is to follow. He previously affirmed that this setup has preceded previous breakouts this year, with the price surging to new local highs in Q2 and Q3 after each MACD bullish cross. As this setup begins to unfold, the analyst’s chart suggests that the price could bounce to the October levels. Similarly, other market observers hinted that Dogecoin could be preparing for a 60%-120% surge in the short term. Analyst Bitcoinsensus highlighted a classic bullish reversal pattern, a falling wedge pattern, that has been forming since October in DOGE’s chart.

If we get a decent breakout above the upper yellow line, we could be targeting the 0.20$ area (+60%),” the analyst stated. Meanwhile, AltCryptoTalk recently noted that Dogecoin is retesting “the same weekly demand zone that sparked every major rally in the past,” which could spark a 115% rally to the $0.30 September high if the area holds. As of this writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.137, an 8% decline in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Whales Refuse to Sell: Historic Signal Emerges As Binance CDD Drops To 2017 Levels",
    "body": "Bitcoin has retraced below the $91,000 level following the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, a move that initially generated volatility across risk assets. While the market’s reaction has leaned bearish in the short term, on-chain data tells a very different story beneath the surface. Related Reading: The Whale Who Can’t Stop Buying: BitcoinOG Scales Ethereum Long To $280M After Price Surge According to new insights from CryptoQuant, one of the most striking signals comes from the Exchange Inflow Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric on Binance, which has fallen sharply to 380, its lowest reading since September 2017. CDD is one of the most important indicators for understanding long-term holder behavior because it assigns greater weight to older coins that have accumulated more “coin days.” Low values mean that the BTC moving onto exchanges is predominantly from short-term traders, not long-term holders. In other words, veteran holders — the investors who historically move markets — are refusing to sell, even as Bitcoin trades near cycle highs. Long-Term Holders Signal Strong Conviction CryptoOnchain highlights that the significance of this CDD collapse becomes far clearer when viewed against Bitcoin’s current price context. With BTC trading near $89,600, the market is witnessing an unusually large divergence between price action and long-term holder behavior. Historically, when Bitcoin approaches or surpasses all-time highs, long-held coins tend to move — triggering spikes in CDD as early investors and whales take profits. This pattern has repeated across past cycles, making elevated CDD a classic top-signal. But this time, the exact opposite is happening. Instead of old coins entering exchanges, Exchange Inflow CDD is collapsing, indicating that almost none of the BTC being deposited onto Binance comes from long-term wallets. CryptoOnchain explains that this phenomenon strongly suggests that Smart Money and long-term whales have zero interest in selling at these levels, even after a multi-month correction. This refusal to distribute supply removes a major source of overhead resistance and reflects a market dynamic driven increasingly by strong hands. The absence of long-term sell pressure reduces the available liquid supply, often preceding powerful bullish expansions. In simple terms, whales are signaling confidence — not caution — despite short-term volatility, reinforcing the narrative that Bitcoin may be preparing for its next major move. Related Reading: Why Ethereum’s Rally Isn’t Overheated – And Where Demand Must Grow Next Bitcoin Price Action: Testing Support Amid Weak Momentum Bitcoin’s 3-day chart shows the market stabilizing just above the $90,000 level after last week’s sharp post-FED decline. Price remains compressed between the 200-day moving average (red line)—currently acting as primary support—and the 100-day moving average (green line) overhead, which continues to cap upward momentum. This creates a classic squeeze structure where BTC is holding its ground but struggling to reclaim lost trend levels. The recent candle structure highlights a series of higher lows forming near the $89K–$90K region, suggesting buyers are defending this zone as a short-term floor. However, the rejection from the 100-day MA reinforces the broader bearish shift, as BTC remains below both key trend indicators and is yet to reclaim the breakdown level around $100K. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Largest Binance Inflow Since 2023 – Warning Sign? Volume also tells an important story: despite the bounce, buy-side conviction appears weak. The rebound has not been accompanied by a spike in demand, indicating that market participants are cautious following the rate cut and macro uncertainty. If Bitcoin loses the 200-day MA, the next major support lies closer to $84K, which would open the door to a deeper retracement. Conversely, a decisive close above the 100-day MA near $98K would signal momentum returning to the bulls. For now, BTC remains in a fragile consolidation with limited directional strength.

    "body": "Ethereum price started a fresh increase above $3,15 0. ETH is now consolidating and might soon aim for a clear upside break above $3,350. Ethereum started a downside correction from the $3,450 zone. The price is trading above $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,180 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below the $3,150 zone. Ethereum Price Holds Support Ethereum price managed to stay above $3,150 and started a fresh increase, beating Bitcoin . ETH price gained strength for a move above the $3,300 and $3,320 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above $3,400. However, the bears were active below $3,450. A high was formed at $3,448 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below $3,250, and the price even spiked below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,914 swing low to the $3,448 low. However, the bulls were active near $3,150. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . Besides, there is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,180 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If there is another upward move, the price could face resistance near the $3,290 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,320 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,350 level. A clear move above the $3,350 resistance might send the price toward the $3,400 resistance. An upside break above the $3,400 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,450 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,320 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,200 level. The first major support sits near the $3,150 zone. A clear move below the $3,150 support might push the price toward the $3,040 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,020 region. The next key support sits at $3,000.

    "title": "Report Reveals 65% Of Bitcoin Treasury Companies Struggling With Major Unrealized Losses",
    "body": "A recent report from BitcoinTreasuries.Net highlights significant challenges faced by Bitcoin-focused treasury companies since November. The findings revealed that the vast majority of these firms are now grappling with substantial unrealized losses, prompting many to sell off considerable amounts of their Bitcoin holdings. Market Struggles Continue In a sample analysis of 100 companies with reliable cost basis measurements, approximately 65% purchased Bitcoin at prices that now exceed the current market value, leaving a considerable number of these treasuries with substantial unrealized losses. Bitcoin’s market downturn in late November pushed spot prices down towards $90,000, leaving many buyers from 2025 at a financial disadvantage. Related Reading: Bitcoin Outlook Post Fed’s 0.25% Rate Cut: Historical Patterns And Predictions Now, the market’s leading crypto has retraced below this key level on Thursday, even despite the Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut announcement. Among the companies surveyed, about two-thirds are found to be sitting on unrealized losses based on current market values. But despite the volatility in pricing, some of the largest balance sheets continued to acquire Bitcoin. Notably, firms like Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) and Strive significantly contributed to net additions in November, with Strategy accounting for approximately 75% of all monthly purchases following their sell-offs. Mining companies remain steadfast as a cornerstone of public market Bitcoin holdings. In November, they represented about 5% of new additions to the market and around 12% of the total balances held by public companies. Bitcoin Demand Remains Strong Even as Bitcoin treasury stocks have shown softness compared to Bitcoin itself and broader equity benchmarks, many companies still pursued strategies to add BTC to their balance sheets while refining their capital-market approaches. BitcoinTreasury.Net’s analysis indicates that nearly 50 firms have managed to achieve gains of at least 10% over the last 6 to 12 months. Over time, losses have begun to soften for some. Currently, around 140 companies have experienced declines of at least 10% over a 1 to 3 month period, while about 105 companies have seen similar declines year-to-date. However, not all corporate holders opted to weather the storm of price fluctuations. In November alone, at least five companies decided to sell Bitcoin, with Sequans leading the charge by offloading roughly one-third of its holdings.

This figure is notably below the totals from each of the prior four quarters and aligns closely with the additions seen in the third quarter of 2024. The report concluded that despite a clear easing in the “summer buying frenzy,” demand for Bitcoin has not entirely diminished as public corporations are adapting to a more cautious and selective approach as they reassess their recent purchases. At the time of writing, BTC traded at $89,920, down over 2% in the previous 24 hours. This places the cryptocurrency 27% behind its all-time high of $126,000 set in October of this year.

XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.050 zone. The price is now trading below $2.050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.040 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below $2.00. XRP Price Struggles Near Resistance XRP price attempted a recovery wave above $2.150 but failed to continue higher, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price started a fresh decline below $2.080 and $2.050. There was a move below the $2.00 support level. A low was formed at $1.993, and the price recently started an upside correction. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.177 swing high to the $1.993 low. However, the bears are active near $2.040 and $2.050. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.040 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.040 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.080 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.177 swing high to the $1.993 low. A close above $2.080 could send the price to $2.012. The next hurdle sits at $2.150. A clear move above the $2.150 resistance might send the price toward the $2.1850 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.220 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.250. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.040 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.00 level. The next major support is near the $1.9880 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.9880 level, the price might continue to decline toward $1.920. The next major support sits near the $1.880 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.820. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

    "title": "Stellar (XLM) Forms Signal That Last Led To 95% Price Rally",
    "body": "A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how Stellar has just seen a TD Sequential buy signal. Here’s what happened the last time the pattern surfaced. Stellar Shot Up The Last Time A TD Buy Signal Appeared At Current Prices In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential signal that has appeared in the 1-week price of Stellar. The TD Sequential is a technical analysis (TA) indicator that’s used for pinpointing locations of probable reversal in an asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Lacks Fresh Momentum As Realized Cap Growth Still Declining The indicator involves two phases. In both of them, it works by counting up candles of the same polarity (that is, whether red or green) in the asset’s chart. These candles don’t have to be consecutive. During the first phase, called the setup, this count runs until nine candles of a color are in. Once the indicator finishes the setup, the price can be assumed to have reached a potential point of turnaround. Naturally, this signal is a bullish one if the candles leading up to the setup’s completion were red. On the other hand, it’s bearish in the case of nine green candles. As soon as the setup is over, the second phase, known as the countdown, kicks off. In this phase, the candle count runs until 13. After the countdown is over, the asset could be considered to have arrived at another reversal. The TD Sequential has just completed the former of the two phases for Stellar. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows this pattern forming in the weekly XLM price. As displayed in the graph, Stellar has formed the latest TD Sequential setup with nine red candles, implying that the downtrend may be reaching a state of exhaustion and a bullish reversal could be due for the asset. Interestingly, this isn’t the first time that XLM has shown a TD Sequential buy signal at the current price levels during the last few months. From the chart, it’s visible that this pattern also emerged when the cryptocurrency was trading at similar levels in March. That setup in the indicator eventually led to a price surge of 95% for Stellar. Given this trend, it’s possible that the latest signal could also prove to be bullish for XLM. Related Reading: Solana Enters Bear Territory: Realized Loss Now Outweighs Profit Something to note, however, is that the TD Sequential setup didn’t immediately lead into the big price rally back then; it took a while of consolidation before the breakout appeared. It now remains to be seen whether the indicator will hold for Stellar this time, and if so, how long a rally will take to appear. XLM Price At the time of writing, Stellar is trading around $0.243, down more than 4% over the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, charts from TradingView.com",

    "body": "On Thursday, Bitcoin (BTC) once again fell below the critical $90,000 mark, even after what many had anticipated to be a bullish event stemming from the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) decision to cut rates by a quarter point. Analysts from Bull Theory note several factors contributing to this unexpected downturn. Bitcoin Sell-Off Amid Market Unease The analysts pointed out that the rate cut itself was largely anticipated by investors weeks prior, with a 95% probability already priced into the market. Ahead of the announcement, they identified that many positioned themselves in expectation of some form of liquidity support from the Fed, leading to a rally in Bitcoin prices. However, when the actual cut and the accompanying plan for $40 billion in monthly T-bill purchases were confirmed, many of these “whales”—large investors in the market—began to take profits. Related Reading: Strategy Calls For Withdrawal Of MSCI’s Exclusion Plan For Digital Asset Treasury Companies Adding to the market’s unease was Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post-announcement press conference, where he highlighted persistent weaknesses in the labor market and ongoing inflation concerns. Furthermore, the Fed’s dot plot projections indicated the likelihood of only one additional rate cut in 2026. The situation was compounded by disappointing earnings results from Oracle, which reported its second quarter’s financials after the market’s close. The tech giant missed its adjusted revenue estimates, and higher capital expenditure projections led the stock to plunge by more than 11% in after-hours trading. This drop also negatively impacted US stock futures, as concerns grew that the artificial intelligence (AI) boom may be peaking. The widespread fear from Oracle’s results quickly spread from equities into the cryptocurrency space. Ultimately, all three factors converged to create a significant sell-off: the rate cut was already factored into the market, liquidity trades had been preemptively enacted, and Powell’s remarks did not provide the strong easing signal that some traders had hoped for. Positive Liquidity Conditions Expected In 2026 Interestingly, Bull Theory analysts assert that the crypto market’s recent decline is not indicative of a fundamental shift towards bearish conditions but rather an overreaction based on high expectations leading up to the Fed’s announcement. The Fed has now enacted rate cuts three times in as many meetings, and their plans to purchase $40 billion in T-bills over the next month are designed to inject liquidity into the markets. Moreover, Powell indicated that further rate hikes are not on the horizon as a base case, and forecasts for solid economic growth next year remain intact.

The current market movements illustrate that the dumping of assets was largely driven by overly optimistic expectations rather than any deterioration in underlying fundamentals. Looking ahead, the analysts believe that next year is expected to be more favorable for Bitcoin and broader crypto prices in terms of liquidity, contrasting sharply with the conditions projected for 2025. Bitcoin recovered above $91,100 as of this writing, amid rising volatility. This puts the top cryptocurrency 26% behind its all-time high of $126,000, set in October of this year.

    "title": "Solana Will ‘Flip’ Ethereum, Predicts Skybridge Capital’s Scaramucci",
    "body": "Anthony Scaramucci showed up to Solana Breakpoint in Abu Dhabi wearing a tie — a small act of rebellion in a sea of hoodies — and then proceeded to make a much bigger one on stage: Solana is going to “flip” Ethereum. Scaramucci’s Solana Prediction Not in the Twitter-war, zero-sum, “ETH is dead” kind of way. More like: same league, different growth curve, and Solana ends up with the bigger market cap. “I think it will flip Ethereum, but that doesn’t mean Ethereum’s going down or anything like that. I think there’s going to be market share for Ethereum. I think they could both grow, but I think from a market capitalization perspective, I think Solana will end up growing faster,” Scaramucci told CoinDesk Live on Dec. 11. That’s been his line for a while. This time it came with a prop: his new book, Solana Rising, which dropped Dec. 9 and — according to Scaramucci — quickly hit the top of Amazon’s “new releases” list for investment management/investment strategy. He framed the book as something for the skeptics, or at least for the friends of the believers. Related Reading: Solana Enters Bear Territory: Realized Loss Now Outweighs Profit The pitch is familiar if you’ve been anywhere near crypto conferences this year, but Scaramucci’s version is unusually blunt: Solana is the fastest-growing chain, it’s stacked with activity, it’s cheap to use, and it’s easy to build on. Then you add staking, and you’ve got what he keeps calling “great tokenomics.” And yes, he’s heavily aligned. “Full disclosure,” he said, “I have a large personal holding in Solana. I have it on the firm’s balance sheet.” How large? On SkyBridge’s balance sheet, he put it at “probably 60%,” with the firm sitting on “north of a nine figure balance sheet.” His personal portfolio allocation, he estimated, is around “6% 7%.” Big, but not “I sold the house for SOL” big. Notably, Scaramucci emphasized that he’s not “chain monogamous.” He likes Avalanche. He likes Ethereum. He’s not doing maximalism. He’s doing a portfolio. “In fact, who is chain monogamous?” he joked. Related Reading: Solana Hits Critical Demand Zone — Is A Surprise Bottom Loading? The Skybridge Capital founder added: “It’s not an amorous thing. It just has to do with the realities of investing. It’s like owning a lot of stocks in your portfolio. But to me, I just think that it is the fastest growing chain. That’s the most activity of like the top 50 chains combined. It’s got lots of use cases, lots of versatility. It’s easy to develop on and it’s very low fees to transact on and it’s got great tokenomics if you want to stake your Solana like I do.” He also pointed to the debut of the first spot Solana ETF in the United States — “first staking ETF,” in his words — as another signal that we’re still early. Then came the price talk, because of course it did. Could SOL hit $300–$400 by the end of next year? “Sure,” he said, tying it to a more constructive US regulatory backdrop — specifically his hope that the CLARITY Act gets passed and unlocks “the full utilization of tokenization.” Longer term, he went bigger: “Is Solana go to $1,000 over the next five years? I really do believe that.” He also revisited Bitcoin. Same vibe: right call, wrong calendar. “I’ve been right about Bitcoin, but I’ve been wrong about timing,” Scaramucci said, sticking with a $150,000–$200,000 target, and arguing a friendlier rate environment next year could help. At press time, SOL traded at $139.14. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Do Kwon, the South Korean co-founder of Terraform Labs, was sentenced to 15 years in prison on December 11, 2025 in a Manhattan federal court after pleading guilty to fraud tied to the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin and its sister token, Luna. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher According to court documents and news reports, the judge described the scheme as a massive fraud that left thousands of investors facing heavy losses. Sentence And Court Ruling Judge Paul A. Engelmayer handed down the 15-year term after prosecutors urged for a sentence of up to 12 years and the defense asked for a much lighter term. Do Kwon pleaded guilty in August 2025 to conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud, and as part of the plea he agreed to forfeit roughly $19 million. The US Attorney’s office says the guilty plea admits he misled investors about how the stablecoin kept its $1 peg. Scale Of The Losses Reports have placed the market fallout from the Terra collapse at about $40 billion in erased value. Many ordinary investors lost life savings and some victims gave emotional testimony at sentencing, describing real financial ruin. News outlets and court filings tie the crash in May 2022 to a sudden loss of confidence that cascaded through markets and hurt other crypto firms. Civil Penalties And Settlements Before the criminal case reached this point, Kwon and Terraform faced a major civil action from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the SEC, Terraform Labs and Kwon agreed to pay more than $4.5 billion in disgorgement, interest and penalties, while Kwon personally faced an $80 million civil fine and a ban from crypto trading. That civil judgment was filed in 2024 and has been used by regulators as part of the overall effort to make investors whole. International Arrest And Extradition Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 after leaving Singapore; authorities say he was using forged travel documents when detained. He fought extradition in Montenegrin courts but was eventually transferred to the US late in 2024 to face federal charges. Reports outline a long legal fight across borders that ended with his return to New York to answer criminal counts. Related Reading: American Bitcoin Makes Big Buy, Adds 416 BTC To Its Stack What The Sentence Means Legal analysts say a 15-year term signals the court’s view that the fraud caused wide damage and that punishment should deter similar schemes. Victims’ statements at sentencing appear to have weighed heavily. Kwon still faces separate probes and possible charges in other countries, and the civil judgment means substantial sums are earmarked for recovery efforts tied to Terraform’s bankruptcy.
