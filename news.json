    "title": "Ethereum Records $960M Inflow To Break 5-Month Negative Streak – Details",
    "body": "Recent on-chain data revealed a major shift in Ethereum net flow to the Binance exchange during December 2024. This eye-catching event could imply several market developments, especially following the asset’s bearish struggles in Q4 2025. Meanwhile, Ethereum has notably opened 2026 on a positive note, climbing to above $3,100 for the first time since mid-December. Related Reading: Ethereum Finds Its Footing Again, But Here’s Why Bulls Still Have Work To Do Ethereum Sees $960M Inflows As Investor Sentiment Shifts In a QuickTake post on December 3, the analysis page CryptoOnChain reports an important change in Ethereum investors’ activity. Notably, the Ethereum net inflow in December reached $960 million on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. The development is particularly important and compelling because it represents an impressive shift from the negative inflow record that had existed since July 2025. For the majority of H2 2025, investors had chosen to continually withdraw more ETH than deposit, likely in favour of long-term accumulation, i.e., bullish, or to divert potential selling pressure elsewhere. However, the figures recorded in December suggest an abrupt change in investors’ behavior, which bears multiple possible implications for the market. Generally, increased exchange inflows are considered a bearish signal interpreted as market participants’ preparation for a potential asset offload. Considering ETH price struggles in Q4 2025, this recent spike in net inflows could be indicative of a potential repositioning for an anticipated long-term bear market. However, CryptoOnChain highlights some possible positive effects of this event. The huge inflows recorded in December could also reflect a revival in buyer interest, suggesting renewed demand for Ethereum as investors prepare to accumulate at lower price levels. In addition, the heavy net inflows could also represent a new capital injection in the Ethereum market that has been moved to exchanges for active trading. In line with this thought, CryptoOnChain also states that traders may be moving capital to exchanges to capitalize on trading opportunities driven by an expected high volatility. In conclusion, the analysts emphasize that the sudden reversal leading to the massive inflows in December is a vital market signal potentially indicating a new phase of accumulation or heightened trading activity.

    "body": "US Rep. Ritchie Torres said he will introduce legislation to curb what he and other lawmakers describe as possible insider trading on prediction markets, after a single, highly timed wager on Polymarket paid off when Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was captured. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Altcoins Post Another Losing Year: Analyst Reports have disclosed that the bill — being called the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026 — would bar federally elected officials, political appointees and executive branch staff from trading on event markets when they hold material nonpublic information. Public Integrity In Focus According to reporting, a newly created Polymarket account placed roughly $32,500 in bets on a contract that asked whether Maduro would be out of power by January 31, 2026. That stake bought about 438,000 shares when the market price was as low as $0.07 per share late Friday. Within about 24 hours, after action by US forces and an announcement by US President Donald Trump, the position surged—returning more than $400,000 to the account. NEW — RITCHIE TORRES (D-N.Y.) will introduce a bill on this. Bill will be called the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026 Description, per a source: This bill prohibits federal elected officials, political appointees, and Executive Branch employees… https://t.co/eZZ9BmAMgJ — Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) January 3, 2026 The trade’s timing set off immediate questions. Social media users and some investors flagged the purchase as suspicious because it came hours before the public announcement. Observers noted that prediction markets can move quickly on small flows of information, and that enforcement rules vary across platforms. Reports note that other markets, like Kalshi, had priced similar outcomes at roughly $0.13, underlining how unexpected the outcome was to many traders. A newly created Polymarket account invested over $30,000 yesterday in Maduro’s exit. The US then took Maduro into custody overnight, and the trader profited $400,000 in less than 24 hours. Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged. https://t.co/EtZyW1IWTa pic.twitter.com/MzsU9kOU73 — Joe Pompliano (@JoePompliano) January 3, 2026 How The Bill Would Work Torres’s proposal would adapt principles from existing rules that limit trading by officials in traditional securities markets and extend them to online prediction exchanges. The draft language aims to make it unlawful for covered government figures to trade on contracts tied to government actions or political events when they possess nonpublic information because of their official roles. The measure would also task regulators with clarifying which platforms are covered and how violations would be enforced. Market Reaction And Questions Platform operators have long said their terms forbid trading on material nonpublic information, but critics say those rules are hard to police in real time. Some analysts and lawmakers argue that this episode shows a gap between written policies and effective oversight. Others warn against overreach that could stifle legitimate market activity used for forecasting and research.

    "title": "Bitcoin Price To Reclaim $100K In Imminent 15% Move — Here’s How",
    "body": "The Bitcoin price had more of a mixed performance than an outright negative showing in 2025. The market leader made a play for a new all-time high above $100,000 as early as January, but struggled to keep its six-figure valuation as the year wound down. The Bitcoin price has started the new year in a similar fashion to 2025, making its way above the $90,000 mark. However, the market uncertainty is at a record high, with no one knowing what to expect from the digital asset market in 2026. BTC Price Consolidating In Symmetrical Triangle — What Next? In a January 3 post on the social media platform X, market analyst Ali Martinez painted a bullish picture for the Bitcoin price. The crypto pundit postulated that the world’s largest cryptocurrency could be gearing up for an upward 15% price move in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Rally To All-Time Highs If It Breaks This Resistance Level The rationale behind this optimistic prediction is the appearance of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour timeframe of the Bitcoin price chart. The symmetrical triangle is a technical analysis pattern characterized by a diagonal falling upper trendline (connecting the swing highs) and a diagonally rising lower trendline (along the swing lows). In this symmetrical triangle chart formation, the asset price (BTC, in this case) typically contracts and moves toward the apex. The Bitcoin price eventually breaches either the upper trendline for a breakout or crosses the lower boundary, forming a breakdown. Hence, the symmetrical triangle pattern could provide a continuation or reversal signal depending on the direction of the break. It is worth mentioning that symmetrical triangles tend to be continuation break patterns, meaning the price tends to break in the initial trend direction before entering into the triangle pattern. If this theory holds in the current scenario, the Bitcoin price is likely to continue its upward movement after breaking the upper trendline here. The critical resistance in the upper trendline lies around the $91,000 region, and the flagship cryptocurrency needs a sustained close of at least two candlesticks above this level to confirm a bullish breakout. The price target is determined by adding the length of the widest point of the triangle (or base) to the breakout point. Based on this calculation, Martinez put forward a target above $102,000 for the Bitcoin price, representing a 15% surge from the current price point. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands around $91,560, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past 24 hours.

    "title": "Dogecoin Enters Crucial Accumulation Zone — DOGE Price To $0.2?",
    "body": "After a difficult end to 2025, the altcoin market looks set to take the lead in the new year, being the most significant beneficiary from the recent post-holiday rally. Dogecoin, the largest meme coin by market capitalization, has jumped by nearly 24% since the turn of the year. According to the latest on-chain data, the price of Dogecoin appears to be in a critical region at the moment. The relevance of this zone suggests that the meme coin may be merely at the start of an extended upward trend over the next few months. Is It Time To Buy DOGE? In a January 3 post on X, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson said that Dogecoin has entered its most important accumulation zone. This on-chain observation is based on the recent changes in the CVDD (Cumulative Value Days Destroyed) Channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio Flips Into Negative Territory— Is The Recovery Back On? For context, the CVDD Channel is an on-chain indicator that tracks the volume of aged capital being sent into the market (Dogecoin, in this case). This metric is typically used in highlighting zones of long-term support or resistance based on the movement of aged coins on-chain. Wedson highlighted in his post that the CVDD channels depend on Fibonacci-based levels on top of the CVDD curve. This metric creates historical value zones where price tends to react; with the blue CVDD lines, for instance, acting as strong structural support for the price of Dogecoin. As observed in the chart above, DOGE’s recent surge to around $0.15 came after its price bounced from the first blue level. In essence, these lower blue levels have historically proven to be good support cushions for the Dogecoin price. According to Wedson, the lower CVDD Fibonacci zones often coincide with long-term accumulation phases for Dogecoin. Hence, it might be time to accumulate the meme coin, especially as its price is wedged within the blue CVDD zones. Dogecoin Price Outlook 2026 As of this writing, the price of DOGE stands at around 0.1415, reflecting an over 2% jump in the past 24 hours. A broader look at the chart shows that Dogecoin seems to be heating up at the moment. According to data from CoinGecko, the meme coin’s value has increased by more than 15% in the last seven days.

One Of The ‘Greatest Blessings’ We’ll See In Our Lifetime, Analyst Says Following its red-hot action to kickstart the new year, the price of Dogecoin looks set for a positive run in 2026.

    "title": "Crypto Users Lose Far Less To Phishing As Losses Drop 83% – Details",
    "body": "Crypto phishing losses plunged in 2025, but experts warn the threat has only changed shape rather than disappeared. Reports show a sharp fall in money stolen by wallet-draining scams, even as attackers tested new tricks tied to recent protocol changes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Altcoins Post Another Losing Year: Analyst Scam Sniffer Data Shows Drop According to Scam Sniffer’s 2025 analysis, wallet drainer phishing losses fell to about $83.85 million — an 83% decline from roughly $494 million in 2024. The number of affected wallets dropped to around 106,000, a fall of about 68% year-on-year. These figures come from the security platform’s annual study and were picked up by major crypto outlets. Attackers Shift, Not Stop Only 11 incidents topped $1 million in 2025, down from 30 the prior year, signaling fewer headline grabs but a rise in smaller hits. The largest single theft recorded last year was roughly $6.5 million, tied to a malicious Permit signature attack. Average losses per victim fell to roughly $790, which suggests attackers moved toward more frequent, lower-value strikes. Market Moves Mattered Losses followed market activity. The third quarter logged the highest damage at about $31 million, when Ethereum’s rally brought more users and approvals onchain. Monthly peaks included August, which posted about $12.17 million, while December was the quietest with roughly $2 million. That pattern shows fraudsters target busy trading windows. 1/ Ever woken up to an empty crypto wallet? With scammers draining $107K+ across EVM chains JUST THIS WEEK (per @zachxbt), it’s scarier than ever! Shoutout to @realscamsniffer for their 2025 report – losses down 83%, but threats are evolving FAST. Let’s recap & warn on 2026… https://t.co/uSerpsg80d — JP (@rugpullfinder) January 3, 2026 Permit Signatures And New Vectors Reports highlighted Permit and Permit2 signature abuses as a major driver of big losses, accounting for a large share of multi-million cases. Scam Sniffer also flagged EIP-7702 batch signature techniques that were used in a few complex attacks after network upgrades. Security teams say these methods exploit user approval flows rather than raw smart-contract bugs. Why The Drop Happened Analysts attribute much of the improvement to better wallet warnings, wider use of approval revocation tools, and more active tracking by onchain monitors. Some defenders also point to reduced market froth in parts of the year, which lowered the pool of high-value targets. Still, multiple outlets stress that reduced totals do not equal safety. Related Reading: A Maduro Bet, A Market Alarm: US Lawmaker Targets Trading Abuses Based on reports, phishing will likely remain cyclical: losses could spike again during big rallies or when new signing features are introduced. Security firms urge users to check approvals, avoid blind signing, and use wallet tools that flag risky requests. Regulators and exchanges are watching the trend, but responsibility for many attacks still falls to individual users and wallet software. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "$18 Million Ethereum Loss Sends Whale Running To Gold",
    "body": "A large crypto wallet that recently took a sharp loss on Ethereum has restructured its holdings, moving away from volatile tokens and increasing exposure to stablecoins and tokenized gold, according to on-chain tracking data. Related Reading: A Maduro Bet, A Market Alarm: US Lawmaker Targets Trading Abuses The address drew attention after an aggressive Ethereum purchase late last year went wrong. Between November 3 and November 7, 2025, the wallet spent about $110 million to acquire 31,005 ETH at an average price of $3,581. As prices slid, the position was unwound. Nearly the entire holding was sold for roughly $92.19 million, locking in a loss close to $18 million within two weeks. At current prices near $3,020, that same Ethereum stack would now be valued at around $93.6 million. Shift Away From Ether After Costly Exit Based on reports from blockchain monitoring platforms, the sell-off marked a clear change in behavior. The wallet, once heavily tied to Ethereum, no longer holds a large directional bet on the asset. Instead, balances have been spread across cash-like tokens and commodities. The move reflects caution rather than an attempt to quickly recover losses. An unknown whale, who lost $18.8M on $ETH in just 2 weeks, has abandoned $ETH and rotated into #gold. The whale has spent $14.58M to buy 3,299 $XAUT at $4,421 over the past 7 hours.https://t.co/hit6agWmHd pic.twitter.com/X7k94zV0iQ — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 2, 2026 Gold Buying Shows Preference For Lower Volatility According to on-chain records, the address began building a position in Tether’s tokenized gold product, XAUT. Starting on Friday, the wallet spent $14.58 million in USDT to buy 3,299 XAUT across several transactions. The average purchase price came in near $4,421 per token. This was not the first gold buy. A smaller XAUT acquisition was made on December 13, roughly three weeks earlier. As of the latest data, the wallet holds 3,386 XAUT tokens worth about $14.92 million. The broader portfolio now totals close to $91 million. About $58 million sits in USDT, another $18 million is held in USDC, while the remainder is split between XAUT and a reduced Ethereum balance. The composition points to capital protection rather than high-risk positioning. Metals Outperform Crypto In 2025 Returns from last year help explain the change. Reports have disclosed that Bitcoin fell by 6% in 2025, while Ethereum dropped 11%. Over the same period, gold surged over 60%, and silver rose an even steeper 147%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Altcoins Post Another Losing Year: Analyst Major stock indexes such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq 100 also posted stronger performance than much of the crypto market. With those results in view, some investors appear more comfortable holding assets linked to metals or cash. Meanwhile, analysts at asset manager VanEck have pointed to 2026 as a possible recovery year for the crypto market. Their view contrasts with the current behavior of large wallets moving into stablecoins and gold-linked tokens. The divide shows how uncertain sentiment remains after a year when metals and traditional assets delivered stronger gains than major cryptocurrencies.
