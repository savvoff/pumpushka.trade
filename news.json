    "title": "XRP Becomes Most Bought Digital Asset, Bitcoin And Ethereum Bleed $500 Million",
    "body": "XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum are displaying sharply diverging fund flow trends, with XRP emerging as the most accumulated digital asset in the latest CoinShares Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report. With Bitcoin and Ethereum jointly recorded nearly $500 million in outflows, the data illustrates a shift in investor positioning away from the market’s largest assets toward select alternatives amid ongoing volatility. XRP Inflows Highlight Selective Demand Contrasting sharply with the redemptions sweeping through Bitcoin and Ethereum products, XRP has continued to register major inflows. CoinShares data shows XRP-linked investment vehicles attracted $70.2 million in new capital last week, reflecting ongoing interest from investors in these nascent ETF categories. Since their mid-October US launches, XRP has accumulated about $1.07 billion in inflows, a remarkable trajectory given the prevailing outflow environment for larger assets. Related Reading: XRP Price May Be Bearish Below $2, But On-Chain Data Tells A Different Story This bifurcation in fund flows underscores a selective repositioning among investors. While broad risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum grapple with selling pressure, XRP’s performance shows that certain niche products are still attracting interest even in a downtrend. This pattern may be likely due to different expectations about regulations, adoption, or the impact of newly launched ETF products aimed at specific investors. Bit-Heavy Outflows: Bitcoin And Ethereum Under Pressure Despite their dominant roles in the market, Bitcoin and Ethereum endured significant net outflows during the reporting week ended December 29, contributing the lion’s share of the overall outflow figure. According to CoinShares, Bitcoin-linked products recorded approximately $443 million in redemptions, representing nearly the totality of the weekly withdrawal from crypto investment vehicles. Ethereum-focused products also saw $59.5 million exit, adding to a broader pattern of institutional caution toward the largest digital assets. These negative flows have accumulated since the mid-October US ETF launches, with Bitcoin recording roughly $2.8 billion and Ethereum about $1.6 billion in outflows over this period. The concentration of redemptions in the United States, where $460 million left digital asset funds, highlights a prevailing aversion among domestic investors toward reallocating capital into BTC and ETH during periods of price volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Related Reading: Banks Could Start Holding XRP Due To This Simple Change The sustained outflows amid weak sentiment reflect broader investor behavior during market stress. When capital flees established assets, it often signals profit-taking, risk reduction, or shifts into alternative strategies or cash positions, all of which can exert downward price pressure and prolong short-term weakness. For Bitcoin and Ethereum, this trend suggests that even their extensive adoption and liquidity have not insulated them from pullbacks in institutional demand. Overall, the latest fund flow data signals a clear rotation in investor attention. While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to experience significant outflows, XRP is drawing capital, emphasizing a market environment where targeted assets are increasingly capturing the focus of both institutional and retail participants as 2026 approaches.

    "title": "XRP Enters The Same Zone That Preceded Its Last Historic Breakout – What To Know",
    "body": "XRP is once again trading in a zone that closely mirrors the conditions seen before its last historic breakout, drawing fresh attention from market watchers. Key momentum indicators suggest selling pressure is fading, while long-term holders appear to be quietly absorbing supply. Although price action remains cautious for now, the setup is sparking discussions about whether XRP is positioning itself for another major move once market confidence returns. A Rare Momentum Reset On The Higher Timeframe In a significant technical development on XRP’s high-timeframe charts, Steph is Crypto has highlighted that the Stochastic RSI on the 3-week interval has plummeted to a value of 0.00. This level represents a state of total compression for the oscillator, signaling a momentum shift that is rare in the asset’s trading history. Related Reading: XRP Price Trims Upside, Slow Decline Signals Seller Dominance The rarity of this signal cannot be overstated, as it has occurred only once before at the absolute depths of the 2022 bear market. Historically, when the indicator reaches zero, it serves as a definitive marker that the prevailing selling pressure has reached a point of total exhaustion. From a structural perspective, it indicates that the energy behind the downward trend has completely dried up. It is important to note that this does not guarantee an immediate recovery. When this technical phenomenon surfaced in previous cycles, it preceded a prolonged accumulation phase. During that period, the price stabilized as smart money began to build positions, creating a foundation for the next major impulsive move toward the upside. Seeing this signal reappear now suggests that XRP’s downside risk is structurally limited at current valuations. It points to a market environment where long-term holders are actively absorbing the available supply, transitioning from a distribution phase to a period of strategic positioning. A Familiar Market Rhythm Is Emerging on XRP’s Long-Term Chart Altcoin Pioneers, in a recent update, highlighted a striking fractal pattern forming on XRP’s chart, suggesting that history may be repeating with remarkable accuracy. A 3-day chart comparison reveals strong similarities between the 2016–2017 market cycle and the current structure, both shaped by a prolonged ABC corrective phase before a major breakout. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Inflows Spike To End 2025: Will Price Decline Deepen? In the earlier cycle, XRP spent months completing its correction before launching into an explosive rally. The 2024 structure mirrors the past ABC pattern, while the ongoing 2025–2026 correction is aligning closely with the final C-wave down to the $1.87 region, though on a slightly shorter timeline. If this fractal continues to play out, Altcoin Pioneers believe XRP could be nearing the end of a painful shakeout phase, setting the stage for the next powerful upside leg. XRP has followed this script before, and those who held through the last cycle understand what’s coming next. Featured image from Peakpx, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Risks A Year-Long Bear Market If This Happens: On-Chain Data",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s price action has pushed a closely watched on-chain profitability gauge into a configuration that, in 2022, preceded an extended drawdown and one analyst says a break below $70,000 would risk repeating that “year-long” reset. In a Dec. 30 morning brief, Axel Adler Jr. argued that Bitcoin’s “Supply in Profit” trend is at an inflection point after BTC stabilized in the $87,000–$90,000 range following the pullback from October highs. The metric, which tracks how much BTC is held above its acquisition price, has fallen sharply from October peaks above 19 million BTC to roughly 13.2 million BTC, creating a sizable gap between short- and medium-term moving averages. A 2022-Like Setup Looms For Bitcoin Adler’s core signal is the spread between the 30-day and 90-day simple moving averages of Supply in Profit. After the correction from the all-time high, the 30-day average “dropped significantly below” the 90-day, forming a gap of about 1.75 million BTC. Adler noted that “a similar configuration was observed in 2022 before an extended bearish period,” but stressed an important distinction this time: the 365-day moving average remains “at historically elevated levels for now,” implying the longer-term profit structure hasn’t fully rolled over. Related Reading: US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Key Catalyst For Potential Surge Toward $150,000 Next Year The near-term question is whether the 30-day trend has bottomed. Adler flagged Dec. 18 as a local minimum for the 30-day average and said it is now “beginning to turn around,” with confirmation tied to a simple condition: Supply in Profit must hold above its 30-day average, which in practice requires BTC to keep its footing at current levels or higher. Adler’s projection for a bullish recovery in this signal is unusually specific: he estimates the gap between the 30-day and 90-day averages is narrowing at roughly 28,000 BTC per day, mainly because the 90-day average is being pulled down mechanically as high October values roll out of the window. “Why is SMA 90 falling while price remains stable?” Adler wrote in the brief’s FAQ. “This is a mechanical effect of the moving average: values from early October are now dropping out of the 90-day window, when Supply in Profit was at peaks of 18–20M BTC with price at $115–125K. Even with stable current Supply, this pulls the average down.” Related Reading: 2026 Bitcoin Price Predictions: What Banks, Institutions And Experts Forecast That rollover effect, Adler said, should persist through late January, providing a “tailwind” that could allow the 30-day line to reclaim the 90-day line even without a dramatic surge in Supply in Profit. If the current rates of change hold, Adler projects a bullish cross — where the 30-day average rises above the 90-day — in late February to early March. The Invalidation: $70,000 The forecast, however, is explicitly price-sensitive. Adler estimated Supply in Profit has “elasticity to price” of 1.3x, meaning a 10% BTC drawdown could translate into about a 13% drop in the supply held in profit. In his model, the market’s critical fault line is the $70,000 zone. “At what price does the cross scenario get invalidated?” Adler wrote. “The critical zone is below $70K. At that level, Supply would fall to ~10M BTC, and SMA 30 would begin declining faster than SMA 90. The GAP would stop narrowing and shift to expansion, postponing the bullish signal indefinitely.” In that scenario, Adler said the setup would more closely mirror 2022: the spread expands rather than compresses, and the bullish cross gets pushed out, with recovery potentially taking “up to one year.” By contrast, he framed the constructive path as holding above $75,000–$80,000 through January, keeping Supply in Profit supported and preserving the convergence pace. At press time, BTC traded at $88,102. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Crypto Hacks Swipe Nearly $3 Billion In 2025 Despite Fewer Attacks – Report",
    "body": "As we approach the final day of a massive year for the crypto industry, a recent report revealed that the sector has lost nearly $3 billion amid the emergence of new trends from malicious actors and growing security complexities. Related Reading: Solana Bearish Formation Hints At Major Correction Until Mid-2026 – Here’s The Target 2025 Crypto Losses Increase By 45% On Tuesday, blockchain security firm SlowMist shared its 2025 Blockchain Security & AML Annual Report, highlighting the severe security challenges the crypto industry faced throughout the year. According to SlowMist, the total value stolen from crypto hacks increased by 46% in 2025 compared to 2024, a trend previously noticed by earlier reports. Notably, crypto theft had been more devastating by the first half of this year than the entirety of 2024. A Mid-Year report by Chainalysis showed that 2025’s activity by the end of June revealed a significantly steeper trajectory into the end of the first half than any previous year, with an alarming velocity and consistency. Now that the year is near its end, security incidents have cost approximately $2.935 billion, according to SlowMist data, significantly surpassing the $2.013 billion in losses from the previous year. However, the number of incidents dropped year-over-year (YoY) despite the total amount of losses increasing, signaling a trend of fewer but larger-scale crypto heists. The number of incidents declined by 51%, with 200 cases in 2025. In comparison, 2024 saw 410 reported hacks. The report shared that DeFi remained the most frequently targeted sector this year, with 126 security incidents, accounting for approximately 63% of all hacks and total losses of around $649 million. This represents a 37% and 62% YoY decrease from 2024’s 339 incidents and $1.029 billion in losses, respectively. Meanwhile, Centralized exchange (CEX) platforms reported 22 incidents, which accounted for $1.809 billion in losses, led by Bybit’s hack. The February attack resulted in approximately $1.46 billion being stolen in a single incident, becoming the most serious and largest security event of the year. Regulatory Enforcement Strengthens Although phishing remained one of the most active schemes, scams and intrusive attacks continued to evolve in 2025, noted SlowMist. Therefore, scams have become more deceptive and difficult to detect, with malicious actors no longer relying on a single method of attack to deceive victims: Traditional phishing has gradually expanded into permission hijacking, malicious code execution, and supply-chain poisoning. Attacks are no longer reliant on a single method; instead, they increasingly combine social engineering, browser exploitation, new protocol mechanics, and hybrid lure strategies to form stealthy and destructive attack chains. However, the report highlighted that crypto enforcement and sanction actions worldwide displayed a “clear trend of escalation” this year, as regulatory and law enforcement agencies directly intervened “in key areas of crypto-related money laundering, fraud, sanctions evasion, and illicit financing.” Related Reading: Crypto’s Big Money Signals Change: BTC Holders Pause, ETH Whales Buy Notably, there were 18 incidents this year in which lost funds were recovered or frozen. In these cases, the total stolen funds totaled to $1.95 billion, of which nearly $387 million was successfully returned or frozen. SlowMist concluded that “the development of the Web3 industry will no longer rely solely on technical innovation. (…) Organizations that can build stronger internal security controls, more transparent fund governance models, and more comprehensive KYT/AML review capabilities will gain longer-term resilience in the next cycle.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Coinbase Premium At Rare Discount As US Demand Weakens",
    "body": "The Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has witnessed a sharp decline into the negative zone recently, with its value now sitting at one of the lowest in the last 18 months. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Plunged In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap. This indicator keeps track of the difference between the BTCUSD price on Coinbase and BTCUSDT price on Binance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Optimism Returns To End 2025—What Usually Follows? Coinbase is mainly used by traders in the US, especially the large institutional entities, while Binance hosts a global traffic. As such, the Coinbase Premium Gap reflects the difference in behavior between American and offshore whales. When the value of the metric is greater than zero, it means the asset is trading at a higher value on Coinbase than Binance. Such a trend implies users of the former are applying a higher amount of buying pressure (or lower amount of selling pressure) as compared to the userbase of the latter. On the other hand, the indicator being negative suggests Binance may be observing a higher amount of accumulation as the cryptocurrency is going for a higher price on the platform. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the last year and a half: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has fallen into the negative territory recently, implying the American investors have shifted their behavior to one of higher selling pressure/lower buying pressure. In other words, demand from US traders has gone down. Currently, the indicator is sitting at a value of -$122, which means the cryptocurrency’s price is trading at a discount of $122 on Coinbase relative to Binance. The last time that the metric fell to such a low level was during the price crash in November. In recent times, US institutional entities have played an impactful role in the market, so the Coinbase Premium Gap, which acts a proxy of their behavior, has tended to have some correlation with the asset’s spot price. This pattern was once again seen in November, when a drawdown occurred in the cryptocurrency alongside a plunge into the red zone for the metric. So far, Bitcoin has managed to be relatively stable even with the low demand from the American whales, but it only remains to be seen how long that will continue, given the scale of the discount on Coinbase.

    "title": "Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Dump Is Over: On-Chain Data Just Flipped",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s long-term holder cohort appears to have stopped net selling, according to multiple on-chain commentators, in a shift that could remove a key source of structural supply pressure heading into 2026. The change hinges on a supply-change read of long-term holders (coins held longer than six months), which had been negative for months but has now turned modestly positive, said on-chain analyst Darkfost. Is This The Bitcoin Bottom Signal? Darkfost argues that recent claims about long-term holders “selling more than ever” miss what the data is actually showing, especially when large, discrete exchange-related movements skew the picture. “On this chart, which I adjusted to isolate the movement of nearly 800,000 BTC from Coinbase that was distorting LTH data, we can observe a clear shift in supply change,” Darkfost wrote. “Since July 16, the monthly LTH supply change (30 day sum) had been firmly anchored in a distribution phase until recently.” Related Reading: 2026 Bitcoin Price Predictions: What Banks, Institutions And Experts Forecast In plain terms, that meant the share of supply held by long-term holders had been declining for much of the second half of 2025, a regime that tends to coincide with persistent sell pressure as older coins rotate into the market. That phase, Darkfost said, has now ended, at least for the moment. “We have now moved back into positive territory, with around 10,700 BTC transitioning into long term held coins,” Darkfost wrote, calling it “a very modest change,” but “not insignificant.” The implication is that long-term holders have eased off distribution enough for their aggregate holdings to start rising again, even as short-term holders “continue to hold their BTC,” in Darkfost’s framing. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju echoed the directional takeaway in a shorter post, saying, “Bitcoin long-term holders stopped selling.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks A Year-Long Bear Market If This Happens: On-Chain Data VanEck’s head of digital research Matthew Sigel characterized the turn as a meaningful shift in positioning pressure via X. “BTC: Long-term holders turn net accumulators, easing a major Bitcoin headwind and ending, for now, the largest sell pressure event from this cohort since 2019,” Sigel wrote. Renowned expert James Van Straten added historical context to the scale of the move, saying the magnitude of distribution “marked the 2019 bottom as well,” suggesting the current inflection is notable even if it doesn’t, by itself, guarantee a repeat. Darkfost also pointed to historical patterning around these flips. “Historically, such shifts have often preceded the formation of consolidation phases or even bullish recoveries, depending on how the broader trend evolves,” he wrote, emphasizing conditions rather than certainty.

    "body": "Charles Hoskinson isn’t backing away from big predictions. The Cardano founder says crypto is still early, despite years of growth and repeated boom-and-bust cycles. In his view, the industry is setting up for something much larger—both in size and in reach. Related Reading: Crypto Heat Fizzling Out? US Search Interest Plunges As Retail Shy Away Today, crypto counts more than 500 million users worldwide. The combined market value already sits in the trillions, with Bitcoin alone worth about $1.75 trillion. That’s impressive, but Hoskinson argues it’s nowhere near the finish line. He believes the sector can grow to 2 billion users and hit a $10 trillion total valuation. That’s a fourfold jump in adoption and more than triple today’s market size. His timeline is clear too. Hoskinson says this could happen within the next 10 years, by 2035. Why Hoskinson Thinks Crypto Explodes From Here The key driver, according to Hoskinson, is real-world asset tokenization, often called RWA. It’s the idea of putting traditional assets—like bonds, property, and commodities—onto blockchains. This isn’t theoretical anymore. Data from RWA.xyz shows close to $20 billion worth of assets, including bonds and real estate, have already been tokenized. That number keeps climbing, even during slow market periods. UPDATE: #Cardano $ADA Founder Charles Hoskinson says the crypto industry will “grow to 2 billion users over the next 10 years and a $10 trillion market cap, because of the RWA revolution and the unification of the financial markets.” $NIGHT pic.twitter.com/F9mntPZd0I — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) December 28, 2025 Hoskinson says this trend changes everything. When assets move on-chain, crypto stops being just about trading tokens. It becomes financial infrastructure. Add in global payment rails and shared standards across blockchains, and you get what he calls a “unified financial market.” Privacy-focused projects also matter here. Hoskinson has pointed to initiatives like Midnight, which aim to balance compliance and privacy. He believes these tools could make institutions more comfortable bringing large pools of capital on-chain. Cardano’s Reality Check In The Market Still, Hoskinson’s optimism comes at an awkward time for his own network. Cardano (ADA) is ending the year under pressure. Selling has stayed heavy, and rallies haven’t lasted. Buying volume remains thin. Price action is stuck below key resistance levels, and momentum hasn’t flipped. As a result, ADA is hovering near important support zones. If those levels break, traders warn the token could drop below $0.30, a psychological line many are watching closely. Market activity overall has slowed, and for now, sellers are still in control. This disconnect hasn’t gone unnoticed. Critics argue Hoskinson’s push for cooperation is partly driven by Cardano’s struggle to attract users at the pace seen on other major chains. Abundance Of Wealth Hoskinson rejects the idea that crypto is a winner-takes-all game. He says the future isn’t about one chain dominating the rest. Instead, he sees room for many networks to grow together. Related Reading: Crypto Policy In The Hot Seat As US Lawmaker Calls SEC Hearing There’s lots of wealth to spread around, he’s said recently. In his view, projects with real use cases will find users naturally as the market expands. That thinking explains his openness to partnerships. Hoskinson has previously hinted at collaborations involving major ecosystems like XRP and Solana. The goal, he says, is shared growth, not tribal fights. Whether the industry reaches $10 trillion remains an open question. But here’s the thing: If RWAs keep moving on-chain and global finance truly starts to merge with crypto rails, the market Hoskinson imagines won’t sound so far-fetched anymore.

    "title": "Dogecoin Near $0.11–$0.12 Offers ‘Incredible Risk/Reward,’ Says Analyst",
    "body": "Crypto analyst Matt Hughes, who posts as “The Great Mattsby,” called the $0.11–$0.12 zone “incredible” risk/reward for Dogecoin in a Dec. 30 X post, sharing a weekly DOGE/USDT chart to argue the support is clearly defined. Another trader pushed back, saying traders may be “better off picking a good chart,” setting up a quick dispute over whether DOGE is a high-quality setup or just a cheap one. The Best Risk/Reward Zone For Dogecoin Hughes’ chart frames the $0.11–$0.12 area as a multi-year “line in the sand” on a weekly timeframe. On the right axis, DOGE is marked around $0.1236, sitting just above an orange horizontal band drawn slightly over $0.10. That horizontal is the zone Hughes is referring to, and it’s positioned where price has repeatedly based before, most notably during the long 2022–2023 trough, making it an obvious level for traders who want a nearby invalidation point. He also overlays a linear-scale Gann Square with several rising diagonal guides. The most relevant one is a green, upward-sloping support line that runs under price from the early history of the chart into 2026; the current pullback is compressing into that rising support at roughly the same time it meets the $0.11–$0.12 horizontal. In practical terms, the setup Hughes is advertising is confluence: a horizontal demand zone meeting a long-term uptrend line, which can offer a relatively tight “risk” reference if the level fails. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Mirrors Silver’s Breakout, Analyst Flags $9+ Scenario “Risk/reward in the .11-.12 zone for $DOGE is incredible here,” Hughes wrote. “You can visualize support perfectly with this linear scale Gann Square below.” Above spot, the next clearly marked band is a light-blue horizontal line around $0.23, which aligns with a region DOGE has churned around during prior rebounds. Higher up, Hughes’ chart marks additional overhead levels around $0.35 (green) and roughly $0.46 (teal), with a thick line near the upper end of the range around $0.58–$0.60. If the $0.11–$0.12 zone holds, the chart implies the market has room to work back into those overhead shelves; if it doesn’t, the next visible guideposts on the chart are lower rising diagonals in the $0.05–$0.07 region, which would represent a materially deeper reset on the same multi-year structure. On the macro backdrop, Hughes is clear: ” Crypto in 2026: The Bull Run That’ll Crush Fiat Dreams! While governments print money like it’s confetti and banks hoard your wealth, #Bitcoin hits $500K, #Ethereum flips entire industries, Solana owns speed, $XRP settles global finance overnight, and $DOGE moons harder than ever because the memes became money. Skeptics? You’re the same ones who called it a scam in 2021 because you bought the top. Time to wake up or get left in the dust.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Repeating Its 2020 Accumulation Cycle, Analyst Says Renowned trader Cheds Trading (@BigCheds) challenged the trade premise bluntly: “Prob better off picking a good chart than throwing money at a bad one.” Hughes didn’t reject the critique; he acknowledged momentum can be easier elsewhere, but restated his preference for a defined downside at the levels he highlighted: “Yea you can ride the momentum better that way but I like the risk/reward in this zone for DOGE.” Hughes’ post also landed alongside broader rotation chatter. He cited @MerlijnTrader approvingly in a separate message, echoing a sentiment-led thesis that altcoin turns often begin when positioning is defensive and conviction is thin. “Look at the wall street cheat sheet, man. We are in depression, right? Trot maps, emotion to price and it’s screaming maximum opportunity right now,” Merlijn said in a short video. “Just got to pick the right coins.” Merlijn tied any rotation to bitcoin’s next resolution and emphasized how uncomfortable those early turns tend to feel. “Once Bitcoin resolves now, all stone bottom one, Bitcoin is weak, right? So they bought them on Bitcoin and stable and everyone has emotionally given up on everything else,” he said. “That’s how rotations are born really quietly, uncomfortably before conviction returns.” For Dogecoin, Hughes’ chart reduces that broader debate to a single question: does the $0.11–$0.12 confluence area hold on the weekly, or does the market force traders to reassess risk further down the structure. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1232. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Sees 80% Spike In Major Metric, Why This Matters For Price Appreciation",
    "body": "XRP has recorded a notable surge in one of its most closely watched derivative indicators, which brings attention to how traders are positioning around the asset. Data shows that open interest tied to XRP derivatives jumped by about 80% within a very short four-hour window in the recent trading day, pointing to a sudden influx of leveraged activity. Moves of this magnitude rarely happen in isolation and often point to growing tension beneath the surface of price action, especially when they occur without a clean breakout on the chart. A Four-Hour Reversal After Days Of Weak Participation The spike in open interest shows a rapid increase in the number of outstanding XRP futures and perpetual contracts. When open interest rises this quickly, it usually means traders are aggressively opening new positions, often using leverage. Related Reading: XRP Stochastic RSI Just Touched 0.0 For The Second Time In History The speed of the move is what separates this spike from routine fluctuations. Prior to the surge, XRP open interest had been trending lower, showing reduced trader engagement and a cooling derivatives environment. However, this change was quickly reversed when open interest increased by over 80% in just a four-hour timeframe, culminating in the total number of outstanding contracts standing around 1.74 billion XRP at the time of writing. In terms of price, this translates to about $3.26 billion in exposure being held open across XRP futures markets, according to data from CoinGlass. Why This Setup Matters For XRP Price Appreciation XRP’s price action has been slow in recent days, with the cryptocurrency currently trading at $1.87. Price action has started to respond positively in the short term, though only modestly so far. XRP is up about 0.3% over the past 24 hours, a move that looks small on the surface. Related Reading: Can XRP Price Reach $10,000? Expert Says It’s Different Math, Different League However, when open interest expands this quickly and price begins to edge higher at the same time, it means that traders are leaning bullish and testing the upside, even if spot buyers have not yet committed in size. The lack of a strong breakout at this stage shows that the market is still probing for direction, but the balance has begun to tilt away from complete stagnation. The broader price action adds more context after zooming out slightly. XRP has gained roughly 0.8% over the past seven days, indicating a slow grind higher rather than a sudden impulse move. If price continues to inch higher and manages to clear nearby resistance levels, the elevated open interest could amplify upside moves as short sellers are forced to exit. On the other hand, if XRP’s price action stalls or falls back despite the recent 0.3% daily and 0.8% weekly gains, then the growing leverage on one side increases the risk of a bigger pullback. In that sense, even these small percentage gains matter. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Standard Chartered Analysts Predict 330% XRP Price Surge After This Happens",
    "body": "Standard Chartered analysts have predicted that the XRP price could surge by around 330%. They also outlined catalysts that could spark this price surge, which would lead to a new all-time high (ATH) for the Ripple-linked token. Standard Chartered Predicts XRP Price Surge To $8 Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoff Hendrick, has predicted that the XRP price could surge to $8 by the end of 2026, which represents an increase of around 330%. This would also mark a new all-time high for the token, with its current ATH at around $3.84. The analyst expects the token to record such growth, as it now has legal clarity following the settlement of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit. Related Reading: This Double Bottom Formation Could Send XRP Soaring To $2.5 Kendrick also expects the XRP price to surge to $8 on the back of regulatory clarity for the U.S. crypto industry and institutional adoption of the token through the XRP ETFs. The Standard Chartered analyst noted how the improving regulatory environment has made it easier for institutions to gain exposure to the token. Meanwhile, Ripple has been able to grow its payment system, which involves XRP, thanks to the regulatory-friendly environment. These XRP ETFs are notably seeing significant demand, which is bullish for the XRP price as it eyes a rally to $8 next year. SoSoValue data shows that these ETFs have yet to record a daily net outflow since the first spot fund launched last month. The XRP ETFs currently boast a net asset of $1.27 billion, which reprersents 1.12% of the token’s market cap. Crypto pundit Unknow noted that these ETFs are absorbing the supply fast, which is why he predicts that a supply shock could happen by early 2026, sending the XRP price higher. The pundit also declared that next year is the inflection point where the altcoin shifts from speculation to global liquidity infrastructure. XRP Is Preparing For a Breakout In an X post, crypto analyst TARA stated that the XRP price is approaching the critical $1.88 level and is in a very tight range, signaling a breakout is coming soon. The analyst noted that XRP needs to hold support at $1.87, even as Bitcoin approaches $88,000. She added that if the altcoin bounces from here and tests $1.88 again, it could break above that resistance and then hold it as support, which TARA noted would be a very bullish sign. In another X post, she revealed that XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was trying to break to the upside. TARA further remarked that if today’s close is bullish, with a close above $1.88, it could fuel the next wave to $2.30 for the XRP price. A positive for XRP is that Glassnode data shows that XRP on exchanges has dropped to a seven-year low of 1.6 billion tokens, down from 3.76 billion in October.
