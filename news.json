    "title": "Ethereum Founder Breaks Silence With Major Upgrade Proposal",
    "body": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has unveiled a major proposal that could fundamentally reshape how the network handles transaction fees. His new design aims to replace unpredictable costs with a system that lets users plan and budget more effectively, signaling one of the most significant shifts in Ethereum’s economic framework in years. Ethereum Gas Fees As Predictable, Prepaid Resources Buterin’s proposal centers on a new on-chain gas futures market. Today, gas fees rise and fall based on network congestion and users have no way to know in advance what they will pay, which complicates planning for developers, businesses, and high-volume platforms. Related Reading: XRP Price Is Performing As Expected; Analyst Reveals What Comes Next The new model reshapes that dynamic by allowing users to purchase a defined amount of gas at a fixed price for future use. Rather than hoping the network will be affordable at the moment they need to transact, they can lock in their costs in advance. This moves Ethereum from a system dominated by short-term fee volatility to one anchored in stable, forward-looking pricing Under the proposed design, these futures contracts would be traded directly on-chain. Their prices would naturally reflect expectations of future demand. When demand is expected to increase, futures prices rise; when expected to fall, they drop. This creates a transparent, market-driven view of upcoming network activity, giving developers and organizations a more reliable basis for planning their operations. The structure also builds on the foundation set by EIP-1559, which introduced the base fee mechanism. Buterin’s futures market doesn’t replace that system—it extends it. It transforms gas from reactive cost into a resource that can be managed in advance, similar to how businesses lock in costs for electricity, bandwidth, or other essential inputs. Operational Benefits For Developers, Businesses, And The Network The most immediate benefit is cost certainty. High-volume users—exchanges, rollups, wallets, and automation services—often operate on tight margins, and sudden gas fee spikes disrupt operations and planning. By locking in future gas costs, this uncertainty is removed, supporting consistent service delivery. Developers also gain a stable environment, enabling them to schedule upgrades, plan deployments, and manage workloads without worrying about fee surges. This predictability strengthens project roadmaps and enhances user experience. Related Reading: Are Dogecoin Whales Leaving The Meme Coin? Large Transactions Crash To 2-Month Lows For enterprises integrating Ethereum into payments, verification, or data-processing workflows, predictable fees are essential. Buterin’s model addresses this barrier, positioning Ethereum as a more reliable foundation for long-term, large-scale adoption. At the network level, the futures market introduces clearer economic signals. Rising futures prices indicate increasing demand for blockspace, guiding scaling decisions and resource allocation. Falling prices signal lower demand, enabling more efficient development and infrastructure planning. The proposal does not lower gas fees but makes them manageable, converting an unstable cost into a predictable one. This enhances Ethereum’s appeal for serious applications, institutional activity, and reliable operational planning. By introducing a gas futures mechanism, the ecosystem can better manage costs and prepare for growth, marking a decisive step toward a more professional-grade Ethereum.

    "body": "XRP’s price has continued to chop, trading sideways, which has impacted the price of the U.S. spot ETFs that provide exposure to the altcoin. Canary Capital’s XRP fund has crashed 20% since its launch, although this fund remains the largest by assets under management (AuM). XRP’s Sideways Price Action Leads To Spot ETF Crash The XRP price has continued to trade within a tight range, just above the psychological $2 level, sparking bearish sentiment among investors. The altcoin is down over 10% in the last month, around the time the first spot XRP ETF, Canary’s fund, launched. This bearish price action has notably contributed to a price crash for Canary’s XRPC fund. Related Reading: XRP ETFs Are About To Hit $1 Billion – Here’s How Much Is Flowing In Daily TradingView data shows that Canary’s XRP ETF is down 20% since its launch on November 13. XRPC also dropped almost 10% last week amid choppy price action. Canary’s fund has also likely crashed due to increased competition from three other spot funds that launched after it. This has led to a slowdown in its inflows since these funds launched. Meanwhile, these funds track the spot XRP price, which also explains Canary’s XRPC crash. XRP has mirrored Bitcoin’s price action amid concerns that the crypto market may already be in a bear market. XRP whales also look to be bearish at the moment, as Santiment data shows a drop in whale transactions from a recent high recorded in November. However, despite this bearish sentiment, with the crypto market currently in a state of fear, the XRP ETFs have continued to record daily net inflows. SoSo Value data show that these funds have been on a 16-day net inflow streak since Canary’s XRP fund launched on November 13, and they have yet to record a net outflow day. Canary’s XRP ETF, which has suffered a 20% price crash, is currently the largest spot XRP fund with $364 million in assets under management. Grayscale’s GXRP is second with $211 million, while Bitwise and Franklin Templeton are third and fourth. As a group, these XRP funds are about to hit $1 billion in assets under management, with $861 million in total net assets. Some Positives For The Altcoin Santiment data show that XRP exchange outflows have outweighed inflows in recent times. This is a positive as it indicates that more investors are accumulating than selling. Exchange outflows typically represent moves for long-term holding, especially in anticipation of higher prices. Related Reading: Pundit Predicts That XRP Is About To Make Investors Extremely Rich In an X post, Santiment mentioned that the XRP Ledger is seeing a fascinating trend of whale and shark wallets shrinking in number but continuing to grow in coins held. The on-chain analytics platform noted that there are 20.6% fewer 100 million XRP wallets, but that these wallets, as a group, still own a 7-year high 48 billion coins. As such, the existing 100 million XRP wallets are doubling down on their accumulation efforts and making up for the shrinking number of wallets. At the time of writing, the altcoin’s price is trading at around $2.07, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Poised For Lift-Off As Key Bullish Catalysts Kick In: Ex-CEO",
    "body": "According to former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, battles over the US debt ceiling create clear cash swings that move markets. When the Treasury spends down its main checking account — the Treasury General Account, or TGA — new dollars enter the system and lift risky assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Is Just Getting Started — 200x Growth Possible, Tom Lee Says Later, when the Treasury refills the TGA by selling debt, cash is pulled back out and pressure returns to stocks and crypto, he said. Hayes points to 2023 as a clear example, when a large pool of funds at the Fed’s reverse repo facility — about $2.5 trillion — was available to be drawn back into markets. Market Metrics And Recent Moves Traders can see the effects in price action. Bitcoin’s recent fall toward the $80,000 area followed a stretch of tighter liquidity, and the rebound to above $91,000 has many investors asking whether the sell-off marked a cycle low. The crypto market gained ground Monday, with total capitalization rising to a little over $3 trillion, up 1.2% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin climbed to $92,120, a 1.50% increase on the day and almost 6.5% higher over the week. Ethereum traded around $3,160 after a 4% daily rise and an 11% weekly jump. Reports have disclosed that these moves come as traders watch big-dollar flows tied to US Treasury operations and central bank balance sheet moves. Smaller gains in the last day sit against larger weekly returns for several top tokens, showing that swings remain wide but that buying interest has reappeared. Why 2025 Looks Different Based on reports, Hayes says 2025 is not the same as 2023. The reverse repo balances that helped fuel the earlier rally are largely gone, and liquidity tightened by almost $1 trillion between July and late 2025 as the Treasury issued debt and the Fed ran quantitative tightening. That drought of available cash was a headwind for risk assets and helped push prices lower. The mechanics are simple: less cash chasing assets tends to reduce bids and widen price drops. Price Reaction And Cross-Market Effects The liquidity story is not limited to crypto. Stocks, gold, and property responded to the same flow shifts during the prior cycle. Hayes estimates that about $2.5 trillion of liquidity was effectively redeployed from Fed facilities into markets in 2023, amplifying gains across asset classes. When that source was absent in 2025, selling pressure intensified and volatility rose. Related Reading: Massive Bitcoin Awakening: 2 Physical Coins Unlock $179 Million After 13 Years Favorable Market Conditions Hayes says the environment has shifted in a positive way. The Fed has put quantitative tightening on hold, liquidity pressure in the Treasury market is calming down, the TGA is close to where officials want it, and banks are starting to open up their lending taps again. He views the slide toward $80,000 as the cycle low and expects upward pressure as cash conditions improve. According to his view, these factors together create the environment for renewed upside.

    "title": "Bitcoin To Hit $50 Million By 2041, Says EMJ Capital CEO",
    "body": "EMJ Capital CEO Eric Jackson has laid out one of the most aggressive long-term bitcoin targets in the space yet, arguing in an interview with reporter Phil Rosen that the cryptocurrency could reach $50 million per coin by 2041. His projection is tied to a thesis that bitcoin will evolve from “digital gold” into the core collateral layer of the global financial system. Jackson said his thinking grows out of the same “hundred bagger” framework he used when buying beaten-down equities like Carvana. He recalled entering Carvana after its share price collapsed from around $400 to roughly $3.50 in 2022, at a time when sentiment was almost universally hostile. “You would hear things like, that’s run by a bunch of criminals. This is what a bunch of idiots. Like you’d have to be an idiot to let your company go from $400 this year to $450 or $350 rather,” he told Rosen.

For Jackson, that period illustrated how markets behave at extremes. “It’s human nature almost that when you’re in the moment of max pain or pessimism, you can only see what’s right in front of you,” he said. Yet the underlying product remained strong: “It wasn’t a broken platform. It wasn’t a broken service they would tell you they loved it. It was so easy. It was the best customer experience they had.” From there, he could “envision how they were going to be like a much more profitable business” once the company focused on profitability and addressed its debt. Jackson’s Long-Term Thesis For Bitcoin He applies the same long-horizon lens to bitcoin, arguing that the day-to-day ticker and polarized narratives obscure its structural potential. “We get so tied to turning on the TV and just seeing, like, what’s the price of Bitcoin today […] Some people are bearish and they say, oh, it’s a Ponzi scheme. And some people are bullish and they just, you know, throw these like kind of pie in the sky targets that you can’t really tie to reality,” Jackson said. “It’s kind of hard to latch on to like, what is the value of this thing?” Jackson begins with the common “digital gold” framing. He asks how large the gold market is, how many central banks and sovereigns hold it and why. “Could Bitcoin be as big as gold one day? That seems like a safe assumption,” he argued, adding that because it is “digital” and “programmable” rather than a “hunk of rock,” younger generations may prefer it as a store of value. But he stresses that this is only part of the story, as bitcoin has not become a medium for daily transactions “since the guy who bought pizza with Bitcoin back in like 2011.” The “penny dropped,” he said, when he began to think in terms of what he calls the “global collateral layer” that underpins borrowing by sovereigns and central banks. Historically, that base layer moved from gold to the Eurodollar system from the 1960s onward, and today is heavily intertwined with sovereign debt. “All the countries around the world issue debt and then they kind of borrow against that and they do their daily like government transactions,” he noted, but “there are problems with that.” Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Top Analyst Assigns 91.5% Probability In Jackson’s “Vision 2041,” bitcoin replaces the Eurodollar and, functionally, becomes the neutral asset that other balance sheets are built upon. He argues that bitcoin is “much superior” as collateral because it is digital and “apolitical,” sitting outside central banks and the influence of “whoever the latest treasury secretary here is in the US.” As with the Eurodollar, he does not see this as a direct attack on the dollar or Treasuries, but as a new underlying layer: “There’s some underlying thing that a lot of other countries and the financial systems borrow against to kind of do things.” Eric Jackson (@ericjackson) expects bitcoin to hit $50 million by 2041. He compares his thesis to how he knew Carvana, $CVNA, would be a 100-bagger stock pick. pic.twitter.com/CA9BWoR4zF — Phil Rosen (@philrosenn) December 7, 2025 Looking ahead 15 years, Jackson envisions sovereigns that currently issue and roll debt instead “rely on Bitcoin,” because “over time, like that’s much more logical.” Given the “enormous” scale of the sovereign debt world, he argues that if bitcoin becomes the dominant collateral substrate, its price per coin would need to reach orders of magnitude above current levels—hence his $50 million-by-2041 target. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,574. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,000 and $3,020 levels. The price is trading above $3,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,140 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above the $3,150 zone. Ethereum Price Eyes Additional Gains Ethereum price managed to stay above $2,920 and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin . ETH price gained strength for a move above the $3,000 and $3,020 resistance levels. Recently, the price saw a downside correction from the $3,240 zone. There was a drop below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,718 swing low to the $3,240 low. However, the bulls remained active near the $2,920 zone. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is another upward move, the price could face resistance near the $3,140 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,140 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next key resistance is near the $3,200 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,250 level. A clear move above the $3,250 resistance might send the price toward the $3,320 resistance. An upside break above the $3,320 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,450 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. Another Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,140 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,050 level. The first major support sits near the $3,000 zone. A clear move below the $3,000 support might push the price toward the $2,950 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,920 region and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,718 swing low to the $3,240 low. The next key support sits at $2,840 and $2,820. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.

    "title": "All-In On XRP: Why This Leading Investor Sold His Entire Bitcoin Stack",
    "body": "According to reports, a well-known crypto commentator/investor who goes by the handle Crypto X AiMan has sold all his Bitcoin and moved the proceeds into XRP. He says four reasons drove his decision, and the move has stirred debate across trading circles. Related Reading: Massive Bitcoin Awakening: 2 Physical Coins Unlock $179 Million After 13 Years Investor Dumps Bitcoin For XRP AiMan, who says he first bought Bitcoin when it traded at $3,000, told followers that legal clarity is the main reason for his shift. He pointed to a July 2023 court ruling by Judge Torres that found certain programmatic XRP sales were not securities. According to him, that court decision gives XRP a different standing from many other tokens. He also noted that US regulators often treat Bitcoin as a commodity, a stance reiterated by former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. AiMan framed the court outcome as a rare, explicit legal test that favored XRP. He highlighted another factor: Ripple’s large holdings. Based on company disclosures, Ripple holds close to 40 billion XRP, nearly 40% of the total supply. AiMan argued those reserves could support future use cases if Ripple or its partners chose to deploy the tokens for payments. I just sold ALL my Bitcoin. Yes, you read that right. I went 100% all-in on XRP. Here’s why: XRP is the only crypto with legal clarity in the United States (won the SEC case, not a security). Ripple owns ~40B XRP and is partnered with 300+ banks, central banks, and payment… pic.twitter.com/tRzpiKPas5 — Crypto X AiMan (@CryptoXAiMan) December 5, 2025 He called XRP faster and cheaper to move than Bitcoin, saying it is built for cross-border transfers — a point he used to contrast XRP’s utility with Bitcoin’s role as a store of value. He also ran through a market-size scenario. Market analysts have projected the cross-border payments market at $250 trillion by 2027, and AiMan suggested that even a 1% share of that volume could mean big gains for XRP. He admitted the trade is extreme: “If I’m wrong? XRP probably goes to zero, and I lose everything,” he said. He added that if he is right, the payoff would be huge. XRP’s Legal Advantage Market reaction has been mixed. Based on reports from data providers, traders are taking large short positions against XRP. Coinglass figures show XRP with $15 million in shorts versus $0.6 million in longs — a roughly 96% short allocation and a shorts-to-longs ratio near 25 to 1. For comparison, Bitcoin had $131 million in shorts and $70 million in longs; Ethereum showed $110 million shorts and $58 million longs. Despite heavy shorting, XRP has posted daily gains at times, according to recent price movements. Aggressive Shorts Dominate Positioning Analysts say heavy short positions can indicate weak near-term sentiment. They also create technical risks, because a squeeze could push prices higher quickly if shorts are forced to cover. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Is Just Getting Started — 200x Growth Possible, Tom Lee Says That does not remove the core risks AiMan flagged and others raised: a big token allocation held by one company raises centralization concerns, and banks have not broadly shifted settlement rails to public tokens. Bitcoin still has a market cap near $1.8 trillion and deeper liquidity, which many investors view as stability in a volatile market. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "The Dogecoin price has been drifting through a subdued stretch over the past few days, holding around the mid-$0.13 to $0.14. The recent decline has slowed down in the past 48 hours, and the chart now shows the meme coin attempting to steady itself after weeks of persistent selling pressure. Trader Tardigrade, a well-known crypto analyst on X, shared a new three-day chart suggesting that an important MACD signal is on the verge of forming, and historical performance shows that Dogecoin tends to move bullish once this signal appears. Approaching The MACD Bullish Cross Dogecoin’s quiet phase in the past 48 hours has become increasingly important because one of Dogecoin’s higher-timeframe indicators is beginning to show early signs of life. According to Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin’s MACD indicator on the 3-day candlestick price chart has not yet confirmed a bullish cross, but it is very close to doing so. Related Reading: Trend Reversal Puts Dogecoin On A Path To $0.188 The chart he shared shows the MACD lines converging at the lower boundary of the recent downtrend, and the blue line is approaching the red line. The blue line is about to cross over the red one, mirroring the exact setup that preceded previous breakouts earlier this year. Even with Dogecoin trading quietly in recent days, the compression of the MACD indicator hints that bearish momentum is fading. Once the cross officially forms, the trend will shift into a bullish one. This gradual tightening of price movement is also characteristic of an accumulation phase, and this is shown by an important Dogecoin metric. Dogecoin Price Chart, MACD Cross. Source: @TATrader_Alan On X How High The Dogecoin Price Could Go The chart reveals a clear pattern: every time Dogecoin printed a three-day MACD bullish cross in 2025, the price responded with a significant upward move. The first cross was in April, and this preceded a rally that pushed Dogecoin’s price from below $0.14 into a breakout to $0.26. A second cross followed during mid-summer in July, and once again the price climbed aggressively shortly afterward. This saw the Dogecoin price rally from around $0.16 to $0.30 very briefly. Related Reading: The MicroStrategy Of Asia: Japanese Company Announces Plan For Bitcoin And XRP Treasury Both events are circled on the chart above, showing how the momentum flipped swiftly once the MACD crossed above the signal line. These repeated reactions strengthen the case that Dogecoin could be preparing for another sizeable run if the indicator confirms a cross in the coming days. The projection area drawn on the right side of the chart points to a climb that extends well above $0.20. This suggests that the next wave may revisit the upper levels where Dogecoin last traded during its late-summer rally. The analyst’s chart outlines a wide upward arc, indicating that the expected move would not be a minor rebound but a structured uptrend similar to the earlier surges this year. In terms of a price target, the projection shows Dogecoin reaching a price target around $0.35 in the next few weeks. This would translate to a 140% increase from Dogecoin’s current price of $0.142.
