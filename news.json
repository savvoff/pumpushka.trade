    "title": "Dogecoin Is A ‘Client-Statement Risk’ For Advisers, ETF Experts Say",
    "body": "Dogecoin’s attempt to join the institutional ETF lineup is running into a basic problem: institutions may not want it. In a Jan. 22 conversation on the Crypto Prime podcast, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart and host Nate Geraci who is also the President of NovaDius Wealth Management said spot Dogecoin ETFs have attracted “near zero” demand so far, an outcome they tied to who typically buys DOGE, and how financial advisers think about reputational risk inside client portfolios. The Dogecoin datapoint landed inside a broader discussion about a crowded crypto ETF pipeline. Seyffart said his running tally of crypto ETF filings has climbed “over 150 unquestionably,” with many products spanning spot and derivatives, income overlays, buffers, and multi-asset structures. The surge, he argued, looks like issuers “throw[ing] the spaghetti at the wall” in 2026. Dogecoin ETF Reality Check But volume of filings doesn’t guarantee demand, and Dogecoin is the clearest example offered of that gap thus far. Pressed on which existing products stood out, Seyffart said “nothing really stands out,” before singling out Dogecoin as the exception, precisely because it has not resonated. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flirts With An Inverse Head And Shoulders: $0.15 Break Is The Trigger “The real honest answer is like nothing really stands out to me honestly if I have to pick one thing that kind of stands out, it’s probably that the Doge ETFs have gotten almost no interest whatsoever,” he said. He added that while some newer altcoin products have done “decently well,” Dogecoin has not. My conversation w/ @JSeyff on current state of crypto ETFs… We discuss: -Crypto ETF sentiment -150+ crypto-related ETF filings -Morgan Stanley crypto ETFs -BlackRock’s next move -Index & active crypto ETFs -Recent flows -What’s nexthttps://t.co/2TzJAnKXuK via @CryptoPrimePod pic.twitter.com/mtDuuDirB7 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) January 22, 2026 Seyffart and Geraci converged on a demand thesis: the marginal buyer of DOGE likely already has the tooling and habit set to buy it directly, rather than through an ETF wrapper. “I remember talking to the guys at Bitwise. I was like, I don’t think anyone’s going to buy this,” Seyffart said. “But maybe I’m wrong. I’ve been wrong plenty of times before. But I mean, literally no one has bought like the Doge ETFs […] I had pretty low expectations, but I thought maybe they could get to a point where they’re slightly profitable.” Seyffart pointed to Bitwise’s product—ticker BWOW—as an early scoreboard: “it’s under a million in assets right now,” he said, calling that “near zero demand.” He cautioned the funds are still new, noting the Bitwise product launched at the end of November, but framed the initial traction as “very minuscule.” Geraci’s explanation was blunter: ”The people who buy that, in general, these are degens and they already know how to access this. They already have digital wallets. They don’t need an ETF to access this […]. And I think that’s going to be a lot of these other coins that are much further down the market cap spectrum.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Foundation-Backed ETF Launches On Nasdaq As Analysts Call For Massive DOGE Rally Geraci argued Dogecoin faces an additional headwind that doesn’t show up in crypto-native narratives but matters in the ETF market: advisers. “The other aspect here […] is what I call client statement risk,” Geraci said. “So financial advisors, they’re the biggest driver of ETF flows. And so let’s take Dogecoin as an example […] If you’re a financial adviser and you have a Dogecoin ETF show up on a client statement […] it’s like a flashing red light saying, ‘Please fire me and go find another adviser.’” That framing matters because the episode repeatedly returned to distribution realities. Seyffart said he’s most excited about basket and index-style crypto ETFs, in part because advisers don’t want to “pick those winners and losers” across a growing long tail of assets. In Geraci’s view, a basket is the “easy button” for professional allocators who want crypto exposure without underwriting each token’s story or defending it to clients. Seyffart also suggested “what the actual chain is doing” can shape adviser appetite, contrasting niche infrastructure plays such as Chainlink, which he described as connecting DeFi and TradFi, against meme assets like DOGE, which he implied may be less “appetizing” for ETF buyers. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.12479. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Stablecoins May Soon Power Payments Made Entirely By AI—CEO",
    "body": "Circle’s chief executive painted a brisk picture at Davos this week: autonomous software agents that act for people could be using stablecoins to pay for everyday things within three to five years. He said these agents will need a money system that is stable, fast, and programmable. That, he argued, points to stablecoins as the likely choice. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sharp Reversal Leaves Over $800 Million Liquidated In 1 Day AI Agents And Money According to reports, Jeremy Allaire of Circle said “literally billions” of AI agents may be transacting on behalf of users in the near term. “Three years, five years from now, one can expect that there will be billions, literally billions of AI agents conducting economic activity in the world on a continuous basis,” Allaire said during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He described work on new networks and tools aimed at letting software act like small businesses or helpers that buy services, settle bills, and tip content creators. This idea is simple on the surface: software needs a reliable unit of account when it spends, and tokenized dollars can fit that role. Building The Tools Reports say companies across the crypto and tech world are racing to build the plumbing for this future. Circle is pitching USDC as a neutral payments layer that software can plug into. Other firms are testing protocols that let a machine sign off on a payment when certain conditions are met. Some large tech groups are also exploring ways for their platforms to let software pay for services automatically. Progress is visible, but the path is not yet clear. What Regulators Might Ask Regulators will have questions. Reports note concerns about money flow, consumer protections, and where bank deposits sit if stablecoins grow rapidly. At Davos, the CEO pushed back on the idea that stablecoins would drain bank deposits the way some fear, saying comparisons to other financial instruments are more fitting. Still, lawmakers in the US and elsewhere are watching closely. Rules could move faster if policy makers see real volume coming from so-called agentic commerce. New Networks, New Risks Based on reports, the technical choices will shape both convenience and danger. If agents can move value at scale, fraud and theft risks may rise too.

    "title": "Ethereum Funding Rates Pushing Towards Negative: What’s Going On?",
    "body": "Ethereum is currently trading under pressure after failing to push above the $3,000 level again over the past 24 hours, a move that is reflecting trader sentiment across the derivatives markets. ETH is currently trading at $2,925, down 2.7% on the day, after moving within a 24-hour range capped at $3,012.99 and finding lows around $2,909.60, according to price data from CoinGecko. As price action weakens, a notable change has been developing, with on-chain data showing funding rates drifting toward negative territory and derivative positioning beginning to tilt more defensively. Funding Rates Slide As Shorts Gain Ground Ethereum’s failure to hold above $3,000 is an important psychological break for traders, especially after several failed attempts to hold above that level in January. Price action over the past week shows sellers maintaining control after ETH rejected around $3,360 on January 18, followed by a steady push lower toward the high-$2,900s. Related Reading: The Ethereum MACD Crossover That Could Lead To A Massive Bull Wave Although the pullback has so far been orderly above $2,900, this decline has come alongside fading momentum across the derivatives market. One of the clearest signals for this can be seen in Ethereum’s OI-weighted funding rate, which has been steadily compressing and is now edging toward negative levels. At the time of writing, Ethereum’s OI-weighted is at 0.0008%, close to breaking into negative territory and far below readings around 0.009%, which it registered earlier in the month. Funding rates turning negative typically indicate that short positions are paying longs, meaning stronger demand for downside exposure. Funding spikes that previously accompanied the price rebound in early January have faded, and the overall trend suggests bearish positioning is slowly gaining the upper hand. Open Interest, Liquidations, And What’s Next Although Ethereum’s price action fell below $3,000, derivatives traders have stayed in the market, keeping total open interest at high levels. Data from CoinGlass shows aggregate Ethereum open interest increasing by 0.68% in the past 24 hours, which shows that many traders are not exiting Ethereum entirely. At the time of writing, the total open interest is sitting at about 13.36 million ETH, equivalent to roughly $39.19 billion. Related Reading: Ethereum’s 4-Hour Chart Says A Big Dump Is Coming, Here’s The Target Looking across major exchanges, Binance has the largest share of ETH open interest, accounting for about $8.95 billion, but it is down by 0.8% in the past 24 hours. CME follows with approximately $5.73 billion in open interest, up by 3.72% in the past 24 hours. Gate comes next at around $4.01 billion, while MEXC comes in close at $3.51 billion worth of ETH open interest. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum liquidations totaled $64.34 million, with long positions ($52.52 million) accounting for the majority of losses. A hold above $2,900 could allow Ethereum’s funding rates to normalize and open the door for another rebound attempt to $3,000. However, a continued fall in funding rates into negative territory could see bearish control pushing Ethereum below $2,900. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Ethereum Emerges As Likely Candidate In BlackRock Tokenization Vision – Here’s Why",
    "body": "Recent remarks from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink have pointed toward the need for a single, unified blockchain for tokenized markets, and have intensified the focus on platforms capable of handling institutional-scale liquidity, compliance, and settlement. With its long track record in smart contracts, extensive developer ecosystem, and growing role in regulated financial products, Ethereum is now emerging as the most likely candidate to serve as the settlement layer for tokenized capital markets. Why Asset Managers Prefer Familiar Infrastructure In an X post, the Ethereum Daily shared a video in which BlackRock CEO Larry Fink made it clear that tokenization is necessary. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, Fink said the financial system must move rapidly toward digitization, adding that a single, common blockchain could reduce corruption and improve transparency across the global markets. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Institutional Support, Though ETH Price Outlook Remains Contested While Fink did not name a specific network, the most plausible candidate could be ETH, based on BlackRock’s own initiatives and public statements that emphasized the role of ETH in asset tokenization. The firm has consistently highlighted ETH as a core platform for its on-chain strategy. Meanwhile, BlackRock launched its BUIDL tokenized money market fund directly on ETH, a product that has already grown to over $2 billion in total value locked. “There’s no second best,” Ethereum Daily noted. In the staking space, Bitmine has turned Ethereum staking into a multi-billion-dollar business. An analyst known as Milk Road has revealed that the company now has 1.83 million ETH staked, worth roughly $6 million at current prices, and plans to scale that figure toward 4.2 million ETH over time. Over the past months, Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. (BMNR) has accounted for nearly 50% of all new ETH entering the staking queue. Staking at this scale is important because it removes ETH from the liquid supply and locks it into long-term infrastructure rather than keeping it for short-term trading. When one player is willing to commit billions of dollars worth of ETH to staking, it reflects confidence in ETH’s future economic prospects. A lower liquid supply, combined with sustained network demand, will create structural pressure over time. How Support Built Through Multiple Market Cycles Analyst Milk Road has also highlighted that Ethereum is holding near a critical support zone around $3,000, hovering just above the lower boundary of its long-term rising structure, an area that has acted as a stress test for ETH throughout the cycle. Historically, when ETH drifts into this area, the market will need to decide whether the weakness is temporary or structural. Related Reading: Ethereum Maintains Structural Strength Despite Resistance Near $3,400 The $2,750 level remains the key line because it has repeatedly stopped downside pressure after macro-driven or narrative-driven pullbacks, making it a reliable floor for the broader trend. As long as ETH holds above that level, the broader multi-year uptrend will remain intact. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "XRP Price Recovery Is Possible If It Reclaims This Ichimoku Base",
    "body": "The XRP price may be preparing for a long-overdue recovery, as a crypto analyst has just highlighted a critical area that could flip the cryptocurrency’s downward momentum into a bullish one. According to the market expert, XRP must reclaim the Ichimoku Base before it can resume its upside to new levels. XRP Price Recovery To Resume Above Ichimoku Base Market analyst Xaif Crypto took to X this Thursday to deliver a fresh weekly update on XRP as the cryptocurrency enters a pivotal technical area after months of downside pressure. The accompanying chart shows price retreating from a prior peak in late 2024 and sliding back into a clearly marked demand zone in the blue box. Related Reading: What the Triple-Tap At $1.80 Means For The XRP Price According to the analyst, the recent retreat follows a clear downtrend, with lower highs pushing price back toward a previous consolidation zone. This blue-box area represents the main battleground, as prior trading activity built a base that could act as support if XRP revisits that level. So far, XRP appears to be stabilizing within this demand zone. Candles on the chart show hesitation and reduced selling pressure. The chart also draws attention to an Ichimoku structure, with XRP attempting to reclaim its Ichimoku Base. According to Xaif Crypto, this base will determine XRP’s next big move. The analyst has suggested that reclaiming this level could signal a potential shift in market sentiment. He disclosed that a strong close above it could favor upside continuation, weakening the ongoing downtrend and giving buyers more room to target upper resistance levels. Conversely, Xaif Crypto predicts that a break below the Ichimoku Base would likely lead to a deeper correction for XRP, as support would be lost and selling could accelerate. For now, XRP sits at a make-or-break level that could decide whether it recovers from its current slump. Xaif Crypto’s chart has outlined potential targets if the cryptocurrency manages to reclaim and hold above the Ichimoku Base. Currently hovering around $1.95, XRP faces potential bullish targets at $2.09, $2.20, $2.31, and $2.45. The analyst has also highlighted that traders and investors should closely watch the weekly close for confirmation of a sustained recovery. Analyst Says XRP Is Planning A Major Reversal Despite dropping below $2 earlier this week, analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s price outlook. According to market expert Crypto GVR, XRP could be attempting a major price reversal from the $1-$1.5 range. Based on his chart analysis, the analyst predicts that XRP could decline first from its current price around $1.95 to roughly $1.13 before rebounding sharply to new highs. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Surge Another 30% If This Trend Is Confirmed He has set a bullish target at $3.25. marking the next upside for XRP. If XRP were to crash to $1.13 and then surge to $3.25, this would represent a staggering 187% increase in value. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Litecoin Structure Intact, But $63 Remains The Line Bulls Must Defend",
    "body": "Litecoin is once again at a critical crossroads, with its long-term structure remaining intact after years of successful defenses. However, the margin for error is thin. As price hovers near key levels, $63 has emerged as the line bulls must protect. A break below it could shift momentum sharply, while holding above keeps the broader bullish structure alive and sets the stage for the next decisive move. Structure Gives Way, Expansion Phase Begins Columbus’s latest LTC update highlights that the multi-year compression that previously capped price action has finally resolved, resulting in a clean break of the long-term chart setup. This structural change confirms a shift from a neutral state to a clearly bullish one. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Litecoin Price May Be Getting Ready For Another Massive Rally The current price action is described as a pause before expansion rather than the conclusion of the rally. In this phase, Litecoin is holding steady above old resistance levels, allowing the market to load for the next leg of the move, turning previous barriers into new support. Litecoin’s projected path forward is based on the typical behavior of expansion cycles following structural breaks. The strategy follows a clear three-step progression: the initial breakout, followed by the current phase of acceptance. Once the market fully accepts these new price levels, the “real move” begins, representing a phase where the most significant gains are expected to materialize. The 9-Year Trendline That Still Controls Litecoin Matthew Dixon highlighted the immense historical significance of the Litecoin long-term trend line. This line has acted as an unbreakable floor for nine years, with the price never closing below it. While the market has dipped under this line multiple times in the past, every attempt to break down has ultimately failed, maintaining a remarkably consistent structural defense. Related Reading: Litecoin Follows Bitcoin’s Momentum, But Resistance Looms At $79.60 Currently, the market environment is putting this nearly decade-long support to the test once again. Dixon emphasizes that we cannot rely on intra-month volatility to determine the outcome. Instead, the definitive signal rests solely on the monthly candle close. This closing price will serve as a macro-economic pivot point that dictates the primary direction for the coming months. A successful hold above the trend line would be a powerful bullish confirmation, suggesting the long-term uptrend remains intact despite external pressures. Conversely, a confirmed close below this line would shift the narrative to bearish, marking a historic breakdown of a nine-year support system. Specific technical triggers are also in play, particularly the $63 level. Dixon warns that falling below $63 would be devastating, as it would effectively nullify the hidden bullish divergence currently supporting the price. Given these risks, Dixon recommends exercising patience until the monthly close or ensuring strict stop losses are in place for any active trades.

    "title": "Bitcoin Stuck In Bear Mode For 83 Days: Trend Pulse Confirms Structural Weakness",
    "body": "Bitcoin continues to struggle as it attempts to reclaim the $90,000 level, with traders facing a market defined by hesitation rather than conviction. After yesterday’s bearish breakdown below $90K, price action has slipped back into indecisive territory, raising fresh questions about whether this pullback is a temporary shakeout or the start of a deeper corrective phase. Related Reading: XRP Distribution Phase Continues, But Funding Rates Suggest Shorts Are Overextended According to top analyst Axel Adler, a macro indicator called Trend Pulse helps explain why momentum has faded. Adler notes that since January 19, the market has remained in Bear Mode, with the Bull phase absent for 83 consecutive days. Two separate charts reinforce this shift, showing that both short-term momentum and quarterly performance have turned negative at the same time. Trend Pulse recently shifted from Neutral to Bear, driven by a double-negative setup: the 14-day return has flipped red, and the SMA30 versus SMA200 trend signal is also negative. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s quarterly return sits at -19%, confirming macro weakness, but without the kind of extreme that often signals a definitive bottom. Bitcoin Remains Stuck In Bear Mode As Macro Signals Stay Negative Adler notes that Bitcoin’s last Bull Mode signal was printed on November 2, 2025, when BTC traded near $110,000—roughly 83 days ago. Since then, the market has failed to regain structural strength. Even the Neutral stretch between December 30 and January 18 proved too short and too weak to restore the long-term trend, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable once selling pressure returned. Adler explains that the first trigger for improvement is the 14-day return moving back above 0, which would shift the regime from Bear to Neutral. However, a full transition back into Bull Mode requires a second condition: SMA30 breaking above SMA200. Given the current divergence between the two averages, that crossover would likely demand 3–4 weeks of sustained upside rather than a short-lived bounce. The Bitcoin Price Performance chart adds macro context by tracking quarterly return (90D) as a sentiment proxy. Historically, readings above +75% align with euphoria, while values below 0% signal pessimism, and drops below -30% reflect capitulation. Bitcoin’s quarterly return sits near -19%, negative but far from deep bear-market extremes. Yet the 7-day change (-6.8%) suggests downside momentum is accelerating after the $90K breakdown. Together, Trend Pulse and quarterly returns point to moderate pessimism without final capitulation, leaving the market at a decision point. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Stalls At 71%: Still Not Enough For A Sustainable Recovery BTC Moving Averages Cap Recovery Bitcoin is trading near $89,000 after failing to hold above the $90,000 psychological level, reinforcing the market’s current indecision. The chart shows BTC printing a lower-high structure since the early November peak, followed by a sharp selloff that reset price into a wide consolidation range. After bottoming in late November, Bitcoin rebounded but struggled to build sustained momentum, repeatedly stalling on push attempts toward the mid-$90K zone. From a trend perspective, BTC remains pressured beneath its key moving averages. Price is trading below the green long-term average and the blue mid-term average, both of which are now sloping downward, signaling that broader momentum continues to lean bearish. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Power Shift: New Whales Now Control The Market The most recent rejection occurred as BTC briefly pushed into the $95K–$97K area, only to roll over and break back down toward the range lows. Meanwhile, the red long-term average remains well above price near the low-$100Ks, highlighting how far BTC would need to recover to reestablish a stronger macro uptrend. Volume has picked up on selloffs relative to bounces, suggesting that downside moves are still being met with more urgency. For bulls, reclaiming $90K and then holding above $92K–$94K is key. Otherwise, the chart keeps risk open for a deeper pullback toward the mid-$80K region. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Showing Strength, Analyst Points To $4 Potential",
    "body": "XRP has begun attracting attention again after months of sideways trading. The coin has risen slightly over the past day, though it remains down for the week. Traders are pointing to familiar chart patterns, suggesting the quiet period may be nearing an end. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sharp Reversal Leaves Over $800 Million Liquidated In 1 Day Traders Spot A Familiar Price Pattern A fresh take on XRP came from DonWedge, who posted a half-day chart on TradingView. Though he kept it short – just “XRP looks good” – the message carried weight. Instead of bold predictions, his analysis leaned on patterns. A downward-sloping channel draws the eye, much like one seen months before. Shape echoes past rhythm. What stands out is how closely current movement tracks earlier behavior. The image tells part of the story; context fills in the rest. Time will show whether history bends toward repetition. That old rise in XRP moved fast. Following that climb, it slipped into a steady decline lasting around half a year. Once sellers slowed their pace, the price jumped again without warning. $XRP looks good pic.twitter.com/OnyChRVzNp — Don 🐂 (@DonWedge) January 21, 2026 Fresh lows in XRP’s path hug the bottom stretch of a familiar range, pressure easing – some watchful eyes guess what comes next might climb. Volume And Resistance Are Key According to reports, the next major hurdle is a multi-month trendline resistance near $2.10. A clean daily close above this line, combined with rising volume, could signal the start of a new uptrend. DonWedge projects that if the breakout occurs, XRP could aim for $4. From current levels, this would require a little over a 100% increase. Traders note, however, that moves without volume confirmation can fail, leading to false breakouts and extended consolidation. Market Expert Projects A Telling Year Based on reports, analyst ChartNerd says 2026 will be a “telling year” for XRP. He expects the coin either to confirm a strong breakout with fresh momentum or to fall below the structure it has defended for over a year. After a macro breakout in Q4 2024, $XRP has been accumulating above its prior 2021 highs for over a year. The whole of 2025 was sideways, boring, and a test of even the most durable minds. 2026 is going to be the telling year. Compression typically leads to expansion. Buckle up. pic.twitter.com/QJb7JAmIkL — 🇬🇧 ChartNerd 📊 (@ChartNerdTA) January 18, 2026 Lately, the sideways grind has worn thin for some investors – yet hints of resilience still flicker through the numbers. Breaking past $2.10 with force might spark what comes next, lining up with the pattern DonWedge laid out on his chart. Patience now may quietly pay off later. Related Reading: Bitcoin Influencers Get Spotlight In X’s New ‘Starterpacks’ A Breakout Might Shift What Happens Next A sudden jump in price might push XRP toward $4 fast, provided it finishes above the trendline with strong movement. Higher goals are possible, yet reaching them means buyers keep stepping in without pause. So far, things look cautious rather than certain. Traders will probably keep an eye on activity levels, holding back bigger moves until signs become clearer. What happens next might show if XRP surges again or just drifts sideways some more.

    "title": "Bitcoin Indicator Falls Back To Post-Bear Market Levels: Investors Approach A Key Decision Point",
    "body": "Bitcoin is trading below the $90,000 level once again, as the market continues to drift through a phase defined by indecision, rising caution, and growing fear. After repeated failures to reclaim this psychological threshold, price action has started to reflect a lack of conviction on both sides, with buyers hesitating to step in aggressively and sellers pressing every rebound attempt. While the broader trend has not fully collapsed, the inability to hold key levels is increasing uncertainty around Bitcoin’s next major move. Related Reading: XRP Distribution Phase Continues, But Funding Rates Suggest Shorts Are Overextended Top analyst Darkfost argues that on-chain signals are starting to mirror conditions typically seen near the end of prolonged drawdowns. According to his analysis, Bitcoin’s unrealized profits and losses are sliding back toward levels that have historically appeared only at the exit of bear markets, when the market has already absorbed a deep reset in sentiment. This shift suggests that stress is building under the surface, even if price has not yet entered a full capitulation phase. Since Bitcoin’s last all-time high, Darkfost notes that many late-arriving investors have moved into uncomfortable territory, facing mounting downside pressure as the market cools. As a result, unrealized profits are shrinking, unrealized losses are expanding, and the overall balance continues to deteriorate—an environment that often forces traders into a decisive choice between holding through volatility or exiting under stress. Decision Point For Bitcoin Investors Darkfost highlighted a chart based on an adjusted version of NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss), designed to capture investor stress more accurately during shifting market regimes. Instead of relying solely on the standard market cap, the model incorporates the realized capitalization of both Short-Term Holders (STHs) and Long-Term Holders (LTHs), then compares that blended realized foundation against Bitcoin’s traditional market cap. The result is a clearer view of how much profit or loss sits “on paper” across the market, filtered through a more structural lens. To reduce noise and better define trend shifts, the metric is smoothed using an average, producing what Darkfost refers to as aNUPL. The key takeaway is that Bitcoin is approaching levels that have historically forced investors into a binary decision. When unrealized profits compress and unrealized losses expand to these ranges, holders typically face two outcomes: hold and continue accumulating, or capitulate and lock in losses. That difference in behavior becomes critical because it shapes liquidity, sentiment, and the next directional trend. If long-term participants absorb the pressure and keep holding, the market can stabilize and rotate back into recovery. But if selling accelerates from stressed cohorts, the decline can deepen into a broader bear phase. This is why tracking realized and unrealized profit dynamics remains essential, especially during periods of uncertainty. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Stalls At 71%: Still Not Enough For A Sustainable Recovery Bitcoin Consolidates After Sharp Weekly Breakdown Bitcoin is trading around $89,000 on the weekly chart after a steep selloff that pushed the price out of its prior distribution zone. The latest candle reflects heavy downside pressure, with BTC dropping roughly 4.8% on the week and struggling to stabilize near a key pivot that has repeatedly acted as support and resistance throughout the cycle. After failing to hold above the psychological $90,000 threshold, the market is now trapped in a tight consolidation range, suggesting traders are waiting for confirmation before committing to a larger move. Related Reading: Ethereum Supply Tightens On Binance As Reserves Hit Lowest Level Since 2016 From a trend standpoint, Bitcoin remains vulnerable as it trades below the blue moving average, which is now acting as overhead resistance near the low-$100K region. The rejection from that dynamic level aligns with the broader structure: BTC topped near the mid-$120K range, then entered a sharp corrective leg that reset momentum into early 2026. While the green moving average continues to slope upward and is approaching the current price zone, the market has not yet shown the strength needed to reclaim its former trend trajectory. Importantly, the weekly structure is now compressing. If buyers can defend the $88K–$90K region and push BTC back above $92K–$95K, it would signal a recovery attempt toward the moving average band. However, a sustained failure here increases the risk of a deeper retracement toward the low-$80K zone, where prior demand previously emerged. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Expert Forecasts $5 XRP Price As Exchange Balances Plummet By 57%",
    "body": "XRP has given back all of its early‑year gains, sliding toward the $1.90. Despite the pullback, several on‑chain and market indicators are pointing to a possible breakout from current levels, driven largely by a sharp decline in XRP held on exchanges. XRP Exchange Balances Slide To 1.5B Market analyst Sam Daodu notes that over the past months, a substantial portion of XRP has steadily moved off centralized trading platforms and into long‑term storage and institutional custody. On‑chain figures indicate that XRP exchange balances dropped from roughly 4 billion tokens in early 2025 to about 1.5 billion by late December. This 57% decline represents the steepest annual reduction in XRP exchange supply on record. Related Reading: Binance Forms New Company In Greece, Moves Forward With MiCA Licensing Data from CryptoQuant reinforces this trend, showing shrinking XRP reserves on major trading platforms such as Binance, where balances continued to fall into early 2026. At the same time, wallet accumulation has increased, particularly among institutional custody accounts. Daodu argues that with fewer tokens available on exchanges, buying pressure that previously moved XRP only marginally can now drive gains of 10% to 15% within days. When combined with approximately $1.37 billion in XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows recorded since November 2025, Daodu believes the conditions favor a potential breakout toward the $4 to $5 range, rather than another rally that stalls below $3. Bullish, Base, And Bearish Scenarios Looking ahead, Daodu outlines three broad price paths for XRP, each tied to how exchange balances and ETF inflows evolve. In a bullish scenario, the altcoin could move into the $4 to $5 range if monthly ETF inflows average $300-$500 million and exchange balances fall below 1.5 billion tokens. A more neutral outcome would see XRP trading between $2.50 and $3.50. This scenario assumes ETF inflows slow to roughly $50 million to $70 million per week and exchange balances continue to decline at a steadier pace. Related Reading: Expert Analyzes XRP, Ethereum, And Solana: Predictions For The Next Altcoin Season The bearish case hinges on the possibility that the supply contraction thesis proves overstated. If rapid transfers refill exchange order books, escrow releases increase selling pressure, or ETF demand slows due to tighter macroeconomic conditions, XRP could lose support. In that scenario, prices may fall below $2.00 and revisit the $1.60 level during periods of risk aversion. Prolonged uncertainty could see XRP trading between $1.50 and $2.00 for much of 2026, according to the analyst. At the time of writing, the altcoin was trading at $1.94. This represented losses of 4% and 8% over seven and fourteen-day periods, respectively. This positions the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap 46% below the current all-time high of $3.64 reached back in July of last year.

    "title": "Dogecoin Wedge Breakout Could Be “Powerful,” Analyst Says",
    "body": "Dogecoin is potentially following a Falling Wedge right now, and this cryptocurrency analyst thinks a breakout from it may be a “powerful” one. Dogecoin Could Be Trading Inside A Falling Wedge Pattern In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a Falling Wedge that Dogecoin is potentially trading inside on the weekly timeframe. A “Wedge” is a pattern from technical analysis (TA) that forms whenever the asset’s price trades between two converging trendlines. A “Triangle” consolidation channel also involves converging trendlines, but the difference from a Wedge is that it either involves one trendline that’s horizontally flat or trendlines that converge with an opposite slope. On the other hand, a Wedge involves trendlines sloped in the same direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply Overhang Likely To Cap Rallies Above $98,400, Glassnode Says When these lines point in the up direction, the pattern formed is known as a Rising Wedge. Similarly, their being sloped downward creates a Falling Wedge. The latter is the Wedge of interest in the current discussion. Like other consolidation patterns in TA, the upper line of a Falling Wedge is also likely to be a source of resistance, while the lower one is that of support. A breakout of either of these bounds can signal a sustained move in that direction. Wedges are generally considered to be either continuation or reversal patterns, depending on the prevailing price trend. When a Falling Wedge is preceded by an upward price trajectory, the pattern is assumed to be one pertaining to a bullish continuation. Similarly, it acts as a reversal pattern during a downtrend. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Falling Wedge that Dogecoin has been stuck inside for the past year: As displayed in the above graph, Dogecoin’s weekly price has retraced to the lower level of the Falling Wedge recently, suggesting the pattern’s support is being retested. In the same chart, the analyst has highlighted some Falling Wedges that Dogecoin traveled through in the past. It would appear that each of these ended up holding as bullish continuation patterns and led to upward breakouts. In terms of the width, the latest Wedge has been the largest among these.

It now remains to be seen whether the support line of the channel will hold for the memecoin this time and if a breakout will follow. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.125, down more than 9% over the last seven days. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP At ‘Critical Inflection Point’: Analyst Signals Major Expansion If This Level Holds",
    "body": "As XRP attempts to climb to higher levels, an analyst affirmed that the altcoin is “doing what it needs to do” to continue its bullish rally, highlighting multiple key structures in key timeframes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Foundation-Backed ETF Launches On Nasdaq As Analysts Call For Massive DOGE Rally XRP Enters Inflection Point After retesting the $1.90 area on Friday morning, XRP saw a 4.6% intraday bounce toward the mid-zone of its local range. Over the past five days, the cryptocurrency has been hovering in the $1.85-$2.00 price range, failing to hold the upper zone of this range. Market watcher ChartNerd pointed out a key reversal pattern that could signal a massive price expansion may be around the corner, noting that the altcoin is at a “critical inflection point” as it retests a macro support zone. He explained that a running flat ABC correction formation is “a sophisticated structure where the failure of the ‘C’ wave to breach previous lows signals underlying bullish strength.” XRP has been mirroring the same structure over the past 400 days, which would point “toward a structural breakout, marking the transition from a yearly long base into a new primary uptrend” if it resolves. As the chart shows, “the wave counts repeating toward the structure are evident in XRP’s price action,” and as long as the macro support holds, around the $1.80 area, the C wave “could be working in the bulls’ defense.” We could be just building a base above $1.80, marking the C wave in this running flat correction before the major breakout. ChartNerd added that there could be a scenario in which XRP deviates below its major support before a V-shape recovery. However, he warned that losing this area would not be healthy, detailing that the only way to invalidate the pattern would be for the price to close below the structure’s support, retest it as resistance, and drop to lower levels. XRP’s Price Defends Macro Support The analyst emphasized the importance of the $1.80 level, noting that XRP has been defending this territory for over a year and could lead to a new all-time high (ATH) rally. “This is a macro accumulation zone, and we evidently also have two major levels of descending resistance for XRP,” he detailed, highlighting that when the first multi-month descending resistance broke, the altcoin rallied to a new all-time high. It’s pretty simple: we have descending resistance on our heads at the moment, and we once had a point of contact on this resistance at the $2.40 high (…) So, at this moment in time, the simplicity tells us: break the descending resistance, and this is where XRP really starts gearing up for further expansion. Based on this, ChartNerd asserted that if the altcoin defends the $1.80 macro support, then a similar rally is likely. Similarly, he pointed to a bullish reversal structure building below the key $2.70 resistance on XRP’s chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $80,000? Analyst Warns Of Potential Free Fall As BTC Erases 2026 Gains Per the post, the cryptocurrency formed a three-month falling wedge pattern that was broken out of during the early January rally. Now, the price is retesting the pattern’s breakout level as support and could be preparing to climb toward the level it started forming. “So XRP just needs to defend the guard at $1.80, and this is where we could be looking for that sort of major expansion and looking to press back up to the target of $2.70,” before potentially challenging its pre-Q4 range, he concluded.

    "title": "Crypto Meets Private Banking: UBS Weighs New Offering",
    "body": "Reports say Swiss banking giant UBS is planning to let a small group of its private bank clients buy and sell major cryptocurrencies. The step would open access to Bitcoin and Ethereum for people who have worked with the bank for years, not for every customer. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sharp Reversal Leaves Over $800 Million Liquidated In 1 Day Private Clients First According to a Bloomberg report, the service would start in Switzerland and be offered only to select private banking clients, with any wider rollout dependent on rules and demand. The move is careful and measured. It is being tested with a narrow set of clients before any wider push is considered. How It Would Work Reports note that UBS has been talking with outside firms about providing the trading, custody and compliance pieces needed to make crypto trading run smoothly. Partners would likely handle technical tasks while UBS keeps the client relationship front and center. Those talks have been going on for months, and no final deals are said to be done yet. Why Now Wealthy clients have been asking for ways to own digital assets safely. UBS has run pilots on tokenized funds and has worked on blockchain payments before. The bank’s size and reputation mean it can offer a more cautious path into crypto than many smaller players. At the same time, changes in regulation and the broader market have made the plan more realistic than it might have seemed a few years ago. Based on reports, the initial offering would focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum. More coins could be added later, but that would depend on which assets meet the bank’s risk and compliance checks. UBS will reportedly decide what custody model to use and whether it needs third parties for trade execution. No launch date has been set. A Broader Trend Banks from different countries are slowly giving rich clients more ways to touch crypto, but each does it in its own style. Some offer ETFs and funds. Some go further and let clients trade coins directly. UBS’s cautious design fits a pattern where big banks move slowly, testing the systems before widening access. A handful of recent moves by other institutions show the same pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Influencers Get Spotlight In X’s New ‘Starterpacks’ What Comes Next Reports note that regulators and client interest will help decide how fast this goes. If rules in the US and other places stay friendly and clients respond, the offering could broaden beyond Switzerland. If not, the bank could keep the plan tightly limited. For now, the idea remains a plan under discussion rather than a product on the market. UBS’s steps reflect growing demand from wealthy investors for safer ways to hold crypto through trusted firms. The bank’s careful progress shows how traditional finance is testing the waters without rushing in. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Price Still Has Room To Fall Below $60K — Crypto CEO",
    "body": "The Bitcoin price had a relatively rough trading period over the past week, as it hovered around the psychological $90,000 mark. The flagship cryptocurrency, which looked set for a return to six-figure valuation barely over a week ago, now seems to have lost all its bullish momentum. Broadly speaking, these recent struggles put to rest questions around the “relief rallies” to the upside, and correlate more with the current bear market structure. However, the latest on-chain evaluation shows that the Bitcoin price woes could worsen from here on out. Expert Explains Why $60,000 Is Possible For BTC Price In a recent post on the X platform, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson said that the Bitcoin price could still have room to fall below the $60,000 level. This not-so-optimistic prediction is based on the number of days Bitcoin has traded at prices higher than today. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Stalls At 71%: Still Not Enough For A Sustainable Recovery According to Wedson, there have been 355 days when the Bitcoin price has traded at levels higher than today. This figure was derived from the “Days Spent at a Profit” metric, which tracks the number of days in Bitcoin’s history where the market price was higher than the current price. This indicator measures how much price action — in the past — has occurred above the current price level. From a historical standpoint, an increase in the number of “Days Spent at a Profit” tends to occur during bear cycles or extended periods of sideways movement, implying that different investor groups are holding BTC at a price higher than their cost bases. As Wedson highlighted, the “Days Spent at a Profit” metric reached around 775 days as the Bitcoin price approached a bottom. Going by this historical context, the current level of this indicator (355 days) suggests that the flagship cryptocurrency is still a distance away from extreme levels often associated with bearish market bottoms. Ultimately, this deduction means that the price of Bitcoin could still be at risk of an extended decline over the next 300 days. According to the Alphractal, this extended period of price decline could see BTC revisit $60,000, potentially triggering significant liquidations among retail investors and institutional players who entered the market post-ETF. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $89,900, reflecting no significant change in the past 24 hours. However, the market leader is currently down by over 5% on the weekly timeframe, while nearly 30% adrift its all-time high of $126,080. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Revisit $97,600?

    "title": "Bitcoin Metric Suggests Miners Are In Recovery Mode — Price To Follow?",
    "body": "Over the past week, the price of Bitcoin faced a significant setback in its goal of reclaiming the six-figure threshold. The flagship cryptocurrency has been hovering around the $90,000 mark, as the market can’t seem to make a decision concerning the next price direction. As Bitcoin faced a mild sell-off, which, in turn, drove its price to fall from its recent highs, specific market participants were under severe pressure, including the miners. Interestingly, a recent on-chain evaluation has raised the possibility that miners’ stress might be ending soon. Miner Financial Health Flashes Classic Reversal Sign In a January 23 post on the social media platform X, market expert Axel Adler Jr highlighted that the Bitcoin miners might have started their post-capitulation recovery journey. The relevant indicator here is the Miner Financial Health Index (7D-SMA). Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Bear Mode For 83 Days: Trend Pulse Confirms Structural Weakness For context, this metric tracks the balance between miner revenue and miner selling pressure. Hence, it reflects whether miners are net BTC distributors or accumulators. Simply put, the metric shows if Bitcoin miners are under pressure, stable, or even profitable. Capitulation events often reflect on the Miner Health Index as a negative value, as the amount of BTC spent surpasses the amount of BTC earned. On the other hand, miners are typically said to be in the recovery phase when the balance between revenue and spending starts to lean away from the negative. From the chart shared by the analyst, it is apparent that the index has taken on an uptrend, targeting neutral levels on the metric’s charts. History shows that the index does not merely target the neutral mark when it trends upward. Hence, if history were to repeat itself, the Bitcoin miners could be in for a rewarding ride, having survived the most recent capitulation event. Interestingly, the price of Bitcoin appears to have a directly proportional relationship with the Miner Health Index. Bitcoin Price Gathers Momentum As Market Condition Shifts In a separate post on X, Bitcoin Vector highlighted that Bitcoin might be garnering strength for a significant move in the near term. According to the analytics platform, this development coincides with the market exiting what was previously a “high-risk environment.” Bitcoin Vector explained that this exit from a risky market environment was last seen in April 2025, just before the bull run resumed. The on-chain analytics firm explained that we could be witnessing the late stages of a classic momentum bottoming pattern, which historically leads to large rallies. Essentially, there has to be one last push lower in price and, at the same time, a momentum boost to the upside, for the bullish signal to be completely formed. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at around $89,830 with no significant movement in the past 24 hours.
