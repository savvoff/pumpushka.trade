    "title": "Ethereum Forms Wyckoff Breakout Setup: $10,000 Price Target Back In Focus",
    "body": "A recent technical analysis shared on X by crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader presents Ethereum’s price action on the 2-day candlestick chart as a textbook example of Wyckoff accumulation. In his assessment, Ethereum has already moved through several key stages of the model and is now approaching a powerful expansion phase, provided the structure stays intact. Related Reading: American Bitcoin Makes Big Buy, Adds 416 BTC To Its Stack Wyckoff Accumulation Structure Taking Shape On Ethereum Chart Over the past several days, Ethereum has traded between roughly $3,050 and $3,400, repeatedly failing to secure a sustained move beyond either boundary. At the time of writing, Ethereum’s price action is trading around $3,100. This prolonged standoff has reinforced the view that Ethereum has returned to consolidating rather than trading in a defined trend, a behavior that aligns closely with the accumulation phase highlighted in a technical analysis by Merlijn The Trader. In his post, Merlijn described Ethereum’s chart as a “Wyckoff masterclass,” pointing to a sequence of events that align with textbook behavior from the Wyckoff accumulation schematic, which have been playing out for the entirety of 2025. According to the annotated structure, the spring occurred when ETH briefly dipped below $1,500 in the first half of the year. Price did not linger below that level for long, reclaiming the range within days and going on a rally that eventually ended at a selling climax (SC) of $4,946 Within this structure, the initial selling climax and automatic downtrend reaction established a clear range in which the cryptocurrency has been trading up until now. The chart labels show this as Ethereum moving through Phase D, and this has been highlighted by a downtrend in recent months. However, based on the Wyckoff framework, Ethereum seems to now be approaching the breakout zone, with a transition into a full Phase E and a potential vertical markup coming next if the structure continues to play out. Phase E Projection Points To Strong Upside Scenario If the Wyckoff roadmap continues to unfold as outlined, Merlijn believes Ethereum is setting up for a full Phase E, the final stage of the accumulation process. This phase is characterized by a sustained markup, where price exits the selling climax (SC) decisively and trends higher with increasing momentum. Ethereum / US Dollar: @MerlijnTrader on X The projection on the chart shows a sharp upside expansion once overhead resistance is cleared, with Merlijn pointing to $10,000 and higher as a long-term objective if the structure completes. The path higher is not expected to be linear. The model anticipates an initial push into new all-time highs, followed by a modest rejection around the $5,000 area before the price pauses to consolidate towards the Backup and Last Point of Support Related Reading: Do Kwon Falls Hard — Terraform Labs Chief Gets 15 Years For Wire Fraud According to the chart, this BU/LPS would likely form around $3,750. If Ethereum holds above that level during the pullback, it would confirm structural strength, with the subsequent expansion targeting above $10,000.

    "title": "Bitcoin Headed For $200 Trillion? CEO Makes Bold Prediction",
    "body": "A new public company with a big Bitcoin stash is pitching a bold claim. Twenty One Capital, which listed on the New York Stock Exchange on December 9, arrived with close to $4 billion Bitcoin treasury and now holds the third-largest BTC reserve among public firms. According to the firm’s CEO, Jack Mallers, Bitcoin’s role could expand far beyond a speculative holding. Related Reading: Solana’s Long-Awaited Firedancer Launch Sparks 5% Rally CEO Sees Bitcoin As A Reserve Asset Mallers told viewers on theCUBE+NYSE Wired that Bitcoin has compounded holders’ portfolios at roughly 50% a year over the past five to 10 years. Based on reports, he expects that the current $2 trillion market for Bitcoin could grow to between $20 trillion and $200 trillion. He argued Bitcoin might become the next global reserve asset as finance “recollateralizes” itself away from traditional treasuries and government debt. If supply then stood at 20 million tokens when a 100x market rise happened, Bitcoin would trade near $10 million per coin. At a present price of $92,270, that outcome would equal an increase of about 10,730%. Market Signals Remain Mixed Short-term market signs are not all in favor of a big rally. According to market watchers, the Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut barely moved Bitcoin, leaving price action largely flat and directionless. The MACD histogram, however, is showing hints of bullish momentum in some technical reads, which suggests buyers may be warming up. The dollar index is showing signs of weakness, which often helps assets like Bitcoin. ETF flows keep disappointing. Without steady inflows from funds, big narratives can struggle to turn into lasting price gains. Product Push Aimed At Liquidity Without Selling Twenty One Capital says it wants to offer services that let holders tap liquidity without selling their coins. The firm plans to start in credit and lending and has said it will roll out products in partnership with Tether. Related Reading: Do Kwon Falls Hard — Terraform Labs Chief Gets 15 Years For Wire Fraud Mallers described the company as more than a balance-sheet accumulator; he compared their ambitions to Coinbase while stressing a narrower focus on Bitcoin services. If executed, these offerings could change how holders manage risk and cash needs. Big Numbers And Big Questions The projection to $200 trillion is headline-grabbing. It is a vision, not a forecast, and it hinges on major shifts in global finance and adoption. Reports note that other industry figures have offered similar long-term targets, which means the idea is not unique but remains highly debated. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "XRP Holders Labeled ‘Uneducated Perma Bulls’ By Veteran Trader – Details",
    "body": "Veteran market trader Peter Brandt has reignited debate around XRP after issuing sharp remarks about the token’s most loyal supporters. Drawing from a career that spans more than five decades, Brandt grouped XRP alongside silver when describing markets where bullish belief often holds firm despite repeated price swings and long periods of disappointment. Related Reading: Do Kwon Falls Hard — Terraform Labs Chief Gets 15 Years For Wire Fraud According to people familiar with his comments, Brandt grounded his criticism in personal trading history. He said he has handled thousands of contracts across commodities, equity benchmarks, and digital assets, and argued that the “perma bulls who I find most uneducated and biased are those who trumpet Silver and XRP,” pointing to what he sees as a pattern of investors staying bullish even when price action and broader conditions turn against them. Brandt Highlights Decades Of Experience Brandt’s tone was blunt and personal. He has a long record of public commentary, and his criticisms of XRP are part of a pattern that stretches back years. Earlier this month he called XRP supporters “obsessed” and compared their conviction to that of silver bulls. For 50 years I have traded many thousands of contracts of every commodity, stock indexes and as many cryptos as you can think of The perma bulls who I find most uneducated and biased are those who trumpet Silver and XRP — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 12, 2025 At times he has made bearish forecasts — including predictions that XRP would slide toward zero against Bitcoin — while at other moments he identified bullish chart patterns and set higher targets that were later hit before the market reversed. Community Pushback And Surprises Responses came fast. Zach Rector, a known figure in the XRP space, pushed back on Brandt’s view. Reports disclosed that Bitcoin maximalist YoungHoon Kim said on December 12 that he would start buying XRP — a notable shift for someone who had favored Bitcoin exclusively. Kim has claimed an IQ of 276, a detail many readers flagged as unverifiable, but it was repeated in social posts and prompted discussion. X Finance Bull accepted Brandt’s trading record but suggested that charts alone may miss broader structural moves in crypto markets. Dr. Don Woods, a self-described silver bull, joked that triple-digit returns had left him unbothered by labels of bias or ignorance. XRP: Price Context And Market Moves According to market snapshots tied to the exchanges, XRP traded above $3 at one point before slipping toward the lower end of the $2 region. Volume and broader crypto swings played parts in that move. Brandt’s critics point to that resilience as proof his calls are sometimes off. His supporters say his track record over five decades still deserves weight. Both views are in circulation, and both are being used to argue different investment cases. 10,000 XRP And The Freedom Argument Meanwhile, Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has kept a steady bullish stance. Based on his past posts, he argued that holding 10,000 XRP could put an investor in a special position if prices rise enough. Related Reading: American Bitcoin Makes Big Buy, Adds 416 BTC To Its Stack “It’s hard to understand how free you’ll be,” he wrote in one message that was later shared widely. That claim contains no timeline or clear price targets. It is a conviction play, not a forecast built from disclosed assumptions. The differing views is part of a wider debate about bias, data, and belief in crypto. Some traders treat Brandt’s words as a warning against unchecked optimism. Others treat community pushback as evidence that XRP’s story is not settled and that broader factors — legal, regulatory, and adoption-related — could change the math.

    "body": "XRP price started a fresh decline below $2.00. The price is now struggling and faces resistance near the $2.020 resistance level. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.00 zone. The price is now trading below $2.00 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.020 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below $1.950. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price attempted a recovery wave above $2.120 but failed to continue higher, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price started a fresh decline below $2.050 and $2.020. There was a move below the $2.00 support level. A low was formed at $1.9525, and the price recently started an upside correction. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.047 swing high to the $1.952 low. However, the bears are active near $2.00 and $2.020. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.020 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.00 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.00 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.020 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.047 swing high to the $1.952 low. A close above $2.020 could send the price to $2.050. The next hurdle sits at $2.080. A clear move above the $2.120 resistance might send the price toward the $2.150 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.20 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.250. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.020 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.9650 level. The next major support is near the $1.950 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.950 level, the price might continue to decline toward $1.920. The next major support sits near the $1.880 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.820. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $1.950 and $1.920. Major Resistance Levels – $2.020 and $2.050.",

    "title": "Hashdex Unveils Its Top 3 Crypto Predictions For 2026",
    "body": "Hashdex is out with its 2026 crypto investment outlook, and the vibe is pretty clear: stop treating crypto like a weird side-bet and start treating it like… an allocation. The firm’s CIO Samir Kerbage says “most investors” should be thinking in the 5–10% range, framing it as a pragmatic response to a messier macro regime (sticky inflation risk, debt burdens, the 60/40 portfolio looking less like a law of nature and more like a historical artifact). Look, you can debate the exact number, but Hashdex’s point is that the underweight has become the active decision. Crypto is now “well above $3 trillion” in market cap and about 1% of the global investable market by its math—meaning a sub-1% allocation is basically a deliberate fade. They also cite a Charles Schwab survey where 45% of financial advisors said they planned to allocate to crypto ETFs over the next year. And they’re not just waving their hands. Hashdex runs a simple portfolio thought experiment: adding crypto exposure (represented by the Nasdaq Crypto Index US) to a 60/40 improves risk-adjusted returns in their backtest window, with higher allocations juicing total return while, yes, drawdowns get uglier. That trade-off isn’t hidden — it’s the whole point of sizing the position instead of YOLO’ing it. Related Reading: Crypto Tanks After Fed Cut: Santiment Breaks Down The Trap But the meat of the report isn’t “buy crypto because number go up.” It’s three themes, three predictions — basically a roadmap for what they think does the heavy lifting in 2026. Top 3 Crypto Predictions For 2026 First up: the “cryptodollar”. Hashdex argues stablecoins are starting to do something geopolitically weird and financially consequential: while some sovereigns try to de-dollarize, stablecoins re-dollarize at the user and corporate level, with issuers recycling that demand into short-duration Treasuries. Their baseline is stablecoins going from roughly $295 billion to well over $500 billion in 2026. If that accelerates, they suggest it changes the shape of Treasury demand — in one scenario, stablecoin growth could shorten the average duration of US debt by around four months (because the backing skews short). That’s the kind of detail bond people obsess over. Crypto people probably should, too. Related Reading: Will The Crypto Market Benefit From The Trump Fed Takeover? Second: tokenization finally acting like a flywheel instead of a conference slide. Hashdex points to tokenized RWAs at roughly $36 billion as of late 2025 and says the market could grow 10x to about $400 billion by end-2026. They also flag that tokenized Treasury bills have already climbed to over $8 billion, from a little above $700 million two years earlier. They namecheck real-world rollout examples — BlackRock’s liquidity fund, Franklin Templeton’s on-chain government money fund, UBS’s tokenized VCC fund in Singapore, Siemens’ on-chain bond — as proof this isn’t just crypto teams talking to themselves anymore. “We’re not spending enough time talking about how quickly we’re going to tokenize every financial asset.” Third: AI, but not the “add AI to the pitch deck” version. Hashdex says decentralized AI networks pulled nearly $1 billion in venture funding in 2025, largely aimed at problems like verification, coordination, and compute cost. Their call is the “AI Crypto” segment growing from about $3 billion to $10 billion in 2026. The throughline is simple even if the plumbing isn’t: stablecoins deepen on-chain liquidity, tokenization pulls more assets onto rails, and AI pushes demand for crypto-native infrastructure that can verify and coordinate without a single gatekeeper. Hashdex’s punchline is that 2026 is when “exploratory” turns into “strategic.” Not a tidy ending, sure — but markets rarely give you one. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.03 trillion. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin Holds Demand Zone Above $0.13, What A Bounce Would Do",
    "body": "As the eventful year of 2025 draws to an end, crypto analysts are looking into what the Dogecoin price could hold for investors going into the end of the year. One of these analysts is BitGuru, who shared an interest in the Dogecoin price chart, highlighting the next possible roadmap that the meme coin could take. With the possibility of a bounce rising, the next targets have become increasingly important to identify in order to maximize gains. Why The Dogecoin Price Could Recover Quickly BitGuru’s analysis focuses on the rising demand surrounding the meme coin after finding support from the recent crash. The Dogecoin price had stopped above $0.13, suggesting that the demand at this level continues to hold strong as buyers return to the market. Related Reading: Reasons Why XRP’s Technical Structure Favors Upside Than Down Over Next 6 Months Pointing out this demand, the crypto analyst explains that the Dogecoin price is actually holding the demand zone after a prolonged downtrend. This is often bullish for the digital asset as it shows rising interest in the cryptocurrency as it establishes new support levels. This base formation, as the analyst calls it, could serve as the starting point for the next rally that could push the Dogecoin price higher. However, for this to happen, the Dogecoin bulls would have to maintain their position above this demand level. If this support level is held, then BitGuru forecasts that the Dogecoin price could start to recover again. This bounce could lead to a 50% increase, with the analyst’s chart outline putting it as high as $0.188. The upper end of the rally shows the price climbing to $0.22 before hitting resistance. End Of Year Could End Red Interestingly, the last quarter of the year has often been reasonably bullish for the Dogecoin price, but the year 2025 has deviated hard. So far, the quarter is already 41.8% deep in the red, according to data from the CryptoRank website, and it doesn’t look like that would change anytime soon. Related Reading: XRP Mirrors 2016 Trend That Led To 69% Crash Before 110,000% Rally The Dogecoin price is already down more than 7.5% in the month of December so far, contributing to the decline that has been felt in the quarter. The months of October and November ended in the red with 20% and 21.3% losses, respectively, and if this trend continues, then the Dogecoin price could follow suit.
