    "title": "XRP Price At $10 Too Low? Pundit Says That’s For Retail, Reveals Institutional Targets",
    "body": "Crypto pundit XRP Queen has described an XRP price target of $10 as being too low, claiming that this target was from a retail investor’s perspective. She also suggested how high the altcoin could go from an institutional standpoint. Pundit Claims XRP Price Target Of $10 Is Too Low In an X post, XRP Queen stated that people predicting XRP price targets of between $10 and $25 are still thinking of retail price targets. This came as she claimed that Ripple has been thinking about global infrastructures. The pundit highlighted the firm’s moves, including its acquisition of payment and custody infrastructure. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Surge Another 30% If This Trend Is Confirmed Furthermore, XRP Queen noted that Ripple has integrated with banks, funds, and institutions, which she claimed is positioning the altcoin for real-time global settlement. The pundit also believes that the crypto firm has secured regulatory clarity where it actually matters, which is bullish for the XRP price. Lastly, she mentioned that Ripple is actively pursuing a full banking license, having secured conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). XRP Queen declared that Ripple’s moves are how one builds financial plumbing. “Systems don’t move in pennies. They move in orders of magnitude. Lock in,” she added. Regarding how high the XRP price could rise based on institutional targets, XRP Queen suggested the altcoin could reach $100. In an X post, she stated that people laugh at an XRP price target of $100 because they price it like a meme, but that institutions price the altcoin like infrastructure. As such, she believes the altcoin could reach these price targets based on its utility, especially as it gains traction as a token for real-time global settlement. Canary Capital CEO Makes Bullish Case For XRP In a YouTube video, crypto pundit Cheeky Crypto highlighted a statement from Canary Capital’s CEO, Steven McClurg, in which he said that an XRP price target of between $5 and $10 may sound like a lot to a retail trader. However, he believes that these price targets are a rounding error when one considers the trillions of dollars in liquidity required to settle global real-world assets (RWAs) at scale. Related Reading: XRP Wave C Push On The Way: What Could Send Price Below $2? Cheeky Crypto also highlighted McClurg’s statement, in which he said the XRP Ledger is already processing real financial transactions and boasts real-world financial use cases, which he claims are drawing institutions’ attention. Notably, the Canary Capital CEO had recently predicted that XRP would dominate the RWA industry, which is projected to become a trillion-dollar industry at some point. This could boost the altcoin’s utility as the XRP Ledger processes more RWA transactions, sending the XRP price higher in the process. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.95, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Is Dogecoin About To Repeat NVIDIA’s Run? Here’s What The Chart Says",
    "body": "Comparing Dogecoin to NVIDIA may seem illogical at first. One is a speculative digital asset rooted in internet culture, while the other is a leading equity in the AI and tech sector. However, a chart shared by cycle analyst @Cryptollica reframes the comparison by stripping away narrative and focusing on capital flows. Rather than asking which story is more compelling, it examines how money has historically rotated between established market leaders and high‑risk assets as cycles mature. What The Dogecoin—NVIDIA Chart Is Showing Investors The chart posted by Cryptollica tracks the DOGE-to-NVIDIA ratio across multiple market cycles, emphasizing relative performance rather than absolute price. This perspective matters because it highlights where capital has generated the highest marginal returns over time. Historically, the ratio has moved within a clearly defined downward channel, with major turning points occurring when the price reaches the lower boundary of that structure. During both the 2017 and 2021 cycles, the ratio compressed into this same support area. In each case, NVIDIA had already realized significant upside, while Dogecoin remained heavily discounted in relative terms. What followed was not a breakdown in NVIDIA’s price, but a period where Dogecoin significantly outperformed as speculative capital rotated back into higher-risk opportunities. The current structure mirrors those earlier conditions. The ratio is again testing long-term support, signaling a familiar imbalance: extended gains already priced into NVIDIA, and suppressed relative value in Dogecoin. In previous cycles, this setup preceded sharp shifts in relative performance as liquidity began favoring assets with greater upside sensitivity. What A Rotation Environment Means For Dogecoin The pattern highlighted by the chart centers on rotation rather than decline. When leading trades lose momentum, capital typically stays within the market and seeks higher beta exposure. Historically, Dogecoin has benefited during these transitions, serving as a vehicle for speculative flows once dominant growth assets reached saturation. This does not imply weakness in NVIDIA’s underlying fundamentals. Its valuation remains tied to sustained AI-driven growth expectations. Dogecoin, however, operates under a different dynamic, driven largely by sentiment and liquidity conditions. When markets move from concentration into dispersion, assets like DOGE have previously delivered outsized percentage gains. The chart suggests that a similar environment may be forming again. At comparable points in past cycles, Dogecoin outperformed after NVIDIA-like leaders had already completed their primary expansion phase. If the ratio holds its historical support, the data points to a renewed window where DOGE could outperform on a relative basis. Rather than predicting hype-driven rallies, the chart highlights a recurring structural relationship between capital leaders and speculative assets. Whether the pattern repeats will depend on liquidity and risk appetite, but the setup reflects a consistent historical behavior that has appeared more than once across market cycles.

    "title": "XRP Bullish Divergence Shows The Next Direction That Price Is Headed In",
    "body": "XRP might be currently trading in corrections, but technical analysis shows the cryptocurrency is still headed in an upward direction. A recent analysis shared on X by crypto analyst JD frames the pullback as a calculated reset, arguing that the correction fits neatly into a larger setup that may determine XRP’s next major move. The lower the XRP price goes, the higher the breakout will be. Falling Wedge Breakout: The July 2025 Precision Move Technical analysis shared on X by crypto analyst JD shows that XRP’s price action has been following a well-laid-out plan that goes as far back as early 2025. The 3D candlestick price chart shows that XRP spent the first half of 2025 trading inside a falling wedge, a structure that is known for resolving to the upside. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Just Entered Neutral State – What This Means That setup played out cleanly in July 2025, when the XRP price broke above the falling wedge and reached JD’s projected measured target with accuracy. The completion of that measured target led to the start of a correction, which is where the current technical structure comes into focus. After the July breakout, XRP transitioned into a descending broadening wedge characterized by lower lows and lower highs that expand over time. This structure has governed price action since mid-2025 and explains the steady grind lower. JD’s comments reference this phase directly, noting that the recent 23% correction unfolded as he had predicted. With this in mind, the analyst noted that the lower the XRP price goes, the higher the breakout will be. Next Direction For XRP Price The descending broadening wedge on the three-day chart comes with a clear measured projection that outlines where this corrective phase could terminate. As it stands, there’s still a possibility that the XRP price will continue declining to as low as $1.5 before rebounding at the lower trendline of the descending wedge. Related Reading: XRP/Gold Ratio Just Reached A Historical Support Zone, What This Means For Price If the price reaches this projected region and selling pressure weakens as anticipated, the setup favors a sharp reversal higher, consistent with how XRP previously reacted after the falling wedge completed in July 2025. However, it is important to keep in mind that the price doesn’t necessarily have to fall to as low as $1.5 before an upward rebound happens. On the other hand, an eventual break above the upper trendline of the descending wedge is projected by crypto analyst JD to push XRP as high as $4, which would place the cryptocurrency trading at new price highs. The most important thing right now is a close above $2.3 in order to cement this break above the descending wedge. At the same time, on-chain data points to cautiousness in the near term. Data from Glassnode shows that XRP is slipping back into a cost-basis setup similar to what was last observed in February 2022, a trend that might influence sell pressure in the near future.

    "body": "XRP’s next big rise could come with hardly any warning, traders and analysts warn. Markets are quiet now. That quiet has happened before, and it has sometimes been followed by sharp moves that catch most people off guard. Related Reading: Bitcoin Senses Risk As Trump Balks At Europe With Major Tariffs History Of Sudden Moves According to several community analysts, XRP has a pattern of long quiet periods followed by fast spikes. It rarely creeps steadily upward for weeks before a charge. Instead, price often treads water, people lose faith, and then momentum arrives quickly. That behavior has left many short-term traders on the sidelines when runs happen. A move looks obvious only after it is already well under way. Legal Overhang Gone Reports say the SEC lawsuit changed XRP’s timing for years. While other tokens took part in big market swings, XRP traded under heavy regulatory pressure. That pressure is now removed. The major $XRP breakout will come when many least expect it. Its always a “catch-off-guard” move.. but we’re prepared. — 🇬🇧 ChartNerd 📊 (@ChartNerdTA) January 17, 2026 The market has since been allowed to price XRP without that cloud. In late 2024, a notable rally began after US President Donald Trump’s win and the exit of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Momentum pushed XRP from roughly $0.50 to above $3 in a matter of weeks. But the gains were followed by a long reset. Exposure Beats Perfect Timing According to a number of commentators, being already invested matters more than hitting the exact bottom. When the price starts to climb fast, buyers who jump in late often pay too much and panic-sell when the heat fades. Early holders tend to capture most of the upside. Reports note this has repeated across multiple cycles. Emotion drives late entry; calm positioning often wins. At the time of writing, XRP was trading near $1.93, down about 4% on the day and roughly 55% below its recent high. Many who bought above $3 over the past year have cut losses or reduced positions, which has left sentiment thin.

Volume patterns and derivatives flows will matter if price begins to move again. An array of factors could start the run — quick inflows, a shift in macro appetite, or a big buyer showing up. On-chain signs, exchange flows, and futures positioning would give clearer clues, but those signals can flip fast. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

Analyst Forecast Colossal Short Squeeze Ahead After the record date, Trump Media plans to collaborate with Crypto.com to mint the digital tokens, which will be displayed on the blockchain and held in custody until distribution. In addition to the digital tokens, Trump Media has indicated that various rewards will be made available to record-date shareholders throughout the year. These rewards may include benefits or discounts associated with Trump Media’s offerings, such as Truth Social, Truth+, and Truth Predict. CRO Token Plummets The partnership between Crypto.com and Trump Media dates back to August last year, when the Trump-linked company announced a $6.4 billion investment in the crypto exchange’s native token, CRO, as part of a strategic reserve.

Expert Pinpoints On-Chain Triggers For Potential Rally Devin Nunes, Trump Media’s CEO and Chairman, expressed his enthusiasm about the latest move and the partnership with Crypto.com, stating: We look forward to leveraging Crypto.com’s blockchain technology consistent with Securities and Exchange Commission guidance to benefit our shareholders and promote transparency, including by obtaining a clear picture of bona fide beneficial ownership as of the record date. Despite the latest announcement, Crypto.com’s native token failed to capitalize on the news, dropping to $0.089 on Tuesday amid the broader crypto market’s retracement. It has recorded an 11% drop in the past week alone. Featured image from OpenArt, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Whale Panic Fades: Sell Pressure On Binance Falls Off A Cliff",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s exchange-side supply signal is flashing a notable change: whale-sized transfers into Binance have dropped sharply from late-November panic levels, suggesting large holders are no longer leaning on the sell button with the same urgency. Selling Pressure From Bitcoin Whales Fade CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost said current data shows a “clear decline in whale transactions,” specifically BTC inflows to exchanges, meaning “large holders are sending significantly less BTC to trading platforms than before.” In the post, the chart focus was Binance inflows segmented by transaction size, spanning transfers from 100 BTC up to the largest prints above 10,000 BTC, flows that are commonly interpreted as potential sell-side positioning when they hit an exchange. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Down Today? Key Drivers Behind The Move The key backdrop in Darkfost’s thread is how quickly whale behavior shifted around the market’s late-2025 drawdown. “December has been particularly challenging, even for these investors,” the analyst wrote, adding that whales are typically “more cautious” and “less sensitive to market movements than retail participants,” often acting with “greater discipline and patience.” That discipline appeared to crack as Bitcoin rolled over from its latest all-time high near $126,000. Darkfost described a surge in whale inflows to Binance at the end of November as BTC “continued its correction,” with the “average monthly total” reaching “nearly $8 billion” during a period when BTC “fell back below the $90,000 level.” “This phase clearly triggered a panic-driven move,” the post said. “Transactions ranging between 100 and 10,000 BTC increased significantly, especially as price broke below the $85,000 level. This behavior reflects real stress among certain whales, who chose to sell quickly in order to limit losses, thereby reinforcing selling pressure on the market.” The crux is what changed since that cluster. “Today, the situation looks very different,” Darkfost wrote. Those Binance inflows “have been divided by three and now stand at around $2.74 billion,” with “daily movements” becoming “far less frequent than during the cluster observed at the end of November.” Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Really In A Bear Market? Why January 20 Matters The analyst framed the drop as an observable behavioral pivot rather than a single-day anomaly. “This shift in dynamics suggests that whales have changed their behavior,” Darkfost wrote. “They are no longer selling aggressively and now appear to favor waiting.” Institutional Demand Side Remains Robust While Darkfost’s post focuses on whale-associated inflows as a proxy for potential sell pressure, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju pointed investors to the other side of the ledger: institutional accumulation. “Institutional demand for Bitcoin remains strong,” Ki wrote on X. “US custody wallets typically hold 100–1,000 BTC each. Excluding exchanges and miners, this gives a rough read on institutional demand. ETF holdings included.” Ki added that “577K BTC ($53B) [was] added over the past year, and still flowing in,” characterizing the trend as ongoing rather than a completed wave. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $90,885. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Bear Market Depths: A Closer Look At How Low BTC Could Go",
    "body": "On Tuesday, Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below the significant $90,000 mark once again, raising concerns about the possibility of entering a new bear market and casting doubt on the cryptocurrency’s prospects. Market analyst Raun Neuner published a new analysis of the situation in a post on X (formerly Twitter). Is $37,000 On The Horizon? Neuner highlighted that while stocks are performing robustly and commodities are experiencing what he calls a “supercycle,” the crypto market still struggles to gain traction. This situation raises the critical question: What is the worst-case scenario for Bitcoin? Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For $4,000 Breakout? Expert Pinpoints On-Chain Triggers For Potential Rally Historically, Bitcoin’s bull markets tend to peak approximately 532 days after each Halving event. Applying this pattern to the current cycle suggests that Bitcoin could have reached its peak around early October, where it briefly touched $125,000. Historical trends show that following these peaks, Bitcoin typically endures a substantial decline of 70 to 80%. If this framework holds for the current cycle, Neuner estimates a potential downturn to around $37,000 in the event of a full bear market. Zooming out to consider broader traditional market dynamics provides further context. After a year marked by strong performances in both stocks and commodities, market corrections are to be expected. During risk-off periods in equity markets, Bitcoin has historically amplified these downward moves, contributing to building pressure toward the lower end of the spectrum. The analyst indicates that a key reference point for Bitcoin might be around the $57,000 mark, where the 200-week moving average (MA) resides. Critical Bitcoin Support Levels To Watch The immediate factors contributing to Bitcoin’s recent drop below the $90,000 threshold are linked to heightened volatility in global bond and equity markets, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions. Walter Bloomberg, an expert in market analysis, pointed out that the new downtrend has been spurred by various macroeconomic factors, including renewed threats from President Trump regarding tariffs on Greenland and Japan’s fiscal strategies that have added to market instability. Related Reading: Is A New XRP Price Record Imminent? Analyst Forecast Colossal Short Squeeze Ahead Consequently, investors have turned to safe-haven assets like gold, which recently reached a record price exceeding $4,700. In response, Bloomberg warns that macro risks may be underappreciated. Demand for downside protection in Bitcoin’s options market is also rising, indicating that investors are aware of the potential for further declines. The next significant levels for the Bitcoin price in the near term, according to Bloomberg, lie between $84,000 and $85,000, which are expected to act as support for BTC. If the cryptocurrency fails to hold these levels, fears of a deep bear market may become more pronounced. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin IFP Hints At Potential Turnaround: What It Means",
    "body": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Inter-exchange Flow Pulse (IFP) has shown early signs of a turnaround recently, suggesting tokens have started moving into derivatives platforms. Bitcoin IFP Is Turning Around, But Not Yet Inside Bull Market Zone As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin IFP has seemingly hit a bottom recently. The “IFP” is an indicator that measures the amount of BTC that’s flowing between spot and derivatives exchanges. When the value of this metric is rising, it means the investors are making a higher amount of transactions from spot to derivatives platforms. Such a trend suggests speculative interest in the market is going up. Related Reading: $790 Million In Crypto Longs Decimated As Bitcoin Plunges To $93,000 On the other hand, the indicator witnessing a decline implies traders may be pulling back on risk as they are sending a lower number of tokens to derivatives markets. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin IFP, as well as its 90-day moving average (MA), over the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin IFP hit a high in the first quarter of 2025 and reversed course, suggesting speculative activity began to decline. Soon after the start of this downtrend, the metric slipped under its 90-day MA. CryptoQuant considers such a crossover to be a bearish one, labeling periods with the indicator below the 90-day MA to correspond to bear markets or corrections. Interestingly, while the cryptocurrency went on to see rejuvenation of bullish momentum and set a new all-time high (ATH) later in 2025, the market environment leaned bearish from the perspective of the IFP, with the metric’s value holding a steady downward trajectory. Recently, however, the early signs of a shift may have finally emerged, as the IFP has shown a turnaround. This increase in derivatives exchange flows has come for Bitcoin as its price has gone through a recovery surge. For now, though, the indicator is still floating at a notable distance under its 90-day MA. In the past, a break beyond this line has usually led to bullish price action for the cryptocurrency, so such a crossover could potentially be a positive sign this time as well. Whether speculative activity related to the asset will rise enough to overcome this threshold only remains to be seen. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Take Profits: 41,800 BTC Sent To Exchanges Speaking of speculation, the Bitcoin Open Interest, a measure of the amount of BTC positions open on all derivatives exchanges, has surged 3.2% alongside BTC’s pullback in the past day, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has highlighted in an X post. BTC Price Bitcoin has gone through a plunge over the last couple of days that has taken its price from $95,000 to $91,200. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Trove Markets’ new token collapsed almost immediately after trading began, wiping out the vast majority of early gains and leaving many backers angry and confused. The drop was brutal. Traders who bought early watched their holdings shrink by about 95% in a matter of hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Fired Up As Saylor Teases ‘Bigger Orange’ After Huge Buy Token Price Plunges After Launch Initial prices implied a market value near $20 million. Based on reports, the token fell to roughly $0.0008 per unit, trimming the market cap to below $1–2 million. Some wallets unloaded huge chunks of coins right after the token generation event. That selling pressure coincided with a flood of posts on social platforms calling the launch a rug pull. Trove Had Raised Millions Before The Fall According to reports, the project raised roughly $11.5 million in its public sale. The Trove team announced it would keep about $9.4 million to fund further work and pay for a switch of blockchains. Refunds totaling about $2.44 million were returned to some investors, and another $100,000 was earmarked for additional reimbursements. The numbers left many buyers feeling shortchanged and asking why a large share of the money stayed with the team. Team Keeps Majority Of Funds On-chain analysts and tracing tools flagged unusual transfers tied to a handful of new accounts. Reports note that a meaningful slice of the token supply moved into one cluster of wallets, and some transfers were routed through services like ChangeHero. That activity raised questions about whether all token allocations were handled openly. Legal calls and demands for public audits followed soon after. Investors reacted quickly. Some demanded full refunds. Others threatened legal steps. Community moderators and influencers amplified complaints and demanded clear timelines for fixes. We’re pivoting Trove to Solana. After recent sentiment around Trove, the liquidity partner that had been supporting our Hyperliquid path chose to unwind their 500k $HYPE position. That was their decision and we fully respect it. This changes our constraints: we’re no longer… — unwise (@unwisecap) January 18, 2026 Trove posted updates, saying a partner had pulled out and that the pivot to Solana was necessary to keep the project alive. The team promised to continue building and to be more open about their choices, while pledging to deliver a working platform that might justify holding the funds. https://t.co/sc8b59sjYE — TROVE (@TroveMarkets) January 19, 2026 Related Reading: Bitcoin Senses Risk As Trump Balks At Europe With Major Tariffs Trust Hinges On Delivery And Transparency What happens next will matter more than the words now being exchanged. If the team can show tangible progress on the exchange and create real trading depth, some anger may fade. If not, the episode could be used as a warning: token sales that change terms late in the process can trigger swift market punishment and reputational damage. Regulatory scrutiny could also increase if large sums are held after a collapse like this. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Pundit Clarifies XRP Roadmap To $10: How Price Will Play Out In 2026",
    "body": "Although the XRP price has remained in a downtrend and largely range-bound since falling below its 2025 peak, a crypto analyst believes it could still surge to $10 in 2026. The analyst has shared a detailed roadmap supporting this bullish outlook, outlining how XRP’s price could play out this year and the key factors that could influence its movements. A Roadmap To XRP $10 Price Surge In a YouTube video released on January 20, crypto market analyst Zach Rector laid out his honest expectations for XRP’s outlook in 2026, offering insights into how it could get to $10 and the catalysts that could fuel this rally. According to the analyst, the XRP market is currently dominated by Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD), along with signs of capitulation, which have pushed the price down and negatively impacted the sentiment and confidence of newer investors. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin About To Repeat NVIDIA’s Run? Here’s What The Chart Says Rector revealed that long-term XRP holders are also becoming increasingly frustrated with the prolonged downtrend, with many wishing they had taken profits during last year’s rally, particularly when XRP rose to a peak around $3.6. He added that there has also been discontent and negative sentiment regarding XRP’s slow adoption, delay in industry regulation, and more. However, from both a technical and investment standpoint, the analyst said he remains excited and optimistic about XRP’s price prospects in 2026. He explained that the market is already entering a renewed liquidity cycle, a shift that typically leads to an expansion in the broader business cycle. According to him, this stage has always correlated with powerful bull runs during an altcoin season. Rector mentioned that although many investors and analysts expected an altcoin season in 2025, it never came. He believes that market conditions could still align for an altcoin season this year, with XRP positioned for significant gains during that period. He further acknowledged that he does not expect XRP to skyrocket to $50 or $100 in 2026, calling those price targets highly ambitious. For his more realistic projection, Rector said he believes XRP could rise to between $5 and $10 in 2026. He noted that a significant sell wall exists around this range, as many investors are likely to take profits amid potential price volatility. Despite this, the analyst said that XRP still brings a strong ROI opportunity for investors. He pointed to factors that could drive the market, including US interest rate cuts, the implementation of the CLARITY Act, and billions of dollars expected from the Fed’s QE programs. XRP Could Double ROI Faster Than Gold And Silver In his video, Rector compared XRP’s long-term profitability potential to that of gold and silver. He noted that both precious metals performed exceptionally during this cycle, reaching new all-time highs. Silver, in particular, exceeded expectations, breaking past $95 in the last 24 hours after experiencing a years-long downtrend. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales Are On The Move Again, 361 Billion SHIB Stuns Community Rector believes that the chances of silver doubling to $200 or gold reaching $9,000-$10,000 per ounce this year are low. However, he says XRP has much stronger upside potential, forecasting a surge to $4 and beyond. If this happens, long-term investors who bought at or below $2 could effectively double their ROI.

    "title": "Solana Will Become A ‘Decentralized Nasdaq’ In 2026, Delphi Digital Predicts",
    "body": "Delphi Digital is betting that Solana’s next major upgrade cycle will reposition the network as an “exchange grade” environment capable of supporting onchain order books that can realistically contend with centralized venues on latency, liquidity depth, and market structure. In a Jan. 20 post on X titled “2026 is the Year of Solana”, the research firm argued Solana’s 2026 roadmap is its “most aggressive upgrade cycle” yet, one that “overhaul[s] everything from consensus to infrastructure to become the decentralized Nasdaq.” Why Delphi Digital Calls 2026 “The Year Of Solana” Delphi framed the roadmap less as a grab bag of performance enhancements and more as a capital-markets push: “Solana’s roadmap is about transforming it into an exchange grade environment where a native onchain CLOB can viably compete with CEX latency, liquidity depth, and fairness. Here are all the upgrades making this possible.” In that view, shaving milliseconds matters only insofar as it produces predictable, enforceable execution outcomes for applications like high-frequency trading and central limit order books. The centerpiece, Delphi wrote, is Alpenglow, a consensus redesign it called “the most significant protocol level change in Solana’s history.” The firm said Alpenglow introduces a new architecture built around Votor and Rotor, with Votor changing how validators reach agreement. Rather than “chaining multiple voting rounds together,” validators would aggregate votes offchain and “commit to finality in one or two rounds,” producing “theoretical finality in the 100-150 millisecond range, down from the original 12.8 seconds.” Related Reading: Solana At Risk Of Breakdown After Key Rejection – Is $100 Next? Delphi emphasized Votor’s parallel finalization paths as a resilience feature, not just a speed play. If a block gets “overwhelming support (80%+ stake)” it finalizes immediately; if support is between 60% and 80%, a second round triggers, and finality follows if that also clears 60%. The goal, Delphi argued, is to preserve finality even with unresponsive segments of the network. Alpenglow also introduces what Delphi called a “20+20” resilience model: safety holds as long as no more than 20% of stake is malicious, while liveness persists even if another 20% is offline, “tolerat[ing] up to 40% of the network being either malicious or inactive while still maintaining finality.” Under this design, Proof of History is “effectively deprecated,” replaced by deterministic slot scheduling and local timers. Delphi said the upgrade is expected to roll out in early to mid 2026. Delphi also pointed to Firedancer, Jump’s C++ validator client, as a structural upgrade aimed at reducing a long-standing operational risk. Solana has historically relied on a single client, now known as Agave, and Delphi described that “monoculture” as a central weakness because client-level faults can cascade into broader network halts. Firedancer’s objective, Delphi said, is a deterministic, high-throughput engine that can process “millions of TPS with minimal latency variance.” Ahead of full readiness, Delphi highlighted “Frankendancer,” a transitional build that combines Firedancer’s networking and block production modules with Agave’s runtime and consensus components, as a bridge to “substantially” increased client diversity. On infrastructure, Delphi spotlighted DoubleZero as a private fiber overlay for validators, likening its transmission profile to traditional exchange connectivity: “the same infrastructure traditional exchanges like Nasdaq and CME rely on for microsecond level transmission.” The argument is that as validator sets expand, propagation variance becomes the enemy of tight finality windows. By routing messages along “optimal paths” and supporting multicast delivery, Delphi said DoubleZero can narrow latency gaps across validators—an enabler for both Votor’s quorum formation and Rotor’s propagation design. Related Reading: SOL Price Faces Key Support Amid Solana’s Rapid Network Expansion Delphi also framed Solana’s block-building roadmap as a market-structure project. It described Jito’s BAM (Block Assembly Marketplace) as separating ordering from execution via a marketplace and privacy layer, with transactions ingested into TEEs so “neither validators nor builders can see raw transaction content before ordering takes effect,” reducing pre-execution behavior like frontrunning. Harmonic, meanwhile, targets builder competition by introducing an open aggregation layer so validators can accept proposals from “multiple competing builders in real time,” with Delphi summarizing: “Think of Harmonic as a meta-market and BAM as a micro-market.” Raiku rounds out the thesis by adding deterministic latency and programmable execution guarantees adjacent to Solana’s validator set, using Ahead-of-Time (AOT) transactions for pre-committed workflows and Just-in-Time (JIT) transactions for real-time needs—without modifying L1 consensus. Delphi ultimately tied the technical roadmap to market demand: Solana’s spot trading gravity, the consolidation of onchain perps toward a handful of venues, and the need to reach performance parity with centralized platforms. It cited expectations for “new Solana native perps like Bulk Trade coming early next year,” and pointed to products like xStocks bringing “onchain equities directly to Solana,” arguing that liquidity and attention are consolidating toward a chain with faster settlement, better UX, and denser capital. At press time, SOL traded at $127. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",
