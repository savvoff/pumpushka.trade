    "title": "What Does XRP Really Do? Expert Explains What It Is Built For",
    "body": "Crypto analyst and XRP advocate Levi Rietveld recently shared a short post on X stating that “$XRP is built for this,” alongside a video clip of US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaking about reviewing regulatory barriers around blockchain, stablecoins, and new payment systems like the crypto industry. Bessent’s comments focused on reforming financial infrastructure so capital markets can function more efficiently for mainstream users. In turn, Rietveld viewed those comments as closely matching the original purpose XRP was created to serve. Related Reading: Ethereum’s 2026 Overhaul Aims To Cut Costs, Boost Speed, Limit Censorship What XRP Was Designed To Do In the video clip that Levi Rietveld shared on X alongside his statement of XRP being built for this, Scott Bessent outlined a policy direction that places emphasis on evaluating regulatory impediments to blockchain technology, stablecoins, and new payment systems. Bessent stated that officials will take a close look at regulatory impediments to blockchain, stablecoins, and new payment systems and consider reforms to unleash the power of American capital markets. Notably, this plan corresponds to a more crypto-positive approach adopted by the current US administration under President Donald Trump. $XRP Is Built For This! pic.twitter.com/WNDUoeFPC4 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 22, 2025 These are a part of efforts by the US government to modernize crypto regulation and define clearer frameworks for digital assets, including proposed acts aimed at bringing clarity to markets and stablecoins. One example of this is the Clarity Act, a legislative proposal that aims to clearly define the regulatory treatment of digital assets, separate payment-focused tokens from securities, and assign clearer oversight roles to agencies such as the SEC and CFTC. Bessent’s comments focused on improving payment systems and removing friction around new financial technology. XRP proponents like Levi Rietveld would quickly point out that the theme aligns closely with how the cryptocurrency and the XRP Ledger were engineered. The XRP Ledger works with transparent settlement, predictable transaction costs, and finality that does not depend on mining or complex smart contract execution. These characteristics are important for institutions that need clarity and reliability. In practice, XRP’s real-world role is most visible through payment solutions developed by Ripple. Banks and other financial institutions do not need to hold large balances of foreign currencies, since XRP can be used as an intermediate asset during settlement. XRP’s Current Regulatory And Institutional Position Progress on regulatory clarity has been helping real institutional infrastructure around XRP. Multiple Spot XRP ETFs have gained approval and launched in 2025 and early numbers are positive, with over $1.14 billion worth of inflows. Bloomberg estimates suggest these funds could draw $5 billion to $7 billion in institutional capital by 2026. Related Reading: Could XRP Make Trillionaires?

All these cannot be possible without the clear framework for blockchain, stable coins, and new payment systems proposed by Bessent. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Sees Unusual Short-Term Supply Spike, Raising Bearish Flags",
    "body": "Since the short squeeze in mid-December, Bitcoin has yet to make any significant price gain, facing multiple rejections at the $90,000 price zone. The maiden cryptocurrency is presently consolidating within the $87,000, while investors patiently anticipate a clear market direction. According to pseudonymous analyst Sunny Mom, recent on-chain analysis suggests that bearish sentiment will remain dominant in the coming months following the initial extended correction in October and November. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle Is Dead: Crypto Trader Explains What Happens Next Why Rising Short-Term Bitcoin Supply Is Flashing A Rare Bearish Signal In a QuickTake post on December 27, Sunny Mom draws attention to the BTC HODL waves, which show the rising share of short-term holders coinciding with falling prices, flipping a metric that typically supports bullish narratives. Historically, an increase in short-term holder (STH) supply, coins held for less than 155 days, suggests fresh capital is entering the market ahead of sustained rallies. However, the analyst described the current move as “passive bag-holding” rather than signaling “new blood.” This is because investors who bought during the $120,000 rally in October, driven by FOMO, alongside dip buyers in November, now sit on unrealized losses, thereby creating a price setup that alters market behavior. Sunny Mom explains that each relief rally is met with selling pressure as these holders attempt to exit at breakeven, effectively turning the expanding STH cohort into a ceiling rather than a floor. Therefore, price rebounds struggle to gain traction. The renowned analyst explains that the market is witnessing an emotional toll that is growing visibly on-chain. Notably, there have been repeated spikes in Net Realized Loss (NRL) since October liquidations, suggesting that capitulation is underway, with investors locking in losses after months of endurance. Sunny Mom describes the process as a “dull knife” finally cutting deep, an indication that weaker hands are being forced out, not through a single crash, but through prolonged exhaustion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Face Prolonged Pain As Key Metric Stays Red Bitcoin In Demand Vacuum As Likely Fall Below $80,000 Remains Active In further analysis, Mom attributes the current bearish setup to a demand vacuum. The market expert explains that exchange reserves are sitting near multi-year lows, signaling limited immediate sell-side liquidity. At the same time, long-term holders (LTHs) show little interest in distributing coins, reinforcing the view that conviction capital remains intact. Therefore, the problem lies on the demand side. With macro uncertainty still elevated, new buyers appear hesitant to step in, creating a demand vacuum. This also creates thin order books, meaning even modest sell pressure can push prices sharply lower. While some market watchers target a potential recovery in Q1 2026, citing expectations of rate cuts and improved global liquidity. Mom predicts Bitcoin may need a “final shakeout” to resolve the imbalance and reset the market for a bullish breakout. The analyst points to a potential move below $80,000 as a liquidity hunt that could flush remaining weak hands and allow larger holders to reaccumulate.

    "title": "Here’s When Bitcoin Super Cycle Will Kick In  — Analyst",
    "body": "Popular market analyst KillaXBT has shared a bold prediction of a Bitcoin super cycle. After multiple failed “super cycle” calls by other market enthusiasts, the anonymous market expert argues that Bitcoin’s defining breakout has yet to begin, highlighting a key market condition. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Face Prolonged Pain As Key Metric Stays Red Metal Market Downtrend, Bitcoin Supertrend According to KillaXBT in an X post on December 27, the real super cycle will only emerge when capital decisively rotates away from precious metals and into Bitcoin, marking a generational shift rather than a typical crypto rally. Unlike past “premature” super-cycle narratives, driven more by optimism, the analyst references a budding price structure similarity that indicates a massive Bitcoin price rally ahead. Notably, interest in precious metals is soaring after gold and silver recently reached new ATH prices of $4,500 and $77, respectively. Similar to most analysts, KillaXBT anticipates these precious metals will eventually slip into a multi-year downtrend that will force investors to explore other havens against inflation. In particular, the analyst expects older generations to remain anchored in gold, while a new cohort of capital increasingly chooses Bitcoin as its preferred store of value. As metals underperform, a scarce Bitcoin is tipped to record an unprecedented demand. The analyst draws a historical parallel between gold in early 1972 and Bitcoin’s current position heading into 2027. In this period, Gold entered a powerful multi-year run as capital sought protection from inflation and currency debasement. KillaXBT argues Bitcoin is approaching a similar inflection point and is set to outperform every major asset class in the next cycle. Interestingly, gold, long considered the ultimate store of value, is currently valued at an estimated $31.7 trillion in market cap value. Bitcoin, by contrast, sits near $1.83 trillion. KillaXBT explains that even at a Bitcoin price of $200,000, the network’s market cap would rise to roughly $5 trillion, still about six times smaller than gold, highlighting how early Bitcoin remains in the global asset hierarchy. Related Reading: Ethereum Investors Slide Deeper Into Losses – What The Drop Below $3,000 Means This Is The Last Sub $100,000 Bear Market – Analyst In concluding notes, KillaXBT states that skepticism has accompanied every major Bitcoin rally, consistently peaking just before large upside moves. In past cycles, critics pointed to regulation, environmental concerns, and volatility risks. Today, the fear narrative has shifted to emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. The analyst suggests that these concerns may once again pressure investors out of the market prematurely. However, KillaXBT is taking a bullish stance as they believe the current phase could represent the final prolonged bear market in which Bitcoin trades below $100,000. However, they warn that investors should expect the supercycle boom in 2027, as 2026 is likely to be a bearish period. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from Tradingview",

    "title": "XRP Supply Dwindles While ETFs Go On A Buying Spree Before 2026",
    "body": "XRP is slowly entering one of the most important structural phases in its history. Price action has been mostly bearish and sentiment across the broader crypto market has been cautious, but on-chain data tells a very different story. Data from Glassnode shows XRP balances on centralized exchanges falling to around 1.5 billion XRP, their lowest in over a year. This trend is unfolding alongside accumulation from newly launched XRP ETFs, creating conditions that could change the altcoin’s price dynamics heading into 2026. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forecasts For 2026 Range From $65K To $250K As Sentiment Hits ‘Extreme Fear’ XRP Exchange Balances Fall To Multi-Year Lows Data from Glassnode’s XRP balance on exchanges metric points to a clear and persistent downtrend in balances held on crypto exchanges throughout 2025. Earlier in the year, about 4 billion XRP sat on centralized platforms. Since then, balances have steadily declined, with a particularly sharp drop visible in the fourth quarter of the year. As it stands, exchange-held XRP has compressed toward the 1.5 billion mark, one of the lowest levels recorded in recent years. This decline has occurred despite the current downtrend in XRP’s price action, meaning that some holders are increasingly opting to move tokens into longer-term custody, even as some others are selling off their holdings. This trend is important for bullish momentum, as falling exchange balances reduce near-term sell pressure and make cryptocurrencies more sensitive to incoming demand. At the center of this supply contraction are US-based Spot XRP ETFs, which have risen as a powerful new source of demand. Market estimates indicate that about 750 million XRP have been absorbed by the six Spot ETF products since the first one launched in November. As ETFs continue pulling XRP off exchanges, the pool of liquid supply available to the spot market keeps shrinking. This dynamic does not force an immediate price response, but it changes the balance between supply and demand, and we could start to see the effects on the crypto in 2026. Related Reading: Big Bet On Ethereum: CEO Sees 10X TVL Growth In 2026 Weekly Chart Points To Exhaustion As XRP Sits On Support While on-chain data highlights tightening supply, technical conditions are beginning to reflect a similar theme. Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto recently pointed out that XRP is now sitting on an important horizontal support zone on the weekly timeframe. The chart shows XRP’s price action is now compressing into the $1.90 to $2.00 range after an extended decline from mid-2025 highs near $3.50, placing XRP back at a level that previously acted as a launch point earlier in the cycle. Furthermore, the weekly Stochastic RSI is now in extreme oversold territory and this means that selling pressure has already done much of its work. Steph’s analysis noted that turning points tend to form when downside momentum is exhausted and there is little energy left for sellers to continue pushing price lower. Based on this, traders can expect XRP to transition into bullish momentum in early 2026. Featured image from Gemini, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Analyst Says XRP Price On The Verge Of Bearish Breakdown",
    "body": "The XRP price has been bearish all through December, with key support zones failing to hold through the growing sell pressure. While the altcoin hovers around the $1.80 price level, recent on-chain evaluation shows that the XRP price could be in a precarious situation. Bearish Divergence Materializes Between RSI And XRP Price In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, market analyst CryptoOnchain highlighted that there is a convergence of both technical and on-chain events, which reveal an imminent bearish phase for the XRP price. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Addresses ADA Dump Rumors, Is He Behind The 80% Price Crash? The analyst first pointed out that the XRP price is painting an unsettling picture on its weekly chart, basing this hypothesis on the technical context. While the XRP price hovers near recent highs, indicating intentions to recover previous levels, its momentum tells a contrasting story. CryptoOnchain explained that a bearish divergence has formed between the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the XRP price. So, as the XRP price appears to target recent highs, the RSI has taken on a clear downturn, creating lower highs progressively. Usually, this type of divergence indicates weakening buying strength and dwindling momentum. Interestingly, historical data reveal that this pattern has often preceded significant price corrections. At the same time, the XRP price happens to be retesting the psychological and technical key level at $1.80. The market quant explained that in the event that $1.80 fails to hold, the altcoin could quickly see the beginning of an unbridled dump. Looking at the broader technical context, it becomes apparent that any significant upside attempt depends on improving momentum. Open Interest On Binance Cascades To New Low CryptoOnchain also cites a shocking development underneath the surface. The relevant indicator here is the Open Interest, which tracks the total value of all outstanding XRP derivatives contracts (on Binance) that have yet to be closed, settled, or liquidated at a given time. XRP’s open interest recently fell to as low as $450 million, a point marking the lowest level since November 2024. A sharp decrease in Open Interest typically points out that there’s been a significant efflux of leveraged capital from the futures market. Related Reading: XRP Stochastic RSI Just Touched 0.0 For The Second Time In History This kind of unchecked contraction suggests that XRP traders are either forcefully exiting the market or abandoning their positions out of fear. Moreover, the decline in Open Interest alongside weakening price momentum paints a narrative on investor interest; it shows that market participants are stepping back due to a lack of conviction, rather than positioning for upward continuation. With these signals converging to expose a strong bearish scenario for XRP, market participants are advised to act with caution, as the $1.80 key level’s defeat could mean serious trouble for the token’s price. As of this writing, XRP is valued at approximately $1.87, with a 1.5% price jump in the past 24 hours. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView",
