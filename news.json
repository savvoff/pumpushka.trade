    "title": "Bitcoin Flashes Near-Identical Fractal Before The 2021 Bull Run Started",
    "body": "Bitcoin may be replaying a market structure that historically preceded one of its most powerful rallies. A high-timeframe trader has identified a fractal that closely mirrored Bitcoin’s behavior ahead of the 2021 bull run. He argues that the current cycle is unfolding in line with a well-established structural script observed across multiple market cycles spanning more than a decade. Bitcoin’s Fractal: Rooted In High-Timeframe Structure The fractal highlighted by the trader is based on a direct structural comparison between Bitcoin’s current cycle and the 2021 setup, illustrated in a chart he attached to his analysis. The chart aligns both periods to show how price advanced into a broad distribution range, rolled over into a sharp corrective phase, and then attempted to recover while capped by descending resistance. In both cases, Bitcoin retraced to the 0.382 Fibonacci level before stabilizing, marking a shared technical inflection point rather than a coincidental price overlap. Related Reading: XRP Price Is Approaching A Key Decision Zone, But Structure Is Still Firmly Bullish This structural symmetry extends beyond price levels into timing. According to the trader, the current cycle has tracked the rhythm of prior four-year cycles with notable consistency, allowing historical all-time highs and lows to be mapped objectively. Using that same framework, the data previously supported a high-probability short near the peak candle around $123,000, reinforcing his view that recurring market structure continues to guide directional risk. By comparing the two cycles directly, the trader argues that Bitcoin’s behavior is being evaluated through a recurring structural pattern that has remained intact for more than 12 years, rather than through subjective bias. $100,000 As A Structural And Psychological Ceiling Within the identified fractal, psychological resistance is a key determinant of Bitcoin’s upside potential. Looking back at 2021, Bitcoin failed to decisively reclaim the $50,000 level and instead front-ran it before reversing, establishing a behavioral precedent for how traders respond to significant round-number thresholds. Applying this pattern to the current cycle, $100,000 now functions as the analogous psychological ceiling. As a result, some participants may act preemptively, which could generate selling pressure from underwater holders and distribution by larger players. Related Reading: Pundit Reveals The Biggest Enemy Of XRP Investors As Price Struggles At $2 This potential resistance is reinforced by diagonal trendlines that mirror the caps observed in 2021, creating a structural limit on upside momentum. Within this context, short-term extensions into the $98,000–$99,000 range remain plausible and are fully compatible with the fractal, as price can approach the psychological ceiling. Moreover, positioning data from the past six to eight months indicates that the median short-term buyer cost basis has clustered between $95,000 and $100,000, highlighting zones where profit-taking and defensive selling are likely to intensify. These elements suggest a scenario where price may test resistance, experience temporary stalls, and respect structural limits without invalidating the broader high-timeframe thesis. However, the trader notes that the framework is probabilistic: only a sustained move above $104,000–$105,000 would break the fractal pattern and necessitate a full reassessment of the high-timeframe trend.

    "title": "XRP To Repeat Its 2017 Playbook? Analyst Forecasts 1,250% Expansion",
    "body": "While XRP retests a crucial support area, some analysts have suggested that the altcoin is preparing for a massive expansion in the coming months, as a potential trend reversal begins to form and its 2017 formula repeats. Related Reading: CME Group To Launch Cardano, Chainlink, Stellar Futures Amid Crypto Lineup Expansion – Details XRP Gears Up For Massive Expansion On Friday, XRP reached a 12-day low, falling to the $2.02 area before bouncing. Notably, the cryptocurrency has been trading within the $2.05-$2.35 area for nearly two weeks, moving between the mid and lower zones of this price range for most of this period. Amid its recent performance, Sjuul from AltCryptoGems noted that the altcoin “is starting to look better, especially after that bullish market structure break with a fresh higher high.” The analyst highlighted that the cryptocurrency has been consistently trending lower since August, exclusively printing lower lows and lower highs. However, it has broken out of this structure and recorded a higher high for the first time in months after the start-of-the-year rally, setting the stage for a potential reversal. “Now, we have to maintain this bullish structure at any cost and form a higher low on the next dip,” Sjuul warned. Meanwhile, market observer ChartNerd pointed to a striking similarity between XRP’s 2017 playbook and its current performance. In an X post, the analyst affirmed that the altcoin is repeating its 2016-2017 formula, which led to a massive rally toward its previous all-time high (ATH). At the time, XRP saw a textbook multi-year symmetrical triangle formation breakout, followed by a multi-month ABC consolidation before its 1,500% mark-up. This time, the cryptocurrency has repeated a similar symmetrical triangle pattern breakout, and it is currently in Wave C of its ABC consolidation period. To the analyst, a deeper Wave C retracement is possible if the multi-month $1.80 support is lost. Nonetheless, he added that “cycle formula repetition signals XRP is gearing up for expansion towards $8/$13/$27,” which would be a 300%-1,250% increase from the current levels. Q1 Close To Define XRP’s Future Despite his bullish forecast, ChartNerd also shared an important warning for the next two months. According to the analyst, “XRP has just over 2 months to invalidate this 3M bearish Heikin-Ashi candle formation,” or it will risk a massive correction. In a video analysis, he explained that, in the past, whenever the altcoin saw massive rallies followed by a red bearish candle on the three-month timeframe, it would “normally indicate the start of a downtrend or a macro consolidation period.” In 2014, XRP saw a bearish candle print in the three-month timeframe after a remarkable pump, which was followed by a correction and consolidation “for quite a couple of years,” he explained. “The same happened again in 2018. We had this massive rally for XRP, and as soon as we printed a three-month bearish candle in the Heikin-Ashi Candle formation, (…) we entered into the bear market,” ChartNerd continued. Related Reading: Analyst Says It’s Time For Ethereum’s ‘Big Test’ – Is ETH Season Loading? Similarly, the cryptocurrency repeated the same performance in 2021. Now, XRP is starting to form a red candle in this timeframe and has approximately 2 months and 16 days to close the quarter on a positive note. “We have until March before this candle closes. (…) So, what we don’t want to see is this full-bodied three-month Heikin-Ashi Candle, because if we see it, this is where we are likely to see a deeper correction for the next six to nine and even 12 months,” the analyst concluded. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $2.05, a 1.7% decline in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Surge In XRP Transactions: 1.45 Million Daily Users Could Signal Price Rally Ahead, Says Expert",
    "body": "Recent reports indicate that XRP has reached an almost six-month high in daily transactions, marking a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency as it exhibits increasing adoption across both payment systems and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. For January 2026 alone, the XRP Ledger recorded 1.45 million daily transactions, following a steady upward trend in network usage that began in late 2025, coinciding with the introduction of new payment corridors through Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity platform and the integration of stablecoins such as RLUSD. Gaps Between XRP Demand And Price Market expert Sam Daodu highlighted in a recent report for 24/7 Wall St. that historical trends suggest that gaps between rising demand and stagnant prices often precede sharp rallies. With exchange reserves at eight-year lows and increasing institutional inflows seen with XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the current situation indicates that the altcoin may be quietly gearing up for its next breakout. Related Reading: XRP Will Skyrocket Beyond $18: Analyst Suggests 800% Growth Potential In 2026 Despite a slight rebound to $2.42 on January 6, which represented a nearly two-month high for the token, its price has since retraced to approximately $2.048 at the time of writing. This decline occurred despite the transaction surge, suggesting that XRP has yet to capitalize on its increased usage. Daodu noted that the discrepancy between XRP’s price and its on-chain activity isn’t unusual. He asserts that such gaps between usage and price have often been precursors to significant price movements, while also pointing out several factors contributing to the current delay in price reaction. Market-wide consolidation is one of the key reasons, as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) traded sideways in early 2026, dampening momentum for altcoins like XRP. In addition, profit-taking pressure has emerged following XRP’s July 2025 rally up to $3.65. Many short-term holders have cashed out, creating strong resistance levels in the $2.20 to $2.50 range. Until new catalysts arise, Daodu claims XRP may remain confined to this range without breaking out. Is A Major Price Breakout Ahead? Looking forward, Daodu posits that XRP has a historical tendency to lag behind its on-chain progress before initiating explosive price moves. In both 2017 and 2020, spikes in transaction volume and wallet activity preceded significant rallies for the token’s price by several weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Crypto ETFs Set To Attract $130 Billion-Plus Inflows This Year, JPMorgan Predicts For instance, in the third quarter of 2020, XRP’s daily transactions grew by over 40% in just two months, while the price remained flat at around $0.25, only to surge to over $0.70 within weeks in November. A similar scenario unfolded in late 2017, where heightened usage metrics preceded a jump in XRP’s price from $0.30 to $3.30 by early January 2018. This suggests that the current surge in on-chain transactions could be a leading indicator of a delayed price breakout for XRP. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "The Dogecoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) is said to have entered historical oversold levels. This has raised the possibility that the foremost meme coin could repeat its parabolic rally in the 2021 bull cycle. Dogecoin Eyes Parabolic Rally As RSI Enters Oversold Levels Crypto analyst Cryptollica has indicated that the Dogecoin price could record another parabolic rally as the RSI enters oversold levels. In an X post, the analyst noted that this is the fourth time in 12 years that the DOGE RSI has been this oversold, and that every time this has happened, it has been life-changing. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Is Following This Bullish Signal With A Major Target Cryptollica further remarked that the drop in Dogecoin’s RSI to this low has always been an “epic buying opportunity” and that those who loaded up made insane gains. In line with this, the analyst remarked that this is another massive opportunity. Meanwhile, Cryptollica alluded to previous times when the RSI dropped this low, including during the last cycle bottom, when DOGE dropped to $0.5. Dogecoin rallied to a new all-time high (ATH) of $0.74 after bottoming at $0.05, recording massive gains in the process. Cryptollica noted that these setups don’t come often and urged market participants not to miss this one. His accompanying chart suggested that DOGE could rally to the psychological $1 level this time around, marking a new ATH for the foremost meme coin. DOGE Mirroring Past Accumulation Pattern In another X post, Cryptollica highlighted a similar DOGE/BTC pattern between the 2014-2017 and 2021-2026 accumulations. The analyst stated that the structure is identical and assured that the bleed against Bitcoin is not “death” but the necessary energy compression before the rotation. Cryptollica added that when the green line breaks, risk appetite changes instantly. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On The Brink Of A 9,000% Rally To $10? What Historical Performance Shows Meanwhile, Cryptollica declared that the fractal was loading, with Dogecoin set to be the heartbeat of the altcoin cycle. The analyst claimed that this is the final stage of a multi-year compression against Bitcoin. This historically leads to a specific volatility squeeze that precedes a massive capital rotation from BTC to altcoins. Crypto analyst Bitcoinsensus raised the possibility of a Dogecoin rally to $0.70, which could be near. This came as the analyst noted that DOGE has been moving in a nice way up throughout this entire bull cycle. This is said to be evident in the mini cycles, with the foremost meme coin tapping the dotted line, followed by a slow retrace. Based on this pattern, Bitcoinensus noted that DOGE could soon target the $0.70 range if the strong momentum in the crypto market returns. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.137, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Are XRP ETFs About To Act Like Banks? Expert Thinks So",
    "body": "US Senate debate over a bill called the Clarity Act has reignited discussion about XRP and other crypto products, and how they might be treated under US rules. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record Levels As Buterin Urges Builders To Deliver Real Apps Reports have disclosed that the bill could give clearer status to tokens that back US-listed ETFs, moving them closer to commodity-style treatment. XRP spot ETFs have also drawn large capital, with inflows reaching about $1.37 billion since their November 2025 launch — a figure that underlines why lawmakers and market watchers are paying attention. How It Works Creation and redemption in ETFs can happen “in kind,” which means the fund can accept the actual asset instead of cash. That mechanism is real, but it does not let ordinary buyers load tokens directly into a fund. Authorized participants — big broker-dealers and market makers — are the ones that hand tokens to ETFs and receive shares back. Everyday investors buy or sell ETF shares on exchanges. That gap is central to the debate about whether an ETF could ever function like a bank. The XRP ETF’s are also In-Kind Funds, so you can deposit XRP directly into the fund in exchange for the exact value in shares. Most in general will choose this option post law. There are many advantages to this, you will be able to use the ETF like a “bank”. https://t.co/2G49kxUpGc pic.twitter.com/4fyeOkEYTC — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) January 13, 2026 What Community Voices Are Saying According to posts from XRP community figures, some see a future where ETFs act like a regulated parking spot for token holders. Chad Steingraber has been vocal about in-kind mechanics, arguing that investors could swap XRP for matching ETF shares and treat the funds as a safer place to hold value until they need to move tokens again. Those comments have helped popularize the idea that ETFs could be used in a bank-like way. What Taxes Might Look Like Reports and investor guides show that ETF structure matters for taxes. ETFs often use in-kind creation and redemption to avoid routine capital gains distributions at the fund level, which helps make ETFs tax-efficient in many cases. But tax consequences for token holders depend on how transactions are carried out and on the product’s legal structure. Under current US rules, transfers that change the form of an asset can create taxable events for the person handing over the asset, and fund-level distributions can still produce tax bills for investors.

Investors, Steingraber believes, may favor ETFs once the Clarity Act clarifies rules. The appeal is not the technical steps but the confidence of holding XRP in a regulated, organized product. For him, ETFs offer a safer way to manage tokens while still keeping access to them when needed. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Finally Flips Positive — Why This Shift Matters",
    "body": "The price of Bitcoin began the new week on an exciting move to the upside. The premier cryptocurrency recorded a price ascent of about 9%, reaching a high of over $97,000 and falling just short of its past six-figure valuation. Interestingly, a recent on-chain revelation shows that an underlying change was simultaneously taking place as the price of Bitcoin soared on the charts. Are The BTC Bulls Back In Control? In a January 16 post on social media platform X, crypto analyst Darkfost revealed a notable shift in the on-chain power dynamics, saying that the bulls are seemingly back in control. The relevant indicator here is the BTC Net Taker Volume, which tracks which of the buyers or sellers is more aggressive in the market. The metric does so by measuring the net difference between buy and sell market orders executed on derivatives exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Free From The Current Range — $107,000 Now The Level To Watch Before this recent shift, the net taker volume had fallen into deep negative territory, reaching a bottom of about –$489 million. Due to the lack of demand in the market over that period, the price of BTC continued to fall as selling pressure grew. However, this market scenario has shifted, as of Friday, January 16th. The Bitcoin Net Taker Volume now records a positive reading, with more than $39 million in buy-side volume from the futures market. This means BTC traders are becoming increasingly interested in opening long positions — and aggressively at that. Historically, an increasing buying interest among participants of the futures market typically signals rising bullish sentiment. In turn, upward price pressure increases through leverage, leading to amplified short-term price moves if sustained. Bitcoin Market Outlook Darkfost further explained that, although there are signs that Bitcoin ETF inflows might be picking up slightly, it remains that spot buying is yet to gain enough strength to sponsor a decisive bullish move. As a result, all eyes fall on derivatives activity, as it currently serves as support for the Bitcoin price. Ultimately, the present scenario is best interpreted as the end of bearish pressure, rather than a blatant structure shift. However, in the event that net taker volume continues to grow positively, the narrative could shift from dwindling bearish pressure to mounting bullish momentum. Till then, market participants are advised to deal cautiously until it is confirmed that the derivatives-sponsored momentum is sustainable for the flagship cryptocurrency’s growth. As of press time, the price of Bitcoin stands at about $95,357, with insignificant movement over the past day.

    "title": "AVAX Pushes Toward $18 As Key Resistance Looms: Analyst",
    "body": "AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche protocol, is ready for a potential price breakout following another week of significant mixed price action. In line with the widespread crypto market uplift, the altcoin had initially surged as high as $14.85 before retracing below the $13.50 price. According to analyst Ali Martinez, AVAX now lies at another critical price juncture, with the next price move likely to determine its short-term trend. Related Reading: SUI Reclaims Smart Money Zone, While Weekly Structure Signals Big Move Ahead Here’s Why AVAX Must Clear $14.83 Resistance In an X post on January 16, Martinez shares an insightful analysis of the AVAX 12-hour trading chart, identifying a key price zone and an important chart formation. According to the presented technical review, AVAX’s recent rejection around $14.85 can be attributed to heavy resistance in this region. Most notably, the altcoin has struggled to break past this $14.83 price barrier thrice in the last month, indicating a significant willingness among investors to sell when the price approaches this zone. This could be driven by a general view of such a price point as a good profit-taking zone or expectation of a price decline based on historical data. It’s worth noting that Martinez’s analysis also shows that AVAX price movement has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, thereby favoring an imminent upside breakout. For context, the inverse H&S formation is a bullish pattern that signals a potential trend reversal. As seen above, it consists of three troughs: the left shoulder, where price declines, then rebounds; the head, a deeper decline to around $11.26 followed by a recovery, and the right shoulder, a higher low ($13.75) that fails to reach the depth of the head. All rebound highs are connected by a resistance line ($14.83) known as the neckline. And a bullish breakout indicates strengthening buying pressure. Therefore, Martinez explains that AVAX must push past this barrier in a decisive manner to trigger a bullish breakout towards $17.59 as an initial price target. With sustained buying pressure, the analyst predicts a further rise to $18.41, representing a potential 35% gain on present market prices.

    "title": "Ethereum Maintains Structural Strength Despite Resistance Near $3,400",
    "body": "Ethereum continues to show resilience, holding its ground above key support levels even as price faces firm resistance near the $3,400 zone. The ability to sustain strength after recent gains highlights improving market structure, suggesting that buyers remain in control. As long as ETH stays supported above its critical trend levels, the broader upside narrative remains intact despite near-term hesitation. Daily Bull Market Support Band Holds As Key Reversal Zone Luca, in a recent ETH update shared on X, pointed out that Ethereum’s market structure has strengthened considerably over the past several days. The price has been able to hold above the 1D Bull Market Support Band, a level that has acted as a reliable reversal zone multiple times over the last couple of months. This sustained hold suggests improving market confidence and a reduction in immediate downside risk. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Pushes Toward Breakout Levels, Bulls Smell Opportunity Alongside this structural improvement, ETH successfully reclaimed the 0.618 Fibonacci point of interest around the $3,100 region. This level is often viewed as a critical threshold in corrective phases, and holding above it typically signals that buyers are gaining the upper hand. Despite the positive developments, Ethereum has not moved higher without hesitation. ETH’s price recently faced rejection near the 0.5 Fibonacci level around $3,400, an outcome Luca noted was largely expected. Historically, this area has acted as a significant decision point, often attracting selling pressure and temporary pullbacks before the market decides on its next direction. Looking forward, Luca believes the overall outlook remains constructive as long as ETH continues to trade above the 1D Bull Market Support Band and the 0.618 Fibonacci level. Maintaining these supports would keep the path open for renewed upside attempts, even if short-term consolidations occur, and the analyst’s positioning remains unchanged. ETH Above Daily 200MA, Structure Remains Constructive According to a recent post by Daan Crypto Trades, Ethereum is still advancing gradually while respecting the Daily 200-day moving average against Bitcoin. This type of slow, methodical grind often signals strength beneath the surface, suggesting that buyers remain in control even without aggressive momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Q1 Outlook: Analyst Shares Historical Setup As Price Nears Key Resistance The analyst explained that prolonged consolidations and steady climbs like this typically resolve with an acceleration phase. Should ETH break out with stronger upside momentum, it could serve as a trigger for renewed interest across the altcoin market, helping lift sentiment and price action. However, the structure remains conditional. Holding the Daily 200MA, highlighted in purple, is critical to maintaining this constructive setup. In parallel, Bitcoin must stay above the $94,000 level to maintain the broader low-timeframe bullish structure. As long as these conditions are met, the path of least resistance continues to favor further upside. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Analyst Reveals How Far Bitcoin Price Will Crash If The Uptrend Doesn’t Continue",
    "body": "A warning signal is flashing on the charts, with market analysts predicting that the Bitcoin price could collapse again soon. According to technical analysis, if BTC fails to continue its uptrend, it could repeat the bear-market crash from past cycles, potentially dragging its price down by double-digit percentages. Bitcoin Price To Repeat 2022 Bear Market Crash? Crypto analyst Tyrex believes that Bitcoin may be approaching a critical turning point if the current uptrend fails to hold. In his latest BTC price outlook on X, he compares the current market structure to the April 2022 cycle, when Bitcoin made an ATH and then crashed hard for weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum On Fire: User Growth Sparks Massive Activity Spike Tyrex disclosed that Bitcoin dropped roughly 45% from its all-time high in 2022 before entering an extended consolidation phase that lasted nearly four months. The accompanying chart shows that during that period, prices respected clear horizontal boundaries, creating a false sense of strength and stability, all while underlying weakness continued to build. That consolidation eventually led to an upside fakeout, with the Bitcoin price briefly breaking resistance before reversing sharply. Unfortunately, the rejection triggered a continuation of the broader downtrend that year, resulting in another aggressive price crash that wiped out remaining bullish confidence. According to Tyrex, BTC’s current chart structure closely mirrors the same historical setup from 2022. Bitcoin has once again pulled back sharply after reaching an all-time high of over $126,000. Additionally, the cryptocurrency has spent roughly two months consolidating within a defined range, repeatedly stalling at resistance levels. Tyrex warns that Bitcoin is barely holding above $95,000, which aligns with the resistance zone shown on the chart. If price fails to recover and continues to stall near this level, the move higher could turn out to be a fakeout, potentially leading to another sharp dump— just as it did in 2022. The red-shaded area on the chart shows how far BTC could crash if the uptrend breaks, with the analyst projecting an 11.04% drop to the $86,000-$84,000 range. Bitcoin Set For March ATH And May Flash Crash Another forecast from market expert CryptoXLarge outlines where Bitcoin could be headed over the next four months. The analyst bases the outlook on historical market behavior, suggesting the current cycle may be replicating past cycle peaks. CryptoXLarge points to January 2026 as a phase of quiet accumulation with controlled price action and muted volatility. February is expected to bring a powerful rally as momentum builds rapidly and buyers push the BTC price higher. This surge could set the stage for Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high around $240,000 in March.
