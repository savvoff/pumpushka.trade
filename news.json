    "title": "Dogecoin Price On The Brink Of A 9,000% Rally To $10? What Historical Performance Shows",
    "body": "Dogecoin has spent a large part of the current cycle moving sideways, leaving its long-term chart largely defined by a downtrend. However, a technical study of Dogecoin’s previous market cycles, where similar stretches of compression preceded outsized price expansions, points to instances where Dogecoin can rally to price targets anywhere between $10 and $20 in the current cycle. How Dogecoin Performed During Previous Alt-Seasons A recent technical analysis shared by crypto analyst Javon Marks on the social media platform X looks at direct comparisons between Dogecoin’s current structure and the setups that led to its most dramatic rallies in the past. Related Reading: Dogecoin Long-Term Bullish Structure Still In Play And Will Cross $10 Looking back at previous market cycles, Dogecoin went through some of the biggest magnitudes of rallies, even within the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. During its first major alt-season run, Dogecoin surged by more than 9,000% from its base to reach a new peak of $0.015 in early 2018. Back then, this rally caught many doubters off guard, considering the fact that Dogecoin had no inherent value at the time and was the first mover in a niche of meme coins. What followed in the next cycle was even more extreme, with the second major expansion delivering gains of about 28,000% in 2021. This rally was enough to establish Dogecoin’s reputation as the king of meme coins, and the all-time high of $0.73 it reached back then is yet to be broken. The chart that followed Marks’ analysis shows that each rally began after prolonged periods where Dogecoin appeared largely stagnant and was trading sideways. What A 9,000% Or 20,000% Move Means For DOGE Applying those percentage gains to Dogecoin’s current price range produces eye-catching figures that propose a break above the anticipated $1 level and even above double digits. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Rally To All-Time Highs If It Breaks This Resistance Level A move similar to the first major alt-season rally, roughly 9,000%, would place Dogecoin around the $10 price level. A repeat of the second cycle’s performance would push the price far higher. to as high as $20. These are ultra-bullish targets that seem unrealistic based on Dogecoin’s current price levels. However, the analyst also highlighted near-term reference zones that sit well below the most extreme projections but still reflect meaningful upside. Price levels around $0.6533 and $1.25111 were identified as more realistic milestones within a bullish scenario. Interestingly, these are also very bullish, as they represent increases of 340% and 740%, respectively, from Dogecoin’s price range around $0.15. Not everyone reading the chart arrives at the same conclusion, and that difference in interpretation was evident in comments under Marks’ post. Another Dogecoin analyst, KrissPax, responded by saying there’s a difference between a full alt-season and what he described as a relief rally. According to KrissPax, nothing in the current chart suggests a $20 Dogecoin this year. However, Marks explained that the idea is not that Dogecoin will certainly reach $10 or $20 this year, but to show what types of gains to expect if another alt-season unfolds, which is looking more and more likely.

    "body": "On Monday, Bitcoin successfully reclaimed the $93,000 mark, spurred by a wave of renewed optimism that has also revitalized altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL), all of which are experiencing recoveries not seen in nearly a month. According to data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin has recorded a weekly surge of 7%, while Ethereum and Solana have outperformed the leading cryptocurrency with increases of nearly 9% during the same period. Notably, XRP has taken the lead, boasting a significant 15% uptrend. Large Holders Drive Bitcoin Surge A key driver behind this recent surge, especially for Bitcoin, can be attributed to large holders, or “whales,” who have acquired approximately 270,000 BTC in the last 30 days, amounting to roughly $23 billion. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On The Brink Of A 9,000% Rally To $10? What Historical Performance Shows Market analyst NoLimit highlighted this crucial development in a recent social media post, noting its significance: this accumulation represents 1.3% of Bitcoin’s total supply and marks the largest net buy from this group in 13 years. However, NoLimit asserts that this doesn’t imply that Bitcoin will see an immediate surge in its value. It indicates that long-term investors are aggressively positioning themselves even while the broader market sentiment remains mixed. Will BTC Establish A Macro Lower High? In the short term, though, market analyst Rekt Capital warns that despite Bitcoin hovering just above $93,400, it has closed its 12-month candle below the $93,500 mark. This suggests that the $93,500 level is likely to act as resistance moving forward. Historical patterns across four-year cycles indicate that such resistances can hinder price movement for an extended period, often resisting for up to three years before being breached in the next Halving year. Related Reading: Venezuela, Geopolitical Risk, And Bitcoin: What On-Chain Data Really Shows Should Bitcoin indeed be in the early stages of a bear market, this could imply that prices might surpass the $93,500 resistance in the coming months only to establish a macro lower high before continuing their downward trajectory. According to Rekt Capital, the sustainable breakout above this resistance is more likely to occur in the next halving year in 2028. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "body": "Consumer use of crypto-linked payment cards continued to gain traction heading into 2026, following a sharp rise in spending volumes reported by Visa for 2025. Data from Dune Analytics shows that spending across Visa-backed crypto cards increased steadily throughout last year, a significant growth. Related Reading: XRP Is Setting Up For Its ‘Next Explosive Move,’ Analysts Say: Here’s The Target Across six Visa-partnered crypto card programs, total net spending rose from $14.6 million in January 2025 to $91.3 million by December. The increase represents a 525% jump over the year and reflects growing consumer comfort with paying directly from crypto wallets at traditional points of sale. The cards are issued by a mix of crypto payment platforms and decentralized finance projects, including EtherFi, Cypher, GnosisPay, Avici Money, Exa App, and Moonwell. ETH's price trends slightly to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview EtherFi and Cypher Lead Visa Crypto Card Spending Among the tracked programs, EtherFi recorded the highest spending volume, accounting for $55.4 million in transactions during 2025. That figure placed it well ahead of Cypher, which ranked second with $20.5 million in total spend. The remaining card issuers posted smaller but consistent increases, suggesting broader participation across the ecosystem rather than growth driven by a single outlier. Monthly spending data shows a gradual rise throughout the year, with no major spikes or sharp reversals. Analysts say this pattern points to routine usage rather than one-off events. Commenting on the data, Polygon researcher Alex Obchakevich noted that crypto card spending increasingly reflects regular financial behavior, indicating that crypto-linked cards are moving beyond experimental use cases. Visa Expands Stablecoin Infrastructure Visa’s growing role in crypto payments has been supported by its expanding stablecoin infrastructure. The payments firm now enables stablecoin settlement across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Stellar. This setup allows card issuers to convert crypto balances to fiat in real time during transactions, while still relying on Visa’s global merchant network. In December 2025, Visa also launched a stablecoin advisory team focused on helping banks, merchants, and fintech companies design and manage stablecoin-based products. The initiative highlights Visa’s view that blockchain-based settlement and programmable money are becoming more relevant to mainstream payments. Outlook for Crypto Card Usage in 2026 With spending volumes rising and infrastructure continuing to expand, crypto card usage is expected to grow further in 2026. While volumes remain concentrated in the U.S., Europe, and parts of the Asia-Pacific region, the steady increase suggests consumer crypto spending is becoming more normalized.

    "body": "A crypto analyst who previously predicted that the XRP price could rise toward $16 has now updated his outlook to a higher target. According to the revised projection, XRP is preparing to rally above $18, a level that would represent a staggering 369% surge from its current all-time high of about $3.84 Updated XRP Price Forecast Eyes Breakout Above $16 Crypto market analyst ChartNerd has updated his XRP price outlook from a previous analysis, reinforcing his bullish stance while outlining two potential market scenarios. He described the structure in his chart analysis as a Staircase to Valhalla, implying that XRP could move through distinct phases toward a higher valuation above $18, rather than experiencing a single explosive surge. Related Reading: Pi Cycle Top Put XRP Price At $300, But Is This Feasible? In his post on X, the expert stated that XRP is reacting positively from a key Vertical Accumulation Support zone that has acted as a defense barrier for roughly 13 months around $1.99. He emphasized that this area successfully held price and is now serving as the base layer for a potential continuation higher. According to the analyst’s chart, Scenario 1, which shows XRP already moving above the Vertical Accumulation Support area, remains the more bullish outcome and currently has the advantage. However, he cautions that confirmation will only come if XRP can break above the Vertical Accumulation Resistance zone between $3.1 and $3.7. If this happens, a stronger price rally can be validated. Notably, ChartNerd outlines a final “Markup” phase with a bullish target of $18-$22 for XRP. This projection reflects a steep expansion zone shown on the chart following a successful breakout from the Vertical Accumulation Resistance and a subsequent consolidation period. ChartNerd also outlines a second scenario, which presents a more bearish path for XRP. In this case, the cryptocurrency could dip below $1.5 from its current price above $2 before attempting to approach the vertical accumulation resistance again. In the near term, he agreed that XRP is currently at support and suggested that a break above $2.20 could open the door to further upside. Analyst Says 2026 Will Be A Landmark Year For XRP In a recent post, ChartNerd shared a chart highlighting a historical structure that closely mirrors XRP’s price behavior in 2016. During that period, XRP was quietly building momentum that eventually fueled its bullish surge in January 2018. Related Reading: XRP Price Mirrors 2017 Sideways Accumulation Trend – Here’s What Happened Last Time ChartNerd has suggested that if history repeats itself, 2026 could become a landmark year for XRP, potentially setting new records and marking a major milestone for the cryptocurrency. The analyst described the 2026 pattern as an uncannily similar formation, featuring the same Double Top formation and wick drop seen in the 2016 structure. Additionally, both timelines experienced a Stochastic Relative Strength Index (SRSI) reset, reinforcing the expert’s thesis that XRP could replicate its 2016 bullish trend in 2026.

    "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) has opened 2026 with renewed momentum, extending a recovery that began in the final days of December and pushing prices back above key psychological levels. Related Reading: XRP Is Setting Up For Its ‘Next Explosive Move,’ Analysts Say: Here’s The Target After ending 2025 with a modest decline that challenged expectations around the traditional four-year cycle, the largest asset has reclaimed the $90,000 zone and is trading above $92,000. The move reflects a mix of technical breakouts, steady institutional inflows, and easing selling pressure, even with long-term skepticisms. BTC's price records moderate gains on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Technical Structure Points to Higher Levels On the daily chart, Bitcoin (BTC) has been forming a rounded base that resembles the early stages of a cup-and-handle pattern, a structure often associated with trend continuation. Recent candles have closed higher, though long upper wicks suggest some resistance near current levels. Analysts note that maintaining a sustained hold above the $89,500–$90,000 range is crucial to sustaining the bullish setup. A confirmed break above the $94,700 area could validate the pattern and open the door to a measured move toward the $100,000–$104,000 zone, implying roughly 10–12% upside from recent prices. Shorter-term indicators also show improving momentum, with higher lows forming on lower time frames and moving averages beginning to turn upward. However, elevated leverage on derivatives platforms means that pullbacks could still trigger sharp liquidations if support levels are breached. Bitcoin ETF Inflows and On-Chain Data Support the Move Beyond charts, underlying market data points to reduced distribution. Exchange inflows have dropped sharply since the end of December, signaling lower immediate selling pressure. On-chain metrics show both short-term and long-term holders moving fewer coins, suggesting a preference to hold rather than sell into strength. Institutional demand has also re-emerged through spot Bitcoin ETFs. Early January saw more than $600 million in net inflows in a single session, reinforcing the view that larger investors continue to treat Bitcoin as a portfolio allocation rather than a short-term trade. This steady accumulation has helped Bitcoin absorb macro-driven volatility, including recent geopolitical headlines that briefly lifted broader risk assets. Skepticism Remains as Market Eyes 2026 Outlook Not everyone is convinced the recovery will last. Economist Peter Schiff has reiterated his long-standing view that Bitcoin’s rally is unsustainable, arguing that recent gains in precious metals offer a stronger long-term case.

    "body": "The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices are rising today, with the flagship crypto rising to as high as $93,000. This market rally comes on the back of several factors, including the U.S.-Venezuela escalations, which have increased risk sentiment. Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Are Up In an X post, market commentator The Kobeissi Letter noted that risky assets seem to be gaining momentum despite the U.S. capture of former Venezuelan president Maduro. This suggests risk sentiment may be back after the year-end decline in 2025, which has contributed to the recent rise in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices. Related Reading: Here’s How Much BlackRock Spent Buying Bitcoin And Ethereum In 2025 The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices are also rising on the back of an increase in the M2 money supply, which now stands at $22.4 trillion, according to data from the St. Louis Fed. This is bullish for crypto assets as some of this liquidity is expected to flow into the crypto ecosystem. Meanwhile, the U.S. debt continues to rise, standing at $38.6 trillion, a development that is bullish for crypto as investors hedge against inflation by allocating to these asset classes. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the Fed has also been carrying out its Reserve Management Purchases (RMP), which experts such as James Lavish have described as a form of quantitative easing (QE), which is positive for the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has even predicted that BTC could rally to as high as $200,000 on the back of this move from the Fed. Meanwhile, the Fed has also been injecting liquidity into the economy through the New York Fed’s repo operations. Crypto Bulls Are Back In Control Market analyst Ted Pilliows also suggested that the crypto bulls are back in control, which is why the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices are rising. In an X post, he noted that BTC has large sell orders from the $92,000 to $95,000 level on Binance. Ted added that if bulls push BTC above the $95,000 level, there is very little resistance until $100,000, suggesting a rally to this psychological level could be on the cards. Related Reading: Dogecoin Reclaiming $0.128 Support Could Signal The Perfect Chance For Long Positions In another X post, the market analyst noted that the Coinbase Bitcoin premium is recovering, with institutional demand for BTC picking up again. SoSoValue data show that Bitcoin ETFs recorded a daily net inflow of $471.14 million on January 2, their largest since December 17. A sustained daily net inflow could lead to higher prices for BTC, which is also a positive for the Ethereum and Dogecoin prices. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $92,400, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pngtree, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Early XRP Investors Sell-Offs Keep Price Low, Here’s How They’re Doing It",
    "body": "XRP’s price has remained restrained despite steady activity around the asset, and recent commentary helps explain the disconnect. According to Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group, the explanation lies beyond Ripple’s escrow releases or retail behavior, pointing instead to structural factors influencing how XRP supply reaches the market. How XRP Investors Are Selling Without Spooking The Market Claver explained in a recent post on X that large XRP sales are primarily happening through institutional channels such as over-the-counter (OTC) trades and dark pools that keep activity out of public view, rather than on public exchanges. He specifically pointed to platforms such as FalconX and Kraken’s dark pool infrastructure. These venues are designed for institutions, hedge funds, and early investors who want to move large positions without advertising their intentions on open order books. Related Reading: Popular Crypto Founder Dumps Millions In Ethereum, Here’s What He’s Buying This matters because public exchanges are highly sensitive to large sell orders. When big sales appear on an exchange, they often cause rapid price declines as other traders react. OTC desks operate differently. They match buyers and sellers privately, allowing XRP to change hands without immediate impact on visible market prices. As a result, significant amounts of XRP can be sold while the chart appears relatively stable. For early investors who accumulated XRP at much lower prices years ago, this approach is highly efficient. It allows them to gradually exit or rebalance positions while protecting execution quality. For the broader market, however, it creates a disconnect. Demand may exist, but as long as a steady supply is being released through private channels, upward price momentum remains limited. This explains why XRP can struggle to break higher even in periods of positive sentiment or strong network-related narratives. ETF Demand Is Quietly Draining The Same Liquidity Pool An important extension of Claver’s point came not from a comment beneath his original post. A reader asked for a “best estimate” on when OTC desks might run out of supply. He responded that supply is shrinking every day, with ETFs actively depleting available liquidity. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Price Reach $1 In 2026? Analysts Reveal What To Expect This exchange is critical for understanding the bigger picture. ETFs do not typically buy XRP on public exchanges in a way that distorts price. Instead, they source liquidity through OTC desks, the same channels early investors are using to sell. This means ETFs are steadily absorbing XRP that would otherwise remain available for quiet distribution. Over time, this dynamic changes market structure. As ETFs and other institutional products continue to draw down OTC inventories, early investors will have fewer opportunities to sell large positions without touching public markets. When that happens, selling activity becomes more visible, and price discovery shifts back onto exchanges. Until OTC supply tightens meaningfully, XRP’s price may remain capped despite ongoing demand. The key takeaway is straightforward: current price suppression is not a lack of interest in XRP, but a consequence of how and where early investors are choosing to sell.

    "title": "Bitcoin Climbs Past $92K While Trump Signals Colombia Action",
    "body": "Bitcoin climbed past the $92,000 mark on Monday, driven by a mix of strong buying and fresh geopolitical noise. Traders watched as BTC moved toward $93,000 after brief gains in global markets, hitting roughly $92,800 in early US trading. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s 16% Pop Signals Meme Coin Revival – Details Geopolitical Jitters And Market Moves According to market reports, comments from US President Donald Trump about potential action in Colombia added to market uncertainty, helping send flows into risk assets like Bitcoin. Traders sold some positions and then bought back into BTC as prices steadied near the highs. ETF inflows were also cited as supporting demand, with one report noting about $645 million in net flows into Bitcoin spot ETFs around the same session. Bitcoin’s climb was modest in percentage terms, but the dollar amounts grabbed attention. Data showed BTC trading in the low $92,000s before attempts to push higher toward $93,000. Reports have also pointed to liquidations and futures activity that rearranged short positions, prompting quick moves in both directions. PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST NOW: Trump: “Colombia is run by a sick man, he’s not going to be doing it for very long.” Reporter: “So there will be an operation by the US in Colombia?” Trump: “Sounds good to me.” pic.twitter.com/66fQM7cEIY — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) January 5, 2026 Colombia On Trump’s Crosshairs Based on reports, the recent US operation in Venezuela and wider tensions in Latin America had a role in shifting sentiment. Speaking on Sunday, Trump took aim at Colombia over cocaine trafficking, saying a fresh US military operation tied to the country “sounds good to me,” according to Reuters. He also warned that action may be needed in Mexico. Trump described Colombia as “very sick” and accused its leader of fueling the cocaine trade into the United States, saying that situation “won’t last very long.” Total crypto market valuation at $3.12 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView Institutional Flows And Market Structure Meanwhile, spot ETF purchases and macro traders were active during the move higher. The inflows cited in market pieces suggest institutions continued to add exposure, even as headline risk rose. At the same time, derivatives desks reported notable liquidations that briefly amplified volatility. Some analysts told outlets they see technical hurdles near the current range that could cap gains without fresh catalysts. Others said the next key levels to watch are the area around $93,000 and the lows near the $88,000s to $90,000s, where stop orders and margin calls could trigger sharper swings. Related Reading: $18 Million Ethereum Loss Sends Whale Running To Gold Mixed Signals Market signals remain mixed. While ETF inflows point to steady interest from larger pools of capital, geopolitical headlines from the region keep a risk premium live in prices. Traders are watching US economic data this week as well, since work on jobs and inflation prints could alter the tone for both stocks and crypto. Bitcoin’s push above $92,000 came at a moment of heightened news flow — where comments from US President Donald Trump and big institutional buying intersected. Prices moved quickly, numbers mattered, and traders now watch whether demand can hold near current levels or if headline risk will force a pullback.

    "title": "Bitcoin Wealth Isn’t About Hype—It’s About Time And Stacking, Expert Says",
    "body": "According to an exchange on X, a user asked when Bitcoin would “boom.” A crypto expert answered bluntly that relying on a single price explosion to get rich is the wrong plan and summed up his approach as “time plus stacking.” The remark cut through the guessing and put the focus back on steady habits, not wild hopes. Related Reading: A Maduro Bet, A Market Alarm: US Lawmaker Targets Trading Abuses Bitcoin As A Store Of Value Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, with a hard cap of 21 million coins. That matters because, as Jeremie and other long-term holders point out, Bitcoin is best used to hold value you earned elsewhere. Stacking, in practice, means buying small amounts regularly. Time means keeping those holdings for years. Both together reduce the pressure to guess tops and bottoms and make the plan mechanical rather than emotional. Many buyers still chase quick gains. They ask when the next big run will hit. The answer from long-term traders is simple: hope is not a plan. Fiat money often loses buying power over time, while Bitcoin’s limited supply is designed to preserve value for those who hold through cycles. If you’re relying on #Bitcoin to “boom” to make you rich, you’re doing it wrong. Bitcoin is for storing what you earn. The win is time plus stacking. https://t.co/PDdrf3G6nv — Davinci Jeremie (@Davincij15) January 5, 2026 Price Movements And Political Ties Based on reports, Bitcoin hit a three-week high and traded above $93,000, rising as much as 2.54% on Monday morning. The token cleared its 50-day moving average for the first time since the market tumble that began in early October. Bitcoin is up about 6% so far this year after plunging roughly 22% in the fourth quarter. Ether also moved higher alongside Bitcoin as broader markets rallied. Political events, including the ouster of Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro by US special forces and related developments, pushed some investors toward safe-haven assets like gold and silver while not putting a clear dent in appetite for riskier bets like tech stocks. Trading activity and headline news have been linked to short-term moves in crypto prices more than once this year. How Ordinary Investors Should Act According to veteran holders, the mix of steady buying and patience beats timing the market. That is the core of Jeremie’s message. Buy small. Keep adding. Don’t watch the screen every hour. Over time, that habit smooths out the big swings and removes emotional buying at highs and panic selling at lows. Reports indicate many newcomers still treat Bitcoin like a lotto ticket. That mindset fuels big swings. When prices climb, people rush in. When they fall, sellers rush out. The strategy Jeremie described aims to flip that behavior: make accumulation routine, make holding routine. Related Reading: Crypto Users Lose Far Less To Phishing As Losses Drop 83% – Details Market Signals And A Clear Choice Traders can use signals such as moving averages to judge momentum, but technical signs are not a plan by themselves. For people who want to use Bitcoin to protect savings, the clear choice is steady accumulation plus a long holding period. For those chasing a sudden “boom,” the risk is high and the outcome uncertain — at least according to the analyst. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "body": "Dogecoin started a major increase above $0.150 against the US Dollar. DOGE is now consolidating and might decline if it trades below $0.1450. DOGE price started a fresh increase above $0.1450 and $0.150. The price is trading above the $0.150 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.150 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could aim for a fresh increase if it remains stable above $0.1450. Dogecoin Price Consolidates Gains Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above $0.1320, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE climbed above the $0.140 resistance to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above $0.150. A high was formed at $0.1541 and the price is now correcting some gains. There was a move toward the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1156 swing low to the $0.1541 high. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.150 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.150 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. If there is another increase, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1540 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.1550 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1620 level. A close above the $0.1620 resistance might send the price toward $0.1750. Any more gains might send the price toward $0.180. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1840. Downside Break In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1550 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.150 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $0.145 level. The main support sits at $0.1420. If there is a downside break below the $0.1420 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.1350 level or even $0.1320 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.150 and $0.1450. Major Resistance Levels – $0.1540 and $0.1550.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Accumulation Continues: Strategy Purchases 1,287 BTC Amid Rising Prices",
    "body": "On Monday, Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, announced a new acquisition of Bitcoin (BTC) in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Notably, this latest purchase brings the company’s total holdings to nearly 680,000 BTC, with current figures standing at 672,497 BTC. Bitcoin Buys Vs. Stock Struggles Analysts, including Lirrato on the social media platform X, revealed that the company acquired 22,498 BTC in December alone. To reach the target of 680,000 BTC by January, Strategy needs only 7,503 more coins—an amount they surpassed last month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches $93,000 Amid Renewed Optimism: What To Keep An Eye On This Week However, despite this bullish acquisition, the company’s stock (MSTR) has experienced a significant decline, plummeting by over 50% throughout 2025 to its current trading price of around $163 on Monday. Adding to the challenges facing Strategy, the firm could be just ten days away from being delisted from the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) index, awaiting for the formal announcement. In an October proposal, MSCI indicated that firms holding digital assets amounting to 50% or more of their total assets should be removed from its global benchmarks. This move was justified by MSCI’s assertion that these firms resemble investment funds, which are excluded from its indexes. Strategy Braces For Potential Financial Turmoil Presently, MSCI is conducting a public consultation, and if it determines that Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies like Strategy should be excluded, it could set a precedent that other index providers might follow. In a public letter, Strategy’s CEO, Phong Le, and co-founder Michael Saylor discussed the possible implications of an MSCI exclusion. They estimated that such a decision could lead to around $2.8 billion worth of the company’s stock being liquidated, creating a potential chilling effect across the entire industry. Analysts from TD Cowen highlighted that approximately $2.5 billion of Strategy’s market value is tied to MSCI, while an additional $5.5 billion hinges on other indexes. JPMorgan’s analysis suggests that if MSCI were to exclude Strategy, the company could face $2.8 billion in outflows, a number that could escalate to $8.8 billion if it were delisted from additional indexes, including the Nasdaq 100, the CRSP US Total Market Index, and various Russell indexes owned by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). Related Reading: Consumer Crypto Spending Grows in 2026 as Visa Reports Major Card Growth Alongside these potential challenges, Strategy may soon have to contend with substantial financial losses that starkly contrast the $2.8 billion profit they reported in the previous year’s third quarter. Additionally, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index indicates that Michael Saylor has seen his personal wealth diminish dramatically during this downturn, dropping approximately 40% to about $3.8 billion. Nevertheless, on Monday, cryptocurrency prices saw a notable recovery, with Bitcoin and other digital assets such as Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL) and XRP climbing back above key levels, sparking a new wave of optimism among investors.

    "body": "While Ethereum (ETH) attempts to turn a crucial level into support, some analysts have shared a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency, which could send its price above the $4,000 barrier in the first quarter of 2026. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On The Brink Of A 9,000% Rally To $10? What Historical Performance Shows End-Of-Year Weakness To Ignite Q1 Rally On Monday, Ethereum broke above the $3,200 barrier for the first time in nearly a month, hitting a four-week high of $3,259. The cryptocurrency has seen a 8.3% surge from the crucial $3,000 level since Friday, consolidating above the $3,100 level over the weekend. Now, the King of Altcoins is trying to hold the key resistance level and turn it into support. Amid this performance, some market observers shared a potential setup that could lead to a significant rally during the next three months. In an X post, analyst Niels affirmed that Ethereum’s quarterly close in the red is “not as bearish as it looks.” Notably, the altcoin recorded its worst Q4 in six years after closing the quarter with a negative return of 28.28%, according to CoinGlass data. This marks ETH’s first negative Q4 close since 2022, and its worst end-of-year performance since 2019, when it registered a negative return of 28.9%. Nonetheless, Niels highlighted that this opens the door for an “interesting” setup ahead of the altcoin’s expected seasonality. “History tells an interesting story: every single time ETH has finished Q4 in the red, the next Q1 has closed green,” the analyst explained, asserting that “year-end weakness has usually acted as a reset, not a reversal.” Per the post, the end-of-year leverage flush and sentiment cooling have previously enabled Ethereum to start the new year “from a cleaner base,” which has allowed the altcoin to register quarterly returns of up to 52% in recent years. “If that pattern holds, Q4 wasn’t the warning; it was the setup heading into Q1,” he suggested. Ethereum Prepares For 30% Breakout As the price records an 11% weekly surge, analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that the cryptocurrency is about to face an important zone that has served as resistance for nearly two months. Since the early November pullback, the largest altcoin by market capitalization has been trading between the $2,700-$3,400 price range, experiencing strong resistance around the $3,000 and $3,200 levels. Now that the mid-zone of the range has been momentarily reclaimed, ETH must hold its momentum and turn the upper boundary into support. “A reclaim of this level will pump Ethereum towards the $3,800-$4,000 level,” where the next major resistance is located, Ted explained on Monday morning. On the contrary, a rejection from this resistance zone could send the ETH price toward the $3,000 support, while risking a longer consolidation within its two-month range.

According to the analyst, Ethereum has been compressing between the pattern’s ascending and descending trendlines since November, awaiting a 30% move. If the price holds its current breakout from the upper boundary, the cryptocurrency could see a rally toward the $4,000 area in the coming weeks, positioning ETH for a retest of the Q3 levels. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,253, a 3.4% increase in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Surges Towards $2.20: Leading Monday Gains And Driving Crypto ETF Inflows",
    "body": "In 2025, XRP emerged as the best-performing token among the top ten largest cryptocurrencies, outpacing gains from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). As the first week of 2026 unfolds, XRP has continued this upward trend, recording a 17% surge over the past week that has propelled its price back above the key $2.20 threshold. Strong ETF Demand Pushes XRP Forward One of the prominent factors contributing to this surge is the strong performance of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which became a standout in the market by attracting $483 million over the past weeks. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs experienced a significant outflow of $1.09 billion, while Ethereum products faced a loss of $564 million. XRP funds not only achieved $483 million in inflows during December but also maintained a steady influx for 30 consecutive trading days. This streak finally ended on December 26 with the first day of zero inflows. Overall, since their launch in November, total inflows into XRP exchange-traded funds have amassed to $1.3 billion, marking the fastest adoption rate for any altcoin ETF to date. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches $93,000 Amid Renewed Optimism: What To Keep An Eye On This Week Looking ahead, reports suggest that the ETF landscape could be pivotal in shaping bullish scenarios for XRP. A potential filing by BlackRock for an XRP ETF could serve as a significant credibility boost, attracting conservative institutional investors to the space. BlackRock’s own $40 billion Bitcoin ETF exemplifies the capacity to mobilize capital effectively through its Aladdin platform connections. Additionally, the scaling of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin into banking and remittance services could generate ongoing demand for XRP as a critical bridge asset. There are also signs that the Federal Reserve could implement several rate cuts in 2026, which would lower the opportunity cost of investing in risk assets. Under such conditions, it is alleged that the XRP price might break through its all-time high of $3.84, potentially escalating toward the $4.00 to $5.00 range by year-end. On The Cusp Of Major Gains? When it comes to price action, market analyst Dark Defender, active on the social media platform X (previously Twitter), recently highlighted XRP’s price action by providing a three-month time frame update. The analyst noted that a newly initiated green candle in January exhibits a bullish Relative Strength Index (RSI). According to Dark Defender, surpassing the $2.22 level is crucial for XRP. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On The Brink Of A 9,000% Rally To $10? What Historical Performance Shows He further suggested that XRP could be on the brink of a significant surge, similar to silver, and pointed to ambitious targets such as $6 and even as high as $20 in the future. Achieving $6 would represent a notable 171% increase from current trading prices, while reaching the $20 mark would indicate a staggering 800% rise. While trading at $2.21 at the time of writing, the token is still facing $2.22 as the next major short-term resistance level, and is also trading at 40% below its all-time high.

    "body": "On-chain data suggests Bitcoin miner capitulation may have ended as the Hash Ribbons indicator has printed a fresh buy signal. Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Have Seen A Bullish Crossover As highlighted by Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards in a new X post, the Hash Ribbons has just given a signal for Bitcoin. The “Hash Ribbons” here refers to a metric created by Edwards that basically provides a representation of the miners’ situation. Related Reading: PEPE Explodes 62%, But Analyst Warns Of Breakdown Retest It does so by comparing two moving averages (MAs) of the “Hashrate,” an indicator that measures the total amount of computing power that the miners have connected to the network. When the value of this metric rises, it suggests existing miners are expanding their facilities and/or new ones are joining the blockchain. Such a trend implies these validators may be finding BTC mining to be an attractive venture. On the other hand, the indicator going down suggests some of the miners have decided to disconnect from the network, potentially because they are no longer able to break even on mining activities. The Hash Ribbons aims to pinpoint when one of these behaviors becomes dominant. The 30-day and 60-day MAs of the Hashrate play the role of the “ribbons” and their crossovers provide signals for shifts in miners’ condition. The 30-day MA moving below the 60-day one is considered to signal the start of a “miner capitulation.” In this phase, miners are under pressure and BTC may arrive at a bottom. The reverse crossover implies the return of conviction among miners, which has often been followed by bullish price action. Below is the chart for the Hash Ribbons shared by the analyst that shows the signals that Bitcoin has witnessed over the last few years. As is visible in the graph, the 30-day MA of the Bitcoin Hashrate fell below the 60-day ribbon last year as miners reduced their computing power in response to the bearish price action in the cryptocurrency. After a period of staying in the capitulation region, the reverse crossover has now finally occurred, meaning that the situation of the miners is improving, at least from the perspective of the Hash Ribbons. From the chart, it’s visible that this kind of “buy signal” occurred at some key points in the last few years. The recovery from 2022 bear market in 2023, for example, took place after a bullish crossover in the Hash Ribbons. The mini-bear phase in mid-2021 also broke with a buy signal from the indicator.

    "title": "John Bollinger: Bitcoin BB Squeeze Breakout Targets $107,000",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s daily chart is flashing what John Bollinger calls “a little classic technical analysis”: a well-formed base followed by a Bollinger Band Squeeze and an upside breakout that puts $100,000 and roughly $107,000 in view, so long as price can hold the move and avoid slipping back into the prior range. Bitcoin Rebound To $107,000 Next? “Near perfect base for BTCUSD with a Bollinger Band Squeeze and breakout,” Bollinger wrote alongside the chart. “First upside target 100,000, second ~107,000, third ??? If we fail here it is back into the trenches.” On the daily timeframe, BTC spent much of the late-year period carving out a sideways-to-slightly-higher base after the sharp Q4 selloff. The chart explicitly labels that “Base” region, with price repeatedly holding a low-to-mid $80,000s floor area before turning higher. That basing process matters in Bollinger’s framing because it provided the platform for volatility compression to do its work. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Recovery Extends Into 2026 as Charts Hint at Another Leg Higher The squeeze is visible in the Bollinger BandWidth panel at the bottom of the chart, where BandWidth sinks to a marked low (“Squeeze”) and then begins to turn up. That inflection is paired with a sharp surge in the %B panel (the middle indicator pane), where %B drives up through the 1.0 line, an on-chart signal that price has pushed beyond the upper Bollinger Band. Bollinger annotates that moment as the “Breakout,” and the price panel shows the market accelerating higher off the base as the bands begin to open. On Bollinger’s chart, BTC is trading at $94,484, with the upper band curling higher and the mid-band rising beneath price. In plain terms: the move is no longer just compression; it is active expansion. Bollinger’s chart draws two horizontal red targets above current price: the first at $100,000 and the second near $107,000. Related Reading: The Real Reason Bitcoin Is Stuck: Futures Trading Dwarfs ETFs 20-To-1 The risk control is equally clear in his commentary. “If we fail here it is back into the trenches,” he wrote, language that, in chart terms, points to BTC losing the breakout and slipping back into the prior base region which is capped at the $93,500 region. This price level is of utmost importance for Bollinger. What About ETH And XRP? Bollinger also addressed the broader crypto market:“Someone asked about ETHUSD. Same pattern, a bit delayed, following not leading,” he wrote, positioning ether as a lagging participant rather than the driver. For XRP, Bollinger’s take was more cautious despite the obvious lift. “And ripple, strong lift, but the pattern is weaker. BTC > ETH > XRP for now.” At press time, BTC traded at $93,325.

    "title": "Here’s Why The Shiba Inu Price Jumped Over 13%",
    "body": "The Shiba Inu price has recorded an unexpected gain of more than 13% recently, decisively breaking away from the extended bear trend that had suppressed its momentum. Notably, 2026 is already shaping up to be a transformative year for the crypto market, with meme coins like Shiba Inu benefiting from the broader bullish shift and growing demand. With the Shiba Inu price now testing higher valuation zones, on-chain data has revealed the underlying forces behind its recent price surge Key Drivers Behind The Shiba Inu Price Rally Shiba Inu surged more than 13% on Sunday, January 4, as the broader 2026 meme coin frenzy began unexpectedly and continued to rotate capital among speculative assets. According to data from Santiment, a crypto analytics platform, SHIB’s sudden upside move was largely driven by aggressive accumulation from top whales rather than a surge in retail demand. Related Reading: Here Are The Top Meme Coins Leading The Crypto Recovery Ahead Of Dogecoin And Shiba Inu In a post on X, Santiment analysts noted that large holders were tightening their grip on Shiba Inu’s supply amid muted retail distribution. This behaviour points to growing confidence among dominant whale wallets and suggests that the recent price rally was not fueled by short-term, hype-driven buying. Price data also shows the Shiba Inu climb began at the start of January this year, after spending several weeks consolidating near recent lows. Notably, the recent bounce followed a prolonged downtrend that spanned late October through December 2025, making the 13% price jump stand out as a clear shift in momentum. Overlaying the price action is a rising line on Santiment’s chart that tracks the percentage of SHIB supply held by the top 10 whale wallets. While prices fluctuated throughout the second half of 2025, this metric steadily increased, signaling consistent accumulation even as broader market conditions remained weak. At the time of the analysis, the 10 largest Shiba Inu wallets collectively controlled about 62.65% of the total supply. Such a high level of concentration is unusual and gives large token holders significant influence over short-term price movements. The single largest wallet alone held roughly 41% of the total SHIB supply, valued at approximately $3.3 billion.

Notably, the timing of Shiba Inu’s 13% price jump aligns with a visible uptick in whale concentration at the far right of the chart. As more supply became locked up, available liquidity thinned, allowing relatively modest buying pressure to push prices significantly higher. Shiba Inu’s Total Gains In 2026 So Far According to Santiment, Shiba Inu’s performance in 2026 now stands at a gain of more than 32% Year-to-Date (YTD). If wallet concentration remains elevated and whales continue to grow wealthier, volatility is likely to persist as prices respond quickly to shifts in large-holder behavior. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00000916, reflecting a roughly 5% increase in just one day. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Only 1 Week Left As XRP RSI Breakout Sets Up $10 Path, Analyst Predicts",
    "body": "XRP is compressing on the weekly chart into a clearly defined post-breakout range, and analyst Maelius (@MaeliusCrypto)argues the next directional clue will come from the RSI, with a breakout “sometime in Q1” that he expects to coincide with higher prices and a push toward $10. Maelius’ chart is a 1W XRP/USD view (Bitstamp) with a 50-week EMA overlaid. The market’s most recent regime shift is clear: a sharp vertical expansion carried XRP from a long base into a higher trading band, followed by a multi-week consolidation inside a shaded range. Is XRP Set To Explode Within 1 Week? That range is anchored by two levels the chart emphasizes. The upper boundary aligns with the prior spike high near $3.33 (the 2018 peak), while the lower boundary sits just above $1.60. At the time of the screenshot, XRP is around $2.124 on the weekly close, placing price just below the 50-week EMA, the most immediate, high-visibility pivot in Maelius’ framing. The Elliott labeling casts the current chop as a corrective wave 4 after the impulsive advance. The message is less “trend is broken” and more “trend is pausing.” Maelius added that his “conservative count assumes there is only 1W left,” implying a relatively tight window for the market to resolve the consolidation and transition into wave 5 if momentum confirms. Related Reading: XRP Is Setting Up For Its ‘Next Explosive Move,’ Analysts Say: Here’s The Target The broader layout of the chart also invites a comparison to 2017: XRP’s first major run off a base, a long mid-cycle breather, and then a second, sharper leg into the ultimate high. In the comparison within the chart, XRP rallied roughly 7,400% in about three months in early 2017, consolidated from May through December, then surged again by roughly 1,500%. Today’s sequencing is presented as similar in shape, if not necessarily in magnitude: a strong first leg from roughly November 2024 through January 2025 (roughly +500%), followed by a year-long consolidation into January 2026. In that read, the next major leg higher could be approaching, potentially shallower than the first, with wave 5 serving as the “second push” analogue. Related Reading: Analyst Updates XRP Price Prediction: Why $16 Is Still On The Table The lower panel is a weekly RSI with a descending trendline capping recent peaks. That red down-sloping line is Maelius’ timing trigger: “RSI breaks out sometime in Q1. Price goes higher.” The implication is straightforward. In his framework, momentum needs to break its own compression before price can sustain the next expansion phase. Crucially, the chart also carries a higher-degree label that places the current wave 4 within a larger wave III, rather than portraying the next wave 5 as a terminal, cycle-ending move. That aligns with his response when asked whether $10 would be a quarterly “max”: “Sometime in Q1 we should get a breakout, not necessarily a top. Next wave should be towards 10$.” If the thesis is working, XRP would be expected to reclaim the 50-week EMA and reassert acceptance back toward the range highs near $3.33, with the RSI trendline break acting as the confirmation event Maelius is watching. If it fails, continued rejection at the EMA and a breakdown through the range floor above $1.60 would keep the wave-4 corrective phase in play and delay the wave-5 path he’s mapped. At press time, XRP traded at $2.37. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",
