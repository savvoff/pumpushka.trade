    "title": "Bitcoin Sentiment Worst Since 2022 Bear As Price Crash Continues",
    "body": "Data shows the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has continued to decline recently, with its value now hitting the lowest level since the 2022 bear market. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Deep Inside Extreme Fear Zone The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tracks the average sentiment present among traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Loss Nears $900 Million, Highest Since FTX Crash The index determines the trader mentality using the data of the following five factors: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. To represent the sentiment, it makes use of a numerical scale running from zero to hundred. When the value of the indicator is above 53, it means the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed. On the other hand, the metric being under 47 suggests the dominance of fear. Naturally, the index lying between these two cutoffs implies a neutral mentality is shared by the majority. Besides these three main zones, there are also two ‘extreme’ regions called the extreme fear (25 and below) and extreme greed (above 75). After the recent market downturn, sentiment among cryptocurrency traders has deteriorated into the former of the two. Here is how the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index looks: As displayed above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has a value of 9 at the moment, which is a pretty low level. In fact, this level is so deep into extreme fear that this is the first time in the current cycle that the metric has reached it. Below is a chart that shows how the current level of extreme fear lines up against the indicator’s historical data. From the graph, it’s visible that the last time the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index reached a value this low was back in June 2022, right in the middle of that year’s bear market. The latest drop in the metric to a single-digit value is a result of the price drawdown that BTC and other cryptocurrencies have faced since the last week of January. This decline in sentiment, however, may not be such a bad thing for the sector, if history is to go by. Often, an extremely fearful market facilitates bottom formations as underwater investors capitulate and resolute hands pick up their coins. During a bear market, however, the Fear & Greed Index is usually inside the zone for a notable duration before a bottom is reached. Related Reading: XRP Social Sentiment Still Bullish While Bitcoin Mood Sours If the recent shift in the sector reflects a transition to a bear market, then it only remains to be seen how long mood will be in extreme fear before relief arrives for Bitcoin and company. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $67,100, down 19% over the last seven days. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Dogecoin Drops Below $0.09 as Market Weakness Outweighs Musk Hype",
    "body": "The latest slide in Dogecoin (DOGE) is a reminder of how quickly sentiment can shift in a fragile crypto market. Once known for sharp rallies driven by social media buzz, the meme coin is now struggling to find a footing amid broader selling pressure that overshadows brief bursts of optimism. Related Reading: 5 Red Months In A Row: What’s Going On With Bitcoin And The Crypto Market? Despite another round of speculation linked to Elon Musk, DOGE has fallen below $0.09, reflecting a market more focused on risk reduction than hype-driven trades. The decline follows a short-lived reaction to Musk’s comments about a potential Dogecoin-related moon mission. The token initially rose by about 4%, but the move faded within hours. By the end of the session, DOGE had erased its gains and continued to slide in the days that followed. Currently, Dogecoin is trading around $0.08–$0.09, marking a weekly drop of more than 20% and pushing it below several key support levels. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Dogecoin (DOGE) Selling Pressure Builds Across the Market Dogecoin’s weakness has unfolded alongside a broader crypto sell-off. Bitcoin’s breakdown, currently trading below $65,000 and major support levels, triggered widespread liquidations, pulling down high-risk assets such as meme coins. Total crypto market capitalization fell sharply, while the Fear and Greed Index dropped into “extreme fear” territory, signaling heightened caution among traders. This environment has limited the impact of Musk-related headlines. While his past remarks often sparked sustained rallies, recent reactions have been brief. Other meme tokens, including Shiba Inu, have followed a similar path, suggesting the move is less about DOGE-specific news and more about overall market stress. Technical Levels Under Pressure From a technical perspective, Dogecoin has broken below the $0.10 and $0.0950 support levels and briefly touched lows near $0.08. The price remains below key moving averages, backing the bearish trend. Analysts note resistance forming around $0.09–$0.0950, with additional barriers near $0.10 that would need to be reclaimed for any meaningful recovery. Momentum indicators continue to point lower, though some oscillators are approaching oversold levels. Trading volume has increased during the decline, indicating active participation rather than thin liquidity moves. Outlook Hinges on Macro Conditions For now, Dogecoin’s direction appears tied to broader market conditions rather than celebrity-driven catalysts. While some longer-term indicators suggest a potential basing phase could develop, short-term risks remain skewed to the downside.

    "title": "Bitcoin Sell-Off May Be Done, Analyst Flags Recovery Signs",
    "body": "According to Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, much of the crypto complex already went through a down cycle last year even though headline coins looked steadier. Related Reading: Russia’s Biggest Exchange To Launch XRP Indices And Futures He points to heavy buying from ETFs and companies that kept Bitcoin, Ether, and XRP from showing the full brunt of those losses. Some tokens, without that same support, fell hard — in many cases by about 50%–60% — and behaved like past bear phases. Institutional Buying Accelerates Hougan Says ETF flows and corporate accumulation have shifted the balance. When institutions buy more than new supply, price pressure changes. That is what he highlights. “We ran the four-year cycle last year,” Hougan said. “We’re already at the bottom. I think we’re coming back up.” ETF purchases and corporate hoarding at times outpaced newly mined Bitcoin, creating a persistent bid under the market. Reports note the comparison to gold, where steady central bank buying first steadied prices and later helped fuel much bigger moves. “Just like gold eventually entered a parabolic move, Bitcoin will follow suit,” Hougan said. We’re just earlier in that process.” A Selective Altcoin Cycle Expected Investors are getting pickier. The next up-cycle, according to this view, will reward projects with clear use and steady activity, not every token with hype. Networks tied to stablecoins, tokenization, and real infrastructure work stand a better chance of drawing capital. Lower-quality projects that lack users or clear purpose could see little interest and remain sidelined. Bitcoin Price Action In the middle of these structural shifts, Bitcoin’s price has kept traders busy. Recently BTC slid from earlier peaks to roughly 60,000–65,000 before finding buyers and moving back above 65,000 amid a broader rebound. Geopolitical headlines pushed risk appetite up and down, and those swings helped produce one of Bitcoin’s rougher stretches in weeks. Reports say traders are watching headlines closely because news can prompt sudden outsized moves. Related Reading: Bitcoin Edges Past Gold In Appeal, JPMorgan Says A Slow Transfer From Old Hands To New Buyers Long-term holders are selling some coins while institutions move in. That hand-off can feel messy. A sale wall forms when investors who bought early decide to take profit, and large institutions step in to absorb that supply. That process has been observed in other asset classes as they mature, and it does not automatically mean demand is weakening over the long run. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "Bitcoin Must Fall 90% For Years To Pressure Strategy’s Debt, CEO Says",
    "body": "Strategy’s leadership is pushing back against growing concerns that the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC) could face serious financial stress as the cryptocurrency’s price continues to slide. Speaking after the company released its fourth‑quarter results, CEO Phong Le sought to reassure investors that the firm remains well-positioned, even as Bitcoin fell close to $60,000 on Thursday. Bitcoin Sell‑Off Tests Strategy’s Financial Resilience Bitcoin dropped roughly 50% since reaching all‑time highs of $126,000 in October of last year, a period during which Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, was aggressively accumulating the digital asset. The sell‑off has weighed heavily on the company’s share price. Strategy’s stock, trading under the ticker MSTR, sank to about $104 on Thursday, its lowest level since August 2024, after plunging more than 17% during the session. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Exposes Colossal Corporate Losses — Here’s Who’s Most Impacted For now, investors are focused on two key factors: the price of Bitcoin itself and Strategy’s ability to meet its financial obligations if the downturn deepens. Those questions loomed large as founder Michael Saylor and CEO Phong Le addressed analysts during the firm’s earnings call. Much of the attention centered on how Strategy would navigate a prolonged “Bitcoin winter,” should one materialize. Saylor has already taken steps to bolster the company’s financial flexibility, including raising a $2.25 billion cash reserve to cover preferred dividend payments totaling $888 million annually. However, investors remain uneasy about the company’s $8.2 billion in low‑ and zero‑interest convertible bonds, which could begin facing early redemptions starting in September 2027, particularly now that MSTR shares have fallen sharply. Politics, Leverage, And Valuation In Focus Saylor reiterated that the company is keeping its options open, including the possibility of selling Bitcoin if market conditions require it. He also framed crypto investing as inseparable from politics, pointing to President Donald Trump’s pro‑crypto stance and noting that Trump’s nominee for Federal Reserve (Fed) chair, Kevin Warsh, is viewed as supportive of digital assets. Still, Bitcoin fell through its post‑2024 election lows on Thursday, reflecting skepticism that the federal government will actively support Bitcoin purchases. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reinforced those doubts this week, telling Congress he lacks the authority to rescue Bitcoin markets. On the balance‑sheet front, CEO Phong Le addressed worries about Strategy’s leverage. He said the company operates with roughly one‑third the leverage of a typical high‑yield firm. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes Below $67,000 As Stifel Warns Of Potential Drop To $38,000 According to Le, Bitcoin would need to decline by about 90% for Strategy’s Bitcoin reserves to merely equal the value of its convertible debt. Even in that extreme scenario, he said, the company would explore restructuring options if it could not convert the debt into equity. Strategy’s own disclosures show an enterprise value of about $49.95 billion, compared with roughly $45.33 billion worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Enterprise value includes the company’s market capitalization, preferred shares, and convertible bonds, minus cash. If Bitcoin drops once again near $63,000, Strategy’s market cap of $35.57 billion would need to fall about 13% from its recent closing price of $106.99 to eliminate the valuation premium over its Bitcoin holdings. However, since Thursday’s crash, both Bitcoin and Strategy’s stock have made a significant recovery. Bitcoin, for example, has surged to around $69,256. MSTR has recovered above $130, marking a 20% increase in less than 24 hours and offering short-term relief. Featured image from OpenArt, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Kevin Warsh Will Trigger Bitcoin Regime Shift, Jeff Park Says",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s roughly 50% drawdown has less to do with cycle déjà vu than a deeper break in the market’s old playbook, according to Jeff Park, partner and CIO at ProCap Financial, who argues a prospective Kevin Warsh-led Federal Reserve could catalyze a regime shift in how Bitcoin trades. In an conversation with Anthony Pompliano, Park said he believes Bitcoin has been in a bear market “for quite a bit,” and warned that the familiar reflexive framework, easier policy, more liquidity, higher BTC, has stopped doing the explanatory work it once did. What Kevin Warsh Means For Bitcoin Park’s starting point was a blunt claim: the assumed linkage between Bitcoin and global liquidity has “been broken for quite some time.” He pointed to what he described as steadily rising global liquidity through 2025, citing Michael Howell’s tracking and estimating the level at roughly $170 trillion, alongside broad-based strength in other asset classes. “Asset prices have all gone up,” Park said, referencing a “frenzied rally” in metals and corporate credit spreads near all-time lows, before adding: “there actually is a lot of reasons to think that Bitcoin should have also already participated, but it didn’t.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash On Feb. 5 Was Historic: The Numbers Behind The Selloff That divergence, he argued, is why investors should stop leaning on backward-looking heuristics that have become psychological crutches. In his telling, crypto markets have repeatedly assumed history would re-run—altcoin rallies after bitcoin rallies, a durable four-year cycle, and the idea that QE or lower rates reliably lift BTC. “It’s worth remembering that there’s things that are constantly changing about the world where everything looks a little bit different than the way you had modeled it before,” he said. From there, Park reframed the debate around his “negative rho” versus “positive rho” Bitcoin framework. The former is the risk-asset version most investors recognize: rates down, risk up, Bitcoin up. The latter is the endgame: Bitcoin rising as rates rise, effectively challenging the notion of a stable “risk-free” rate by calling into question the credibility of the monetary order itself. “This is the mythical elusive perfect holy grail of what Bitcoin is meant to be,” Park said of positive-rho Bitcoin. “What it’s undermining is the risk-free rate itself. In that world, what we’re saying is actually because the risk-free rate is not the risk-free rate. Because the dollar hegemony is not the dollar hegemony and we are no longer able to price the yield curve in the ways we’ve known that means we need something different… and bitcoin is that hedge.” Park suggested the market may be inching toward that worldview as US policymaking becomes more explicitly about system repair, not incremental tweaks. He described the current US administration as attempting to “wrestle control of the economy away from the Federal Reserve” via deregulation, tax cuts, tariffs, and efforts to weaken the dollar, leaving the Fed “on their back foot” amid shifting “tectonic plates” across policy channels. Absolutely enjoyed recording this, even though we of course wish prices were higher. For those who have been listening to our show (monthly going forward), the fact that we are in a bear market won’t come as a big surprise. Still, Bitcoin can survive all this! Listen below 👇 https://t.co/JSrKOw5QLY — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) February 5, 2026 That’s where Park placed Warsh, a former Fed governor and, in Park’s telling, a rare combination of institutional fluency and technological conviction, as potentially pivotal. Park recounted an interaction from 2021 or 2022 in which Warsh expressed enthusiasm for Bitcoin while criticizing “phonies” who treat tech as “magic.” Warsh, Park said, “truly believed deep in his heart that this isn’t magic… that it actually is going to solve a lot of problems and bring efficiencies and Bitcoin is a core part of that cultural fabric.” Related Reading: PlanB Lays Out Four Bitcoin Bear-Market Scenarios Crucially, Park emphasized Warsh is not an anti-institution wrecking ball. Instead, he portrayed Warsh as someone who understands why the Fed’s legitimacy has been challenged and how it might be rebuilt. One line, Park said, has “always stuck” with him: “inflation is a choice.” Park contrasted that with Fed communication that, in his view, sometimes treats inflation as something that merely happens due to tariffs or war, rather than an outcome of policy tools and mandates. For Park, a Warsh appointment matters less because it guarantees easier policy and more because it could accelerate a rethink of Fed–Treasury coordination. He said he is “optimistic about the possibility of a new Fed Treasury accord that Bessant and Warsh can rewrite,” arguing the heart of the issue is the Triffin dilemma and the tension between the dollar’s external reserve role and internal saver role. “It’s not that we need fed independence,” Park said. “We actually need Fed interdependence with the Treasury.” The irony, in Park’s framing, is that “more accommodative policies may in fact actually not be the catalyst” for Bitcoin’s next bull phase. Instead, he argued Bitcoin’s bid ultimately strengthens when the world feels less like “peacetime” and more like “wartime”, when industrial, military, and fiscal policy dominate, centralization pressures rise, and capital controls become more plausible. The people who “need Bitcoin,” he said, are not US investors with endless alternatives, but those facing constraint and censorship. If Park is right, Warsh isn’t bullish for Bitcoin because he’ll deliver a familiar liquidity wave. He’s bullish because a Warsh-era Fed, paired with a Treasury aligned on system-level reform, could push markets toward the “positive rho” regime, where Bitcoin’s value proposition is less about riding stimulus and more about challenging the architecture that made stimulus necessary in the first place. At press time, BTC traded at $66,396. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Binance SAFU Fund Adds 3,600 Bitcoin ($233M) As Market Faces Pressure",
    "body": "Bitcoin has experienced one of its sharpest corrections in recent years, slipping below the $65,000 level and reaching its lowest price since October 2024. The decline reflects persistent selling pressure across the crypto market, accompanied by deteriorating macro sentiment, reduced liquidity, and cautious positioning among institutional participants. Recent price action suggests the market is entering a critical phase where confidence, rather than technical levels alone, may determine the next directional move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Deep In Loss: MVRV Signals Capitulation Phase Amid this uncertainty, the Binance SAFU Fund disclosed the purchase of an additional 3,600 BTC, valued at roughly $233.37 million. While such acquisitions do not guarantee a market reversal, they indicate continued strategic accumulation by major industry players even during periods of elevated volatility. Market sentiment has deteriorated markedly. Several sentiment indicators now sit near levels last observed during the 2022 bear market, when risk appetite contracted sharply and investors adopted defensive positioning. This environment typically coincides with reduced speculative activity, heightened caution among retail traders, and increased scrutiny from institutional capital. Institutional Accumulation Emerges Amid Prolonged Capitulation Phase Arkham data indicates that the Binance SAFU fund has continued accumulating Bitcoin, bringing its total recent purchases to approximately 6,230 BTC, valued near $434.5 million. While such activity signals ongoing participation from large institutional entities, it does not necessarily imply an imminent price recovery. Historically, significant purchases during corrective phases often occur alongside broader market stress rather than marking an immediate turning point. Current market conditions increasingly resemble a classic capitulation phase. Capitulation typically emerges when sustained price declines force weaker holders to exit positions, often at losses, leading to elevated exchange inflows, compressed liquidity, and sharp sentiment deterioration. These episodes can persist longer than many participants anticipate, particularly when macroeconomic uncertainty, risk-off positioning, and tightening liquidity conditions coincide. Importantly, capitulation does not follow a fixed timeline. In prior cycles, similar phases unfolded over weeks or even months before a durable bottom formed. During these periods, volatility tends to remain elevated, failed rallies are common, and confidence rebuilds gradually rather than abruptly. The key variables to monitor include exchange flows, derivatives leverage, spot demand recovery, and broader macro signals. Until those metrics stabilize, the base case remains continued market fragility. Large-scale accumulation by institutional funds may provide structural support, but it rarely prevents extended consolidation or further downside during capitulation environments.

Weekly Structure Shows Breakdown Below Key Support Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a clear deterioration in market structure after losing the $70K region, a level that had previously acted as both psychological and technical support. The latest candle reflects strong downside momentum, with price briefly touching the $60K zone before stabilizing near $65.9K. This move confirms a breakdown from the prior consolidation range and shifts focus toward whether this decline represents a deeper bear phase or a late-cycle correction. From a trend perspective, Bitcoin is now trading below the 50-week moving average while approaching the 100-week average. Historically, a critical dynamic support during corrective phases. The 200-week average remains far below, indicating the long-term macro trend has not fully reversed, although intermediate momentum has clearly weakened. Related Reading: Are We Near A Bitcoin Bear Market Bottom? History Offers A Framework Volume dynamics also matter here. The recent selloff shows rising participation compared with earlier consolidation periods, suggesting distribution rather than simple profit-taking. However, sustained high volume without further price acceleration downward could signal seller exhaustion. If Bitcoin fails to reclaim the $70K area, downside risk toward the $60K–$55K zone remains plausible. Conversely, stabilization above current levels would indicate absorption, a necessary precursor for any meaningful recovery. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Coinbase Premium Turns Positive Since Mid-January As Bitcoin Sees Price Relief",
    "body": "Amid a recent Bitcoin price rebound, Coinbase Premium data shows that American investors are renewing their bullish interest. Notably, the latest price relief only closes a negatively volatile trading week in which Bitcoin experienced a free price fall, as 30% loss pushed prices to around $60,000. This market plunge by the premier cryptocurrency has been attributed to many factors, including collapsing leverages, high levels of ETF outflows, metals market volatility, and also investors’ expectations in line with the typical boom and bust market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sell-Off May Be Done, Analyst Flags Recovery Signs Coinbase Premium Turns Positive After Successful $60K Retest The Coinbase Premium, one of the most important Bitcoin market indicators, shows the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and its price on other major exchanges. It is largely used to measure how much more or less US investors are paying to acquire Bitcoin compared to international traders. According to Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, the Coinbase premium has maintained a negative value since mid-January, suggesting that US traders valued the asset lower compared to their global counterparts, leading to a weak market demand. However, since Bitcoin bounced off the $60,000 support following the recent bloodbath, the American market participants have rediscovered their market confidence as indicated by a rising demand and corresponding movement of the Coinbase Premium into a positive zone. During this time, the flagship cryptocurrency has shown moderate resilience, climbing by over 16% to presently trade around $70,000. However, it is worth noting that the positive Coinbase Premium reading does not singularly confirm an impending full-scale recovery. Other factors need to be considered, including macroeconomic developments such as Federal Reserve interest rate decisions and liquidity tightening policies, overall global market sentiment, and geopolitical stability. Related Reading: Dogecoin Drops Below $0.09 as Market Weakness Outweighs Musk Hype Bitcoin Market Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $68,892, representing a 6.44% gain in the past day. However, significant losses of 17.34% and 23.38% on the weekly and monthly charts, respectively, show the asset is still deep in bearish territory. According to a recent post from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin has been about 50% away from its all-time high (ATH). Notably, recent bear markets recorded price slumps as low as 70%-80% indicating, indicating that there is a high possibility of a deeper price correction. However, CryptoQuant analysts warn that the bigger concern is time capitulation, i.e., how long this market winter will stay compared to how low prices may fall. With a market cap of $1.4 trillion, Bitcoin continues to account for over 55% of the total crypto market cap and is the largest digital asset in the world.

    "title": "Breathe… XRP Is The ‘Oxygen’ Of The New Financial System, CEO Says",
    "body": "XRP is being talked about in a different way now — not just as a token to trade, but as something that could plug into real finance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sell-Off May Be Done, Analyst Flags Recovery Signs The talk is shifting from ticker-watchers to companies that want reliable settlement rails and liquid collateral for on-chain assets. That shift shows up in moves on the ledger and in comments from people building businesses around it. XRP Seen As Financial Glue According to Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group, XRP should be thought of as foundational collateral rather than a short-term bet. He called it “the most pristine collateral” and warned that 99% of holders “have no clue” what they actually hold. Those are strong words, and they line up with wider signals from developers and some institutional players who are testing XRPL’s features for real-world use. 99% of people that own XRP have no clue what it really is…. It’s the most pristine collateral the world has ever seen… It’s the oxygen the new financial system will need to breathe.. I do not know how to impress upon you how important XRP will be for the world moving forward. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) February 4, 2026 Growing Tokenized Commodity Activity Reports say the XRPL now hosts roughly $1.14 billion in tokenized commodities. That number is important. It shows companies are putting things like energy-linked tokens and diamonds onto the ledger, and it positions XRPL just behind Ethereum in the specific area of tokenized commodity value. These assets aren’t just experiment tokens; they are intended to be tied to physical goods and cash flows, which changes how XRP might be used in settlement and collateral roles. Ripple’s Plan For Institutional DeFi Based on reports from Ripple’s roadmap, the ledger is being prepared for deeper institutional use. Permissioned domains and credentials are being highlighted as tools to let regulated firms operate with KYC and compliance baked in. XRP Price Action Market moves reacted to these developments. After a slide to about $1.11 amid broad market stress, XRP climbed back to roughly $1.53 on February 7, a move of over 35% from the recent low. Trading has since cooled off a little. Some traders point to renewed institutional flows and accumulation by large wallets, while others say global risk sentiment and macro headlines remain the main drivers of day-to-day swings. Institutional Steps Toward On-Chain Credit Meanwhile, reports note early institutional participants are preparing to put capital to work to increase yield and liquidity on XRPL. Planned features like a permissioned DEX, confidential transfers, and smarter escrow controls are meant to make the ledger easier for banks and regulated funds to plug into existing processes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Edges Past Gold In Appeal, JPMorgan Says XRP As ‘Oxygen’ If those pieces arrive and are adopted, XRP’s role as an on-ledger liquidity provider and settlement asset would be reinforced. There are good reasons to watch both the tech and the market. The ledger’s growing base of tokenized goods and the roadmap for lending give a clear use case for XRP as operational collateral. At the same time, price swings show that broader macro forces and speculation still matter a great deal, and adoption by banks and funds will be what really tests the claim that XRP can act as the “oxygen” for a new financial plumbing.

    "title": "Pundit Says It’s Time To Get Your XRP Off Crypto Exchanges – Here’s Why",
    "body": "XRP’s price crash earlier this week has kept many bullish investors in the XRP community on edge, but one outspoken voice in the community believes the move is not as random as it looks. A crypto pundit known as Stellar Rippler has encouraged XRP holders to pull their cryptocurrencies off centralized exchanges immediately, with the outlook that the recent volatility is not just another routine market dip but a warning sign of what’s to come. Related Reading: Bitcoin Edges Past Gold In Appeal, JPMorgan Says Engineered XRP Crash? Stellar Rippler’s position is based on the idea that XRP is being treated differently from most digital assets behind the scenes. He pointed to past remarks from David Schwartz, co-creator of the XRP Ledger, where XRP was described as a form of pre-allocated liquidity for institutional use, as well as statements suggesting that XRP currently held in escrow can be sold to institutions but will not be circulated until NDAs are disclosed. He went further to name large financial players, including BlackRock, JPMorgan, Bank of America, and institutions linked to the BRICS, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and European central banking structures. According to the pundit, all these institutions have bought the right to buy the XRP currently held in escrow by Ripple. At the time of writing, there are no public filings that confirm coordinated buying of XRP escrows by these entities, but the argument has found receptive ears among investors unsettled by the recent sell-off. From that angle, the pundit noted that sudden downside moves, such as the recent drop to $1.15, are engineered. By “engineered,” this means the price crash serves a strategic purpose of creating opportunity for large financial players to accumulate XRP at lower prices before any market repricing takes place. Should You Take Your XRP Off Exchanges? Another part of the warning focused on user experience at major crypto exchanges. According to the pundit, Binance and Coinbase users have reportedly been facing difficulties getting their crypto off the exchanges. This, in itself, is a warning for XRP holders to get their cryptos off crypto exchanges and into a cold wallet. That message taps into conversation in crypto about self-custody versus keeping holdings on crypto exchanges. Calls to be your own bank tend to resurface whenever price action turns volatile. The alarm was sounded against the backdrop of a Bitcoin price crash below $70,000 that pulled most cryptocurrencies lower. XRP, in particular, dipped to around $1.15 during the sell-off before rebounding. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sell-Off May Be Done, Analyst Flags Recovery Signs At the time of writing, XRP is trading near $1.42, easing some immediate pressure but not fully restoring confidence. On the subject of confidence, sentiment surrounding XRP on social media is relatively optimistic. Data shows XRP is drawing more positive commentary than other large-cap assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum despite the recent market-wide crash.

    "title": "Bitcoin Crash Linked To BlackRock IBIT Hedging, Arthur Hayes Claims",
    "body": "Arthur Hayes, co‑founder of BitMEX, has pointed to hedging tied to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as a major driver behind the recent Bitcoin sell‑off. Related Reading: Bitcoin Edges Past Gold In Appeal, JPMorgan Says According to Hayes, dealer hedging related to IBIT and similar structured products can force large, mechanical selling when markets move against those positions. Reports note that such moves can amplify a price drop already set off by other pressures. Heavy Hedges Can Trigger Sudden Selling Pressure: Hayes Hayes argues that banks and dealers who underwrite structured notes and ETF‑linked products often hedge their exposure in the spot and derivatives markets. Those hedges can be heavy and fast. When a large product faces outflows or redemption triggers, hedges are adjusted quickly. That can translate into sudden selling pressure that pushes prices down further, especially if liquidity is thin. $BTC dump probably due to dealer hedging off the back of $IBIT structured products. I will be compiling a complete list of all issued notes by the banks to better understand trigger points that could cause rapid price rises and falls. As the game changes, u must as well. pic.twitter.com/9DF8VE9XBL — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) February 7, 2026 Market Moves And Liquidity Stress The market behaved like a room of people trying to leave at once. Prices plunged, then bounced. Reports say Bitcoin fell steeply from its recent highs before staging a partial recovery. Bitcoin has fallen to around $68,500 Saturday, down 16% in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Trades and order books showed spikes in volume, which is one sign that hedging flows and quick rebalancing were at play. Some analysts say macro news and trader positioning also mattered. The truth likely sits in the overlap of these causes. Who Bears The Risk Dealers carry risk when they underwrite complex products. In certain moments, that risk is passed back into the market through hedging. That’s how, according to Hayes, a few large issuers can indirectly set off a chain reaction that affects many other holders and traders. The moves can be sudden and mechanical, not always driven by sentiment. A Watchful Washington Reports say the role of spot ETFs in crypto markets is now on regulators’ and policymakers’ radar. US President Donald Trump’s economic team has been monitoring big flows into and out of institutional vehicles, while market participants debate whether ETFs stabilize prices or add new stress points. Whatever the view, structured products now form a clear link between traditional finance and crypto volatility. Broader Takeaways This episode underlines how new financial plumbing can create new channels for contagion. Some see the presence of large, regulated players as a net positive for long‑term adoption. Others warn those same players introduce conventional market mechanics that can behave unpredictably when stretched. Reports note both perspectives are useful when piecing together why prices moved the way they did. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sell-Off May Be Done, Analyst Flags Recovery Signs Who Is Right, And What Next Hayes has laid out a theory that ties observable hedging flows to the crash. It is a compelling thread that fits many of the market signals seen in recent days. Still, other factors—macro shifts, concentrated profit‑taking, and liquidity gaps—likely played parts as well. Traders will watch flows closely, and structured product issuers will be asked hard questions. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "XRP Price Returns Above $1.5 — On-Chain Data Says Whales Are Behind It",
    "body": "The XRP price was on the verge of losing the $1 level merely two days ago, as the entire crypto market succumbed to an almost unprecedented level of volatility and bearish pressure. The altcoin fell to as low as $1.16, its lowest level since November 2024. While the general cryptocurrency market appears to be showing some signs of recovery, the XRP price activity has been particularly impressive since bottoming out at around the $1.15 mark. According to a prominent crypto analytics firm, below are the reasons behind the altcoin’s latest resurgence. Whale And Network Activity Throw XRP A Lifeline On Friday, February 6, popular blockchain firm Santiment took to the social media platform X to discuss the recent correction and the subsequent recovery experienced by the XRP price going into this weekend. With the strong volatility witnessed in the market, XRP seemed to be bound for $1 in that downward movement. Related Reading: Ethereum Coinbase Premium Drops To 2022 Bear-Market Levels: Capitulation Or Further Downside? Santiment said on X: Panic sellers should have stopped to notice the massive activity on the XRP Ledger as speculators were discussing whether the coin would fall below $1.00. However, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization briefly reclaimed the $1.5 level on Friday, signaling the return of fresh buying momentum to the market. According to Santiment, this XRP price jump might have been triggered by the group of large investors known as the whales. The latest on-chain data shows that an “obvious” whale accumulation took place while the XRP price headed for the bottom. Santiment data shows that about 1,389 $100,000 whale transactions occurred during the dip, the highest volume seen over the past four months. Meanwhile, activity on the XRP Ledger has been on the rise since the altcoin’s price fell to its lowest level in over a year. According to Santiment’s post on X, the amount of unique addresses on the blockchain saw a notable surge to 78,727 in just one 8-hour candle, its highest level in approximately six months. The crypto analytics noted that these occurrences are both significant to the potential price resurgence of any asset. With an uptick in whale demand and network activity, the XRP price could build the foundation required to return to a bullish structure. However, investors might want to approach the market with extreme caution, as a relief rally is not the strangest phenomenon in a bear market. XRP Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of XRP stands at around $1.46, reflecting an almost 25% jump in the past 24 hours. However, this single-day action is not enough to erase the past week’s losses, which still sit roughly over 16%.

    "body": "Crypto expert Tony Severino has opined that Bitcoin isn’t just showing signs of a yearly top but also that the BTC price may have hit a 16-year cyclical peak. This comes amid the flagship crypto’s recent crash to $60,000, which sparked fears of a bear market. Bitcoin May Be Showing Signs Of A Peak Amid BTC Price Crash To $60,000 In an X post, Severino alluded to the yearly Bitcoin chart, which he said looks like a 16-year cyclical peak rather than just a yearly top. The expert also outlined several reasons this appears to be a major cyclical top for the BTC price. First, he noted that the white candlesticks have been decreasing in size over time, while black candlesticks engulf more white candles with each appearance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Just Hit A 15-Year Trendline After The Crash, What This Means Furthermore, Severino highlighted the Doji at the top of a rising wedge pattern while the Evening Star is in progress, which is a bearish reversal signal for the BTC price. Meanwhile, the Fischer Transform is crossing bearish with divergence, and the Stochastic is crossing bearish after being rejected from 80. He added that Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is falling back below 70 after making it above this level on the highest timeframe chart. His analysis comes as the BTC price continues to decline, suggesting the crypto market may be in a bear market after topping last October. Bitcoin dropped to as low as $60,000 earlier this week, suffering its largest daily decline since the FTX collapse. Veteran trader Peter Brandt has also opined that Bitcoin is in a bear market, predicting that it could still drop to as low as $42,000 before it sees a bottom. Reason For The Recent BTC Crash BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has commented on the reason for this recent Bitcoin crash, suggesting that it was due to external factors rather than part of an ongoing bear market. In an X post, he stated that the BTC price dump was probably due to a dealer hedging off the back of BlackRock’s BTC ETF structured products. Notably, BlackRock’s IBIT saw a record trading volume of $10 billion on the day of this crash to $60,000. Related Reading: Here’s What To Expect If The Bitcoin Price Maintains Support Above $74,400 Hayes’ comment comes on the back of Bitcoin’s rebound above $70,000, with the flagship crypto recording one of its largest ever daily gains yesterday following the crash to $60,000. Galaxy Digital’s Head of Research, Alex Thorn, suggested that the drop to $60,000 may mark the bottom for the BTC price. This came as he noted that the 200-week MA, which is around $60,000, has historically been a strong entry point for long-term investors. At the time of writing, the BTC price is trading at around $70,000, up over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pngtree, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin Taker Buy Ratio Signals Peak Bearish Sentiment — Relief Soon?",
    "body": "The price of Bitcoin experienced one of the most bearish periods in its history over the past week, losing one crucial technical level after the other. According to data, the cryptocurrency market has seen $1 trillion worth of capital flow out since mid-January. With no doubt about the emergence of the bear season, investors are now approaching the market with greater skepticism and caution. One of the on-chain metrics highlighting this shift in behavior is the Bitcoin taker buy ratio, which has fallen to new lows. BTC Taker Buy Ratio Drops To 0.48 In a new Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, market analyst CryptoOnchain shared a fresh on-chain angle to the ongoing selling pressure in the Bitcoin market. This observation is based on the declining Taker Buy Ratio on Binance, the world’s largest centralized exchange by trading volume. Related Reading: Why The Market Cap Argument For XRP Price Not Reaching $10,000 Is ‘Flawed’ The Bitcoin Taker Buy Ratio is a sentiment indicator that estimates the proportion of trading volume owned by buyers against that of the sellers. Typically, values below 1 signal that taker sell volumes (aggressive selling) are outpacing taker buy volumes, which implies that sellers are overwhelming the buyers in the market. Highlighting data from CryptoQuant, CryptoOnchain revealed that the Bitcoin Taker Buy Ratio (14-day Moving Average) on Binance has dropped to 0.48, marking its lowest level since October 2025. Such a negative market sentiment on the world’s largest exchange spotlights a worrying trend in the general derivatives market. CryptoOnchain said: A drop to such a significant low suggests that sellers are overwhelmingly dominating the order book, aggressively hitting bids without sufficient buying resistance. As the crypto pundit also pointed out, this drop in the Bitcoin Taker Buy Ratio coincided with the recent price correction, which saw the premier cryptocurrency fall to around $61,000. CryptoOnchain noted that this metric needs to stabilize and begin to rise again if the BTC price is to see any relief. The Quicktake post concluded: For a potential reversal or a local bottom, we need to see this metric stabilize and begin to trend upwards, indicating that aggressive selling is exhausted and buyers are stepping back in. Until then, caution is advised as the momentum remains heavily in favor of the bears. Bitcoin Price At A Glance After one of the largest “red” days in the crypto market, the price of BTC appears to be recovering nicely, having returned above the $70,000 on Friday. As of this writing, the flagship cryptocurrency is valued at around $70,263, reflecting an over 11% price jump in the past 24 hours.

    "body": "Ethereum is quietly setting up for a potentially decisive move as the Libra formation remains active on the weekly chart. While confirmation is still pending, the structure has not been invalidated, keeping the upside scenario firmly on the table. With key resistance levels overhead and momentum beginning to stabilize, ETH may be entering a critical phase where the next major directional move starts to take shape. Weekly Libra Formation Keeps The Bullish Case Alive On the X platform, Kamile Uray highlighted that Ethereum is currently forming a Libra pattern on the weekly chart. With the weekly candle yet to close and no invalidation so far, the bullish formation remains active and continues to be a valid scenario.

Kamile Uray noted that a daily close above $2,475 would serve as the first technical signal that upside momentum is strengthening and that the recovery could continue. Failure to sustain movement above this area could delay further progress and keep the price vulnerable to pullbacks. Since the Libra formation is developing on the weekly timeframe, the pattern would only be considered invalid if Ethereum breaks below the $1,388 low, underscoring the broader, long-term nature of the setup. Ethereum Stretches Higher At $2,086 After A Sharp 22% Run According to Can Özsüer, Ethereum is currently trading around $2,086, marking a strong rally from the $1,730 area. From that level to the current price, ETH has surged roughly 22% without a meaningful correction, which increases the likelihood of short-term profit-taking. After such a sharp move, light selling pressure typically emerges as the market cools off. Related Reading: Analyst Says You’re Not Bullish Enough On Ethereum – What Does He Mean? Can Özsüer notes that any selling from this region is expected to remain controlled rather than aggressive. The ideal pullback zone lies between $1,950 and $2,000, where the price could reset without damaging the broader bullish structure. A dip into this range would be considered healthy and could set the stage for the next leg higher. Once that corrective move plays out, the next upside objective comes in around the $2,200 level. However, if price pushes straight toward the target without offering a pullback, the strategy would need adjustment. In that scenario, chasing a long position becomes less attractive, as a stronger selling wave could follow once the target is reached. If a correction does materialize, Can Özsüer suggests that a long position on the pullback would be the preferred approach. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com",
