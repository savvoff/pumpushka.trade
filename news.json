    "title": "Historical Pattern From 2017 Signals Bitcoin Price Crash To $35,000",
    "body": "Bitcoin is still playing out a series of price actions that look like they may be entering a deeper correction phase. A technical analysis shared on social media platform X by crypto analyst Chiefy suggests that Bitcoin is repeating the macro structures seen after the 2017 and 2021 cycle tops. If the pattern continues to unfold with similar symmetry, the projection is that Bitcoin could fall to as low as $35,000 within days. Bitcoin Imitating 2017 And 2021 Cycle Structures Chiefy’s chart compares three major peaks: the $21,000 high in 2017, the $69,000 peak in 2021, and the recent all-time high just above $126,000. The important trend is that in both of the first two cases, Bitcoin experienced severe retracements exceeding 70% before eventually finding long-term bottoms. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Crash Toward $60,000 Was “Necessary” The first retracement kicked off just after Bitcoin broke above $21,000 in 2017, when it fell 84% during the 2018 bear market. After the $69,000 peak in 2021, the decline reached about 77%. Chiefy described the fractal alignment as nearly perfect, raising the possibility that the market could be approaching another capitulation phase similar to past cycles. The current correction from $126,000 is beginning to resemble those earlier downturns in structure. If Bitcoin were to repeat a similar percentage drop, price projections would place the cryptocurrency in the $30,000 to $35,000 range. The analyst goes even further, warning that such a move could unfold within the next 10 days if the pattern were to play out as it did before. Weak ETF Demand And Whale Inflows Adding To Bearish Pressure Various on-chain data are pointing to a cautious outlook among crypto investors. According to Glassnode, the 30-day simple moving average of net flows for both Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs has been negative for most of the last 90 days. This shows that there is currently no clear sign of demand strong enough to absorb the persistent selling pressure. Related Reading: Important Bitcoin Macro Cycle Durations You Should Know About Interestingly, CryptoQuant’s Whales Inflow Signal metric shows that the average monthly inflows of BTC to Binance from whales increased massively as Bitcoin fell from $95,000 to $60,000. These inflows rose from around 1,000 BTC in late January to nearly 3,000 BTC in February, with a notable spike of roughly 12,000 BTC on February 6 alone. Since February 1, seven trading days have recorded more than 5,000 BTC in daily inflows from this group of large investors. This type of movement shows an intensification of transfers to exchanges from large Bitcoin holders into Binance, a trend that undoubtedly contributed to the price crash. This is because rising exchange inflows are a reflection of increasing selling pressure. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $66,015, down by 1.7% in the past 24 hours.

    "title": "After 95% Crash, Avalanche Forms High-Timeframe Reversal Structure",
    "body": "After enduring a brutal 95%+ drawdown from its 2021 peak, Avalanche is now showing early signs of a potential high-timeframe reversal. With price stabilizing at macro support and forming an emerging Elliott Wave structure on the weekly chart, the current phase could mark a critical turning point in the broader cycle. Weekly Elliott Wave Structure Signals Macro Inflection AVAX is currently forming an Elliott Wave structure on the weekly chart, trading within a massive descending channel that has remained intact since the 2021 all-time high. The broader structure suggests the asset is still operating within a long-term corrective phase, but key technical signals now point to a potential higher-timeframe inflection point. Related Reading: Avalanche Shows Signs Of Recovery As Key Indicator Flashes A Buy Signal – Details According to Crypto Patel, after enduring a brutal 95%+ cycle correction, Avalanche appears to have completed Wave 1 with a macro low near $5.67. Price is now transitioning into the early stages of a Wave 2 recovery phase, a critical moment in the Elliott Wave sequence that often determines whether a sustainable expansion phase can follow. Structurally, the weekly chart shows several notable developments. Wave 1 seems to have finalized within the $8–$5 macro bottoming zone, establishing a potential base of support. At the same time, price continues to trade within the long-term descending channel that has defined the broader downtrend. Technically, the chart reflects a clean bearish breakdown followed by a retest of the lower trendline, a classic deviation setup. Additionally, AVAX executed a liquidity sweep into the weekly demand zone between $8 and $7. Meanwhile, the overall fractal structure also mirrors the compression phase seen in the previous cycle before expansion. For confirmation, Crypto Patel emphasizes the need for sustained weekly strength and expansion back toward mid-channel resistance. A decisive push in that direction would strengthen the bullish Wave 2 thesis and signal that the larger recovery structure is beginning to unfold. Avalanche Upside Roadmap: $33 To $147 In Focus CryptoPatel outlines an ambitious upside roadmap for Avalanche, projecting sequential targets at $33, $58, $97, and ultimately $147. Should the broader channel expansion scenario play out into 2026–2027, price could trend toward the upper boundary of the multi-year descending channel. From the macro bottom to the final target, that would represent an estimated 2,489% expansion. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Defies Bear Market With Explosive On‑Chain Growth, Messari The bullish thesis remains intact as long as Avalanche holds above $5.50 on a weekly final support, which marks the Wave 1 low and last major structural support. Maintaining this level preserves the higher-timeframe recovery structure and keeps the Wave 2 continuation scenario in play. However, a confirmed weekly close below $5.50 would invalidate the setup and signal structural weakness. As it stands, this remains a high-timeframe, patience-driven opportunity with asymmetric risk-to-reward, a framework best suited for spot accumulation and long-term holders.

    "title": "Ethereum Derivatives Reset Raises Questions About Next Price Move: What Happens Next?",
    "body": "Ethereum continues to struggle below the $2,000 level, reflecting persistent selling pressure and increasingly fragile market sentiment. The inability to reclaim this psychological threshold has kept traders defensive, with volatility elevated and confidence weakened as negative sentiment spreads across the broader crypto market. While corrections are not unusual after strong cycles, the current environment shows clear signs of stress, with investors closely watching liquidity conditions and derivatives positioning for clues about the next directional move. Related Reading: Bitcoin BCMI Drops Toward Bear Market Territory: How Close Is BTC To A Real Buy Zone? A recent CryptoQuant report provides additional context by highlighting a significant contraction in Ethereum futures open interest. Data tracking the 30-day change in net open interest across major trading platforms indicates that the derivatives market is undergoing a clear phase of deleveraging and risk readjustment. The decline appears concentrated on key exchanges such as Binance, Gate.io, OKX, and Bybit, pointing to a widespread outflow of capital from leveraged positions. According to the figures, Binance alone recorded an approximate drop of 40 million ETH in open interest over the past month, while Gate.io saw a decline exceeding 20 million ETH. OKX posted a reduction of nearly 6.8 million ETH, with Bybit contributing roughly 8.5 million ETH, bringing the combined contraction across these platforms to around 75 million ETH. Broad Deleveraging Suggests Ethereum Market Reset The CryptoQuant report further notes that when additional platforms showing negative open interest readings are included — even those with comparatively smaller volumes — the total contraction across all exchanges exceeds 80 million ETH over the past 30 days. This confirms that the deleveraging trend is not isolated to a handful of major venues but represents a broader structural shift across the Ethereum derivatives ecosystem. Such a widespread decline in open interest typically indicates that traders, particularly those relying on leverage, are reducing exposure rather than initiating new speculative positions. This behavior may reflect caution following heightened volatility or pressure from recent price declines that triggered margin adjustments. Historically, similar environments tend to emerge during transitional market phases, when speculative momentum cools, and risk management becomes a priority. From a structural standpoint, this type of contraction can function as a market “clean-up.” By gradually removing weaker leveraged positions, the likelihood of sudden liquidation cascades may diminish over time. While this does not guarantee an immediate recovery, flushing out excess leverage often stabilizes market conditions. In Ethereum’s case, the ongoing reset in derivatives positioning could help establish a firmer price base if broader liquidity conditions and investor sentiment begin to stabilize. Related Reading: Ethereum Endures Historic Liquidation Week: Largest Sustained Liquidation Phase Since 2021 Ethereum Faces Structural Pressure Below Key Weekly Support Ethereum’s weekly chart shows persistent downside pressure after losing the $2,000 level, a zone that previously acted as both psychological support and a technical pivot during prior consolidation phases. The recent breakdown places ETH below several major moving averages, which now function as overhead resistance rather than support, indicating weakening bullish momentum and a shift toward a more defensive market structure. Price action reflects a clear rejection from the $3,000–$3,500 region earlier in the cycle, followed by a sequence of lower highs. This pattern typically signals a corrective or transitional phase rather than a continuation of the prior bullish trend. The latest decline has also been accompanied by elevated trading volume, suggesting distribution and deleveraging rather than organic accumulation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Losses Hit Luna Crash Levels — But Price Context Points To A Different Market Phase From a structural standpoint, the next meaningful support area appears near the $1,600–$1,700 range, where prior consolidation and demand previously emerged. Holding this zone would help maintain the broader long-term framework despite current weakness. A sustained break below it, however, could increase the probability of a deeper retracement phase. Ethereum remains highly sensitive to macro liquidity conditions, derivatives positioning, and overall crypto market sentiment, with recovery dependent on renewed demand and stabilization above key technical levels.

    "title": "Bitcoin Flirts With ‘Undervalued’ As MVRV Slides Toward 1",
    "body": "Bitcoin is nearing a level on the MVRV ratio that historically lines up with market “undervaluation,” according to CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Dan, as traders look for signs that a four-month drawdown from October 2025’s all-time high is shifting from distribution into accumulation. Is Bitcoin Undervalued? In a post on X, Korean Dan said Bitcoin is “approaching the undervalued zone,” arguing that the market is getting close to a threshold that has often marked compelling risk-reward for longer-horizon buyers. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Leading On-Chain Analyst Sees A Floor Forming “After reaching its all-time high in October 2025, Bitcoin has been declining for approximately 4 months and is now approaching the undervalued zone,” he wrote. “Generally speaking, when the MVRV ratio falls below 1, Bitcoin is considered to be undervalued. The current value is around 1.1, which can be seen as being close to the undervalued zone.” The MVRV framing matters because the metric has tended to compress toward 1 around prior cycle lows. The chart shared alongside the post shows the ratio at roughly 1.10, with earlier sub-1.0 dips highlighted around past bottoming windows. Crypto Dan cautioned that traders shouldn’t assume the current setup will rhyme perfectly with prior drawdowns, specifically because the preceding advance looked different on valuation measures. “ However, unlike previous cycles, it is necessary to recognize that in this cycle, Bitcoin did not sharply rise all the way into the overvalued zone during the uptrend,” he wrote. “Accordingly, the pattern of the decline may also appear differently from the previous bottom zones, so it seems prudent to prepare for that possibility in our response.” That caveat became the focal point of a short back-and-forth in replies. One user, onlyus8x, suggested that if Bitcoin reached this cycle’s prior all-time high more than three times faster than before, the downturn could also resolve faster—“might the winter also pass 3 times faster?” Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Luna-Level Capitulation Signal at $67K, Not $19K Crypto Dan pushed back on a simple speed analogy, replying: “Because there are differences from your past, I personally set the criteria differently from past decline cycles by comprehensively judging these things as well.” Mayer Multiple And The 200-Week MA A separate post from analyst Will Clemente pointed to two long-watched, price-based benchmarks that are also pressing into historically constructive ranges. “Throughout Bitcoin’s life span we have seen two indicators continue to be the best global market bottom signals: The Mayer multiple (distance from 200 day moving average) and the 200 week moving average,” Clemente wrote. “Both of these are clearly in long term accumulation territory.” The charts he shared show a Mayer Multiple around 0.60, alongside a backtest table that flags prior instances when the indicator fell to roughly that level. The same image placed Bitcoin’s 200-week moving average near $57,926, with Bitcoin shown about 15% above it and a note that it has “not yet touched” that line in the current drawdown. At press time, BTC traded at $67,277. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin NUPL Back In Hope/Fear Region: What Happens Next?",
    "body": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) has plunged recently. Here’s what this could mean for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin NUPL Has Dropped To The 0.18 Level In a new post on X, o-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin NUPL, which is an indicator that compares the amount of unrealized profit and loss held by investors on the BTC blockchain. The metric works by going through the transaction history of each token on the network to find the price at which they were last involved in a transfer. If this previous selling price is greater than the current spot price for any coin, then that particular token is assumed to be carrying some net unrealized profit. Similarly, the cost basis being lower implies the token is underwater. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Heatmap Shows All Major Metrics In The Red The exact amount of profit/loss held by a coin is equal to the difference between the two prices. The NUPL sums up this value for each category and then subtracts it to determine the net situation for the network. Additionally, it also divides the result by the market cap to showcase how the net profit/loss among investors looks relative to the asset’s total valuation. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NUPL over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NUPL shot up above the 0.5 level during the rallies in 2024 and 2025. This suggests that investors were carrying net profits more than half as much as the cryptocurrency’s market cap. These phases of euphoria were followed by price declines that took the metric into the zone between 0.25 and 0.5. BTC managed to recover from the first two of these drops, but the latest one has been followed by an extended phase of downtrend. From the chart, it’s visible that this bearish action has taken the cryptocurrency to a value of 0.18. This level indicates that profits are still dominant on the network, but they are much thinner than before. The level lies inside a region that the analytics firm defines as pertaining to “hope/fear” among the investors. “This regime tends to be reactive: rallies meet sell pressure, and downside can extend as conviction fades,” explained the analytics firm. The last time that the Bitcoin NUPL saw a substantial drawdown into the region was during the 2022 bear market. Back then, the cryptocurrency ended up traveling right through the zone and into the extreme fear area below the zero level, corresponding to net losses being held by the majority of investors.

    "title": "Solana Reclaims $80 Amid Friday Market Bounce – Analysts Set Next Targets",
    "body": "As the crypto market recovers, Solana (SOL) has bounced from a major level trendline and momentarily reclaimed a key horizontal level. Some analysts have signaled that a retest of a crucial short-term resistance could be coming, while others have warned that a breakdown to new lows remains possible. Related Reading: Ethereum $1,900 Retest Could Decide Next Major Move – Is ETH Preparing For New Lows? Solana Bounces From Two-Year Trendline On Friday, Solana bounced 10.3% to break past the $85 area for the first time in three days. The cryptocurrency has been hovering between $78-$88 over the past week, briefly falling to $67 during last Thursday’s correction. SOL lost the mid-zone of its local range after recent market volatility, falling below $80 on Thursday. However, Today’s rebound has sent the altcoin above these recently lost levels, setting the stage for a potential recovery. Amid this performance, market observer Daan Crypto Trades highlighted that the cryptocurrency has reclaimed the key $80 level, which has historically served as major resistance and support. To the trader, the Solana must hold above this area and form a base above it before “watching for a low-timeframe market structure break back to bullish.” Analyst Ali Martinez observed that sustained buying pressure could push SOL’s price toward the $88 level, not seen since the start of the week. The altcoin has been unable to break above this level since last week’s breakdown, becoming a key short-term resistance area. A breakout from this level could open the door for a retest of the $90-$96 zone, where the April 2025 lows are. Meanwhile, Crypto Batman noted that Solana is retesting its two-year descending trendline in the weekly timeframe, located around the recent lows. The chart shows that the macro trendline has been holding since early 2024 and has been tapped multiple times throughout the cycle. As the analyst explained, “Over the past 2 years, every time the price touches this level, a massive reversal occurs.” During this period, it has also marked the bottom of each major correction, with the latest retest taking place in Q2 2025 and leading to the following quarter’s rally. SOL Breakdown Still Coming? Despite the bullish outlooks, other market watchers have shared potential bearish forecasts for Solana if momentum weakens. Altcoin Sherpa warned that SOL could drop to $50 if selling pressure pushes the price below a crucial area. The chart shows that after losing the 200-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), around the $121 mark, and the April 2025 lows, the key area to hold is the recently visited local range lows. As the analyst displayed, if the cryptocurrency fails to hold the $77-$78 price area, the next major historical support sits near the November 2023 breakout area, around the $51 mark. Market watcher Crypto Bullet suggested that Solana’s bottom may not be in yet, arguing that “those who bought BTC above $80k and SOL above $120 must stay trapped for a year or two.” Related Reading: LayerZero (ZRO) Soars 40% Amid Zero Blockchain Debut, Major Institutional Backing He affirmed that “returning to those levels anytime soon doesn’t make sense,” as the cryptocurrencies are in their markdown period. In an X post, he emphasized the market cycle phases, pointing out that the accumulation phase occurred between 2022 and 2023, while the distribution phase occurred between 2024 and the start of 2026. Based on this, the analyst’s chart shows that SOL could potentially find a bottom around the $40 area.

    "title": "Bitcoin Funding Rate Falls To Critical Level — Short Squeeze Incoming?",
    "body": "After a dour performance throughout the week, the price of Bitcoin experienced a fair amount of bullish impetus on Friday, February 13th. Going into the weekend, the premier cryptocurrency seemed on its way to reclaim the psychologically relevant $70,000 level. Interestingly, recent on-chain data shows that this latest bullish spurt might be the start of, at least, a short-term rally for the Bitcoin price. Is Bitcoin On The Verge Of A Short Squeeze? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, market analyst CryptoOnchain revealed that the Bitcoin Funding Rate on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has dropped to a critically low level — one not seen in over a year. The relevant indicator here is the 14-day Simple Moving Average (SMA-14) of BTC Funding Rate. Related Reading: Ethereum Derivatives Reset Raises Questions About Next Price Move: What Happens Next? Typically, the Funding Rate metric estimates the periodic fee paid by traders in a derivatives market for a particular cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, in this case). When the funding rate is in the positive territory, it usually implies that the long traders (investors with buy positions) are paying a fee to short traders (investors with sell positions) in the derivatives market. On the flip side, a negative funding rate metric, as is the case currently, suggests that the payment is going from the short traders to the long traders. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the 14-day SMA of the Bitcoin Funding Rate on Binance has fallen to -0.002, its lowest level since September 2024. As CryptoOnchain rightly noted, a deeply negative funding rate, especially one that lasts over a 14-day average, indicates that bears (short traders) are increasingly betting against the premier cryptocurrency. The market analyst noted that these extremely negative values often correlate with the bottom of severe downward trends. CryptoOnchain wrote in the post: From an on-chain and market psychology perspective, deeply negative funding rates often serve as a strong Contrarian Signal. The market currently appears to be heavily “overcrowded” on the short side. From a historical perspective, this on-chain trend has often set the stage for a potent short squeeze, where a minor price rebound could trigger a cascade of liquidations of the mounting short positions. This cascade of short liquidations often serves as jet fuel, further propelling the Bitcoin price to the upside. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $69,000, reflecting an over 5% jump in the past 24 hours.

    "body": "Michael Saylor’s latest message is blunt and direct: “Go Bitcoin today — the money won’t fix itself.” He’s pressing an idea he has pushed for years — that holding Bitcoin is a deliberate choice against the slow decline of fiat money — and his firm’s actions back up the words. Bitcoin sits below Saylor’s firm’s average purchase price, yet buying has continued. Related Reading: Calm Down: Ethereum Has Survived 8 Major 50% Falls, Lee Reminds Investors Strategy’s Massive Position According to reports, Strategy now holds 714,644 BTC. The average cost of that stash is listed at $76,056 per coin. Recent filings show another 1,142 BTC was bought this month at about $78,815 each, a purchase that amounted to roughly $90 million. At today’s trading levels near $68,000, the position shows an estimated unrealized loss of close to $6 billion, while the reported book value of holdings tops $54 billion after nearly six years of steady accumulation. Go bitcoin today. The money won’t fix itself. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) February 13, 2026 Public companies together are reported to hold about 1.13 million BTC, and Strategy makes up almost two-thirds of that total. Reports note that close to 200 public firms hold some Bitcoin, though most of the new buying in January was concentrated in a very small group. One company leads the herd by a large margin. High-Conviction Buying Saylor’s message isn’t just rhetoric. Reports have disclosed that Strategy follows a long-range plan that includes a seven-year road map disclosed in its Q4 2025 filings, which aims to raise Bitcoin per share by 2032 based on various yield scenarios. The firm’s playbook is simple: buy on dips and avoid selling. The mantra is repeated: buy Bitcoin and do not sell. That posture has consequences. Some see it as a show of commitment that can encourage other firms and big investors to act similarly. Others view the heavy concentration of corporate exposure as a source of market fragility — if Strategy were to change course unexpectedly, prices could shift fast. Liquidity matters. That risk is understated when the focus is only on conviction. Related Reading: XRP Set To Dethrone Bitcoin Within 6 Years, Entrepreneur Says Market Impact And Criticism Reports say the firm’s buying has been so large that it dominated corporate additions in January, accounting for more than 90% of net new corporate Bitcoin purchases that month. That level of dominance brings scrutiny. Questions have been raised about governance, balance sheet risk, and what long-term holding means for shareholders who expect stable returns. Some critics argue that a company piling into a volatile asset creates a mismatch with traditional corporate responsibilities. At the same time, supporters argue that patient ownership of Bitcoin can protect against long-term currency erosion. This is the case Saylor makes: losses on paper are temporary if the thesis holds, and time is an ally for those convinced of Bitcoin’s store-of-value case.

    "title": "Bitcoin SuperTrend Signal That Preceded Last 60% Correction Resurfaces",
    "body": "Over the past week, the Bitcoin price kept on putting in consecutive lows, with barely any hopes in sight for a bullish reversal. However, on Friday, February 13th, the flagship cryptocurrency saw an upward momentum boost, where its value subsequently grew by 5.4%. While this may have been good for short-term traders (specifically scalpers), a troubling future seems to be lying in wait for the premier cryptocurrency. This bearish prognosis is based on a recent technical evaluation of the Bitcoin price. SuperTrend Indicator Flashes Sell Sign On BTC Monthly Timeframe In a 14 February post on social media platform X, influential technical analyst Ali Martinez revealed that the Bitcoin market could soon experience a significant macro trend shift. This hypothesis is based on the SuperTrend Indicator, which is a technical tool that indicates whether an asset (in this case, Bitcoin) is in an uptrend or in a downtrend. Related Reading: Solana Reclaims $80 Amid Friday Market Bounce – Analysts Set Next Targets This indicator plots a trailing level that acts as dynamic support when the price is in an uptrend, or resistance when in a downtrend. When the price is above the SuperTrend line, the market is considered to be in an uptrend; while when the price is below the line, on the other hand, it indicates that the market is in a downtrend. When a candle closes decisively beneath the dynamic trend line when previously in an uptrend, it indicates that the market has now flipped bearish, and vice versa. Interestingly, on the monthly timeframe, the candle now trades beneath the SuperTrend line, indicating that the market may be leaning bearish. Interestingly, the current setup shares semblance with past cycle transitions. From the chart shared by the analyst, it is clear that Bitcoin’s macro structure has gone through a series of expansions and deep retracements. These retracements were also properly illustrated on the indicator in their early stages. Before the late 2014-2015, the 2018, and the 2022 bear markets, the SuperTrend Indicator flashed a sell signal, after which the market entered a bearish phase. Considering the sell signal was seen on Bitcoin’s monthly chart, this could be a sign that the retracement here might be long-term, as expected in a typical bear market. However, it is worth noting that the present market dynamics are very different from previous cycles, as institutions are more involved and ETFs have expanded investor horizons. Hence, these underlying changes might play a role in the present cycle. If the sell signal from the SuperTrend indicator aligns with on-chain activity and macro events, and Bitcoin manages to close beneath the SuperTrend line, a bear market would likely follow, one where Bitcoin’s devaluation by at least 60% may be seen. On the other hand, if new demand enters the Bitcoin market, and the flagship cryptocurrency demonstrates resilience, the current signal could become a short-term warning, rather than a bear-market signal. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, Bitcoin holds a valuation of about $68,984, reflecting a 4.5% price jump in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has shrunk in value by approximately 29% on the monthly timeframe.
