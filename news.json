    "title": "Monad Price To Crash 99%? BitMEX Co-Founder Calls Protocol Another Berachain",
    "body": "The Layer 1 blockchain Monad has grabbed the headlines in the past few days following its successful launch earlier last week. MON, its native token, enjoyed a significant 80% surge on the back of the launch, hitting an all-time high of 0.048 on Wednesday, November 26. While the Monad protocol has enjoyed significant attention since going live, it appears that not everyone is confident in its potential adoption. Most notably, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has put forward a pessimistic outlook for the project, saying its token value could fall as much as 99%. Monad Has No Real Use Case: Hayes In a YouTube interview with Altcoin Daily, Hayes stated that any other Layer 1 blockchain besides Ethereum and Solana is “zero” and is not going to do very well. Using Monad as an example, the former BitMEX CEO described the protocol’s coin as another “high FDV, low-float” token. Related Reading: Solana Braces For A Dual-Test Setup – Here’s What Could Happen Next Hayes said that Monad is going to be the new “Berachain” and expects its native token’s value to fall by 99% after the initial jump. Berachain, which launched in February 2025, has its native token BERA trading beneath $1, nearly 94% beneath its all-time high of $14.83. As of this writing, the Monad token is valued at around $0.0285, reflecting an over 40% decline since hitting its all-time high on Wednesday. Hayes highlighted that every new project’s token often enjoys an early price spike before facing a deep correction, as there is usually no real use case to back up the initial growth. The crypto founder noted that it is a classic case of FOMO (fear of missing out), especially after the massive success of Ethereum. Hayes said in the interview: Every coin gets their first pump and people want to believe in the new L1. Everybody wants to invest in the new Ethereum like they would have in 2014 when everyone missed it. Me included. But again, that doesn’t mean it [Monad] is going to actually have any real use case. Moving forward, Hayes went on to pick a “magnificent five” of protocols currently in the cryptocurrency space, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, ZCash, and Ethena. If Not Layer 1s, What Next? It is little surprise that ZCash made it to the BitMEX co-founder’s list of top blockchain protocols. According to Hayes, ZCash and other privacy-focused coins—like Monero—will dominate the crypto narrative even more in the coming year. Related Reading: Ethereum Fusaka Will Be ‘The Most Bullish Upgrade’ Ever, Pundit Claims Additionally, Hayes mentioned that Zero Knowledge (ZK) proofs and quantum resistance are other crypto narratives to watch out for in 2026. Specifically, the crypto founder noted that the next winner in the crypto market over the next one to two years would come from the ZK space. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "BlackRock Exec Says Bitcoin ETFs Becoming A Major Revenue Source Was A ‘Big Surprise’",
    "body": "Spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are one of the biggest narratives and have been a game-changer in the cryptocurrency space in the past two years. With these investment products, people get to participate in the cryptocurrency market without having to directly own the digital assets. Interestingly, one of the biggest winners—that often gets overlooked—has been the issuers, especially as the crypto industry has seen increased institutional adoption since the Bitcoin ETFs launched. According to the firm’s executive, the BTC exchange-traded funds becoming the major source of revenue for BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was not envisioned. BlackRock’s Bitcoin Funds Outweighing Expectations At the Blockchain Conference 2025 in São Paulo on Friday, November 28, BlackRock’s business development director in Brazil, Cristiano Castro, told reporters that the Bitcoin ETFs are the largest revenue source for their company. According to the executive, this development came as a “big surprise” to the asset management firm. Related Reading: Fed To End QT In December: Will Bitcoin Mirror The Massive Price Crash From Last Time? Castro said in a statement: We were very optimistic when we launched, but we didn’t believe it would reach such proportions. Just to give you an idea, it [IBIT in the US and IBIT39 in Brazil – the asset’s reference names] came very close to US$100 billion [in allocation]. This feat is notable for the Bitcoin ETFs, especially considering that BlackRock offers more than 1,400 exchange-traded products globally and has a whopping $13.4 trillion in assets under management. The US-based Bitcoin fund (with the IBIT ticker) has over $70.7 billion in net assets, becoming the first ETF to reach the $70-billion mark (doing so in June 2025). While the US Bitcoin ETF market has somewhat slowed down, BlackRock’s IBIT still continues to outpace other ETFs launched in recent years. As earlier reports suggested, IBIT had managed to generate roughly $245 million in annual fees as of October 2025. Bitcoin ETF Outflows ‘Perfectly Normal’ – Castro When asked about the recent outflows from BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF as the market leader’s value fell, the director stated that there are zero surprises in that trend. “ETFs are very liquid and powerful instruments, and they serve precisely to allow people to allocate their capital and manage their cash flow,” Castro noted. The BlackRock director said that the withdrawals are expected, considering that the product is heavily owned by retail investors, who are reactionary in nature to price corrections. On Friday, the iShares Bitcoin Trust saw a net outflow of $113.72 million, bringing the weekly record to a negative $137.01 million and the fund to its fifth-consecutive week of withdrawals.

    "title": "This Analyst Predicted The PIPPIN Price Surge, Here’s The Rest Of The Prediction",
    "body": "Despite the bearish trend that has dominated the crypto market, the meme coin PIPPIN has stood out, flying green while others stalled. Over the weekend, the meme coin emerged as one of the top gainers, rising by more than 50% and doubling its value in only a few days. Interestingly, one crypto analyst had previously called out the PIPPIN rally, predicting that the price would rise. But even with the major rally so far, the analyst’s total prediction is yet to play out completely. The Breakout That Started It All In the analysis, Edoardo Telve points to the first breakout that began all of this for the PIPPIN price. This had come after the meme coin had suffered an extended accumulation range, which began back in March, lasting for seven months in total. This allowed the meme coin to form a structural bottom that allows for the kind of expansion that it has seen so far.

Amid this, there have been a number of areas of interest that have emerged, and the price staying above them suggests that the bullish trend continues to hold. The analyst refers to these levels as the 4EMA cluster, ranging between $0.02, $0.03, and $0.05. As long as the price remains above these levels, it means that the PIPPIN will maintain its strong upward momentum. Where Is The PIPPIN Price Headed? So far, the PIPPIN price has expanded rapidly, rising over 400% in the last week. The Sunday rally saw it touch above $0.19, stopping just short of $0.2. Despite this impressive rally, the analyst says the best may be yet to come. Related Reading: XRP Price At A Critical Turning Point: Analyst Maps Out Simple Rules For Breakout Telve points to factors such as the rising volume, strong impulsive candles, and lack of sharp rejection wicks as indications that the current rally is being driven by buyers as opposed to this being a liquidity grab. The PIPPIN price has also put in higher lows and maintained support above key resistance levels, as well as holding above the 4EMA stack pointed out by the analyst. As the meme coin continues to maintain the current expansion phase, the analyst believes that $0.3-$0.32 remains the final target. Interestingly, this level is historically a large supply zone, suggesting that this is where the sell-offs might begin in full bloom. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "XRP Hit By Violent 59% Leverage Flush As Speculators Slam The Brakes",
    "body": "XRP’s derivatives market has undergone a marked regime shift, with leverage collapsing and funding normalising in a way that signals a clear retreat from aggressive speculative positioning. The strongest evidence comes from Glassnode’s latest post on November 30, which frames the current phase as a structural, not merely tactical, pause in XRP leverage. XRP Derivatives Unwind Accelerates “XRP’s futures OI has fallen from 1.7B XRP in early October to 0.7B XRP (~59% flush-out). Paired with the funding rate dropping from ~0.01% to 0.001% (7D-SMA), 10/10 marked a structural pause in XRP speculators’ appetite to bet aggressively on upside,” Glassnode’s CryptoVizArt wrote on X. Open interest at 1.7 billion XRP in early October reflected a heavily leveraged market, with large notional positions stacked in futures and perpetuals. The subsequent collapse to 0.7 billion XRP implies that around one billion XRP of derivatives exposure has been closed, liquidated, or otherwise unwound. Such a reduction is not just a marginal trimming of risk; it is a wholesale deleveraging that strips out a large part of the speculative layer sitting on top of the spot market. Related Reading: XRP Flashes ‘Classic Accumulation Sign’ — Major Breakout Soon? The funding-rate move is equally telling. A 7-day SMA around 0.01% had previously indicated a consistent long bias, with traders willing to pay a recurring fee to maintain leveraged upside exposure. The compression to roughly 0.001% pushes funding close to neutral. In perpetual futures, that transition typically occurs when demand for leveraged longs fades and the market no longer tolerates a meaningful premium to hold long positions. Glassnode’s description of October 10 crash as the point that “marked a structural pause” captures this shift in regime: the market moved from persistent long crowding to a far more cautious, balanced stance. The November 30 post sits on top of a broader context Glassnode has been documenting through November. Related Reading: Analyst Teases $7.50 XRP Moonshot But Only After A Final Flush In November 8, the firm highlighted how profit taking has behaved during the recent drawdown: “Unlike previous profit realization waves that aligned with rallies, since late September, as XRP fell from $3.09 (~25%) to $2.30, profit realization volume (7D-SMA) surged by ~240%, from $65M/day to $220M/day. This divergence underscores distribution into weakness, not strength.” Rather than de-risking into strength, profitable holders have been realizing gains as price fell, reinforcing the deleveraging signalled by futures data. On November 17, Glassnode turned to supply dynamics, noting that “the share of XRP supply in profit has fallen to 58.5%, the lowest since Nov 2024, when price was $0.53. Today, despite trading ~4× higher ($2.15), 41.5% of supply (~26.5B XRP) sits in loss — a clear sign of a top-heavy and structurally fragile market dominated by late buyers.” Those on-chain figures provide the background to the 30 November derivatives snapshot: a market whose ownership is skewed toward late entrants now sits on substantial unrealized losses, while the leverage that previously amplified upside has been largely flushed. Taken together, Glassnode’s data on futures open interest and funding rates crystallise the current state of XRP: a violent 59% leverage reset, a near-neutral funding regime, and a speculative cohort that has stepped back from paying for upside, all layered on top of a top-heavy holder base. At press time, XRP traded at $2.04. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Best Crypto to Buy Now as Bitcoin Hyper’s Presale Races Toward the $30M Milestone",
    "body": "What to Know: Bitcoin’s base layer still struggles with slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability, creating a gap between its narrative and everyday usability. As demand for high-throughput DeFi and dApps grows, users increasingly expect instant confirmations and low fees, even when interacting with Bitcoin-linked assets. Bitcoin Hyper plans to introduce a Bitcoin Layer-2 with SVM integration, aiming to deliver faster-than-Solana performance while preserving Bitcoin’s settlement security. By combining low-latency execution, SVM-based smart contracts, and Rust tooling, Bitcoin Hyper targets wrapped $BTC payments, DeFi, NFTs, and gaming on a Bitcoin-secured backbone. Bitcoin’s narrative is shifting again. After a decade of proving itself as pristine collateral and macro hedge, attention is swinging back to utility: payments that actually feel instant, and apps that don’t grind to a halt when demand spikes. Yet on the base layer, Bitcoin still moves slowly, with limited capacity of just seven transactions per second, and no native smart contracts. That mismatch is becoming harder to ignore as users experience sub-second confirmations and near-zero fees on newer chains. When you can move assets cheaply and interact with DeFi in real time elsewhere, waiting minutes for a Bitcoin transaction feels like a relic from another era. The demand is clear: keep Bitcoin’s battle-tested security, but upgrade the experience. ⚙️ This is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) enters the scene. The project positions itself as a Bitcoin Layer-2 that integrates the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), promising Solana-style performance anchored to Bitcoin’s trust layer. If it works, Bitcoin-native dApps stop being theory and start being everyday tools. And the $HYPER presale structure doubles down on that thesis. With a staged price schedule and a $28.8M+ raise, early conviction is rewarded: those stepping in now are effectively betting that Bitcoin Hyper can become a go-to hub for high-speed, Bitcoin-backed DeFi and dApps, not just another speculative token. ➡️ Discover more about this Layer-2 project in our comprehensive Bitcoin Hyper review. Bitcoin Hyper Aims to Turn $BTC Into a High-Speed dApp Platform Bitcoin Hyper pitches a straightforward value proposition: turn Bitcoin from a slow settlement rail into a high-throughput environment where you can pay, trade, lend, and game at speeds that compete with top Layer-1s. Instead of fighting Bitcoin’s limitations, it will route activity to a Layer-2 execution environment while anchoring security back to the main chain. By integrating the SVM, Bitcoin Hyper aims to deliver faster performance than Solana itself for many use cases, while still treating $BTC as the core asset in the ecosystem. That means high-speed payments in wrapped $BTC with low fees, plus DeFi primitives – like swaps, lending, and staking – that feel responsive rather than congested. The project also targets builders with a Rust-based SDK and API support for NFT platforms and gaming dApps, giving developers a familiar toolkit while tapping into Bitcoin’s liquidity. The early traction is notable: the presale has already raised $28.8M, signaling that the market sees potential in a Bitcoin Layer-2 that targets Solana-level speed. ➡️ Check out our guide to buying Bitcoin Hyper if you plan to join the presale. $HYPER’s Presale Momentum Signals Rising Confidence For Bitcoin holders tired of choosing between security and usability, Bitcoin Hyper offers a different trade-off: keep $BTC at the center, but get Solana-style speed and dApp depth. And as the presale races toward the $30M milestone, it’s securing investors and liquidity to entrench that position. The presale’s pricing, early staking incentives, and clear focus on SVM-powered performance give $HYPER a differentiated pitch in a crowded market. Bitcoin Hyper currently costs $0.013355 per token and dynamic staking at 40% APY right now. According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction, $HYPER has the potential to end 2026 at $0.08625 – that’s a ~546% ROI on today’s price. Looking further ahead, $HYPER could reach $0.253 by 2030, a significant ~1,794% ROI. That upside scenario assumes the project becomes a leading venue for Bitcoin-native DeFi and high-throughput applications, not just another experimental scaling play. 🐳 Momentum indicators are starting to line up with that thesis. Smart money is moving, with high-net-worth wallets joining the presale. Whale buys of $502.6K and $379.9K have contributed to $HYPER’s $28.8M-strong presale. Combined with 40% staking APY and rewards geared toward active governance, the tokenomics are clearly designed to favor early, engaged participants. Bitcoin Hyper’s rise as a candidate for best crypto to buy now reflects a deeper shift in the market: users want Bitcoin’s credibility paired with modern UX. If Bitcoin Hyper can bridge that gap between store-of-value and everyday utility and deliver on its promise of extremely low-latency execution, fast smart contracts, and a growing catalog of dApps, it could become a natural hub for Bitcoin-native activity. 🚀 Join the $HYPER presale before the next price increase.

    "title": "$300 Million Crypto Bet: Kazakhstan’s Central Bank Gears Up",
    "body": "Kazakhstan’s central bank has signaled plans to place up to $300 million into crypto and crypto-linked assets, a move that would mark one of the clearest examples yet of a sovereign institution putting reserve money into this market. Based on reports, the funds would come from the country’s gold and foreign-exchange reserves rather than its social or oil wealth funds. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Face A Harsh December: Rising BTC Difficulty, Falling Hashprice Central Bank Moves Cautiously According to central bank briefings and market reporting, the investment will not be made all at once. Initial tranches could be modest — figures discussed publicly include amounts like $50 million and $100 million as possible early steps, with larger allocations of $250 million also on the table if conditions allow. The plan appears to be phased, with the bank watching price swings and market signals before committing major sums. The assets under consideration may include direct holdings of crypto tokens or instruments linked to the crypto sector, such as exchange-traded products and equity stakes in companies that serve the industry. Based on reports, the central bank’s alternative investments arm, which already holds high-tech and financial assets, would manage the placement. Investment Targets And Broader Plans Reports have disclosed that this move sits alongside a wider push to create a national digital-asset reserve fund. Officials and informed sources have mentioned target sizes in the range of $500 million to $1 billion for that reserve. That proposed fund would focus more on ETFs and corporate equity than on simply holding tokens in wallets. An existing state initiative, the Alem Crypto Fund, has already taken public steps into the market. In September 2025 the fund made an investment in the cryptocurrency BNB, signaling that parts of the state apparatus are experimenting with exposure to digital assets. That action is being watched closely by both domestic policymakers and foreign observers. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Sparks CZ Comment: Sell Greed, Buy Fear Risks And Safeguards The central bank has stressed caution. Large price swings in major tokens have been noted as a reason to phase investments slowly. The proposed $300 million allocation, according to briefings, would be drawn from non-essential reserves — explicitly kept separate from Kazakhstan’s National Fund that pays for public programs — which is meant to protect social spending from market losses. Some of the purchases, reports suggest, could be executed through regulated financial products rather than raw token buys, lowering custody and liquidity risks. The decision to structure the program in stages is intended to reduce the chance of a sudden, large loss if markets move against the holdings.

    "title": "$XRP Eyes $10–$20 As Traders Shift Toward Maxi Doge",
    "body": "What to Know: An $XRP breakout toward $10–$20 could trigger a classic top-down rotation, pushing traders from majors into smaller, higher-beta meme coins and community tokens. In risk-on phases, performance-based trading communities and leaderboard-driven contests often attract capital faster than passive ‘hold and hope’ meme coin projects. Maxi Doge targets retail traders without whale capital, combining 1,000x leverage culture, trading competitions, and staking rewards into a meme coin-driven trading hub. Preparing a rotation strategy before any confirmed $XRP breakout can help traders capture outsized upside instead of chasing extended large-cap moves late in the cycle. $XRP has crept back into the conversation as one of the few majors with truly asymmetric upside narratives still on the table. With some analysts floating $10 and even $20 targets if the macro and legal backdrop line up, traders are again gaming out what a confirmed breakout could do to wider risk appetite. If $XRP even starts closing weekly candles above prior cycle resistance, you’re likely looking at a market that flips aggressively risk-on. Historically, that’s when flows tend to cascade down the curve: from Bitcoin into large-cap alts, then into higher-beta sectors like meme coins and micro-cap narratives. For traders, the question isn’t just ‘will $XRP hit $10?’ but ‘how do you position if it tries?’. In a regime shift like that, majors can double or triple, but small caps and meme coins often move 10x–50x faster – both ways. Rotation strategy, not passive bag-holding, usually decides who captures the real upside. 💡 That’s the backdrop where Maxi Doge ($MAXI) starts to make sense as a narrative vehicle. It’s built explicitly around 1,000x leverage culture, trading competitions and meme coin-first branding. It’s a combination aimed at retail traders who want to surf the wave of a risk-on market, not just watch whales dictate the trend. $XRP Breakout Hype and the Shift to High-Beta Risk When majors like $XRP or $SOL enter sustained uptrends, you typically see volatility-per-dollar drop on the large caps and spike further out on the risk curve. That dynamic pushes more aggressive traders into the meme coin and altcoin sectors, where liquidity is thinner but each marginal dollar has more impact on price. The meme coin and trading-community space is already crowded with brands like $DOGE, $SHIB, and $PEPE defining the baseline for what ‘beta’ looks like in crypto. New entrants now need more than a dog logo – they need a clear culture, a trading hook, and a product loop that rewards consistent engagement during both chops and breakouts. In a potential $XRP-driven melt-up, high-beta meme coin plays with clear identities and mechanisms for competition will likely be the ones that capture rotational flows. 💡 Maxi Doge ($MAXI) positions itself as one of several options here, leaning heavily into gym-bro leverage memes and performance-based contests, rather than just passive holding culture. Why Maxi Doge Fits A Risk-On Rotation Playbook Where most meme coins stop at vibes, Maxi Doge leans into a full ‘Leverage King Culture, branding itself as a 240-lb canine juggernaut embodying 1,000x trading mentality. 💡 The core idea is simple: retail traders lack whale-level capital, so you compensate with conviction, discipline, and structured competitions that reward outsized ROI, not just raw size. That ethos is wired into the product loop. Holder-only trading contests and public leaderboards turn $MAXI into more than a static meme coin. Partner tournaments with futures platforms are also included in the $MAXI roadmap. $MAXI is set to become a scoreboard for who trades the best in a bull market. For a risk-on crowd, bragging rights plus rewards is a strong engagement flywheel. That in itself sets Maxi Doge up to be one of the best meme coins to watch. Under the hood, the presale has already raised $4.2M+ signaling early demand for the narrative rather than just thin hype. At the moment, $MAXI tokens are priced at $0.000271. Dynamic staking – currently at 73% – adds another layer for traders who want exposure without full-time screen-watching. ➡️ Check out our guide to buying Maxi Doge if you plan to join the presale. At the end of the day, if $XRP does ignite a full-blown risk-on phase, traders who already mapped out their high-beta rotation – including a meme coin-trading hub like $MAXI – will be better placed than those scrambling after the move. Consider $MAXI while the rotation thesis is still forming. 🚀 Join the Maxi Doge presale before the next price hike.

    "title": "Best Altcoins to Buy as Crypto Derivatives Shift to Full-On FOMO",
    "body": "What to Know: With derivatives markets finally chilling out and funding rates normalizing, traders are quietly swapping fear for early accumulation. This low-volatility window offers a perfect chance to rotate into solid tech plays before leverage-fueled FOMO kicks back in. Bitcoin Hyper is turning heads by raising over $28M to bring Solana-speed smart contracts directly to Bitcoin’s network. Traders are also eyeing SUBBD Token’s AI tools for creators and Monero’s new security upgrades as top picks for this cycle. Derivatives desks are finally taking a breath. Funding rates that were deep underwater are grinding back toward neutral, and implied volatility is dropping across the board, according to a recent report from Black Scholes and ByBit Analytics . This shift matters because it usually signals the move from pure fear to early FOMO. When funding normalizes and volatility drops, leverage hasn’t fully returned yet, but spot and high-conviction altcoins start catching a bid. You’re seeing this right now in specific Bitcoin plays, AI narratives, and legacy privacy tech. In this phase, the market usually rewards projects solving real bottlenecks: Bitcoin’s speed, creator money, and on-chain privacy. Before funding rates get overly excited, there’s a window where rotating into these themes can really boost your risk-reward profile. Here are three best altcoins sitting in that sweet spot: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) , and Monero ($XMR) . They’re at the intersection of demand and new narratives that traders are jumping on as markets stabilize. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – The Bitcoin Layer-2 Making $BTC a Powerhouse Everyone knows Bitcoin is the pristine collateral of crypto, but actually using it is still slow and expensive. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) changes the math by plugging the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) directly into Bitcoin’s network. Think of it as giving Bitcoin a nitrous boost: this Layer-2 gives you the rock-solid settlement of $BTC, but the transaction is instant and cheap, just like Solana. This isn’t just a technical upgrade; it’s about unlocking DeFi on Bitcoin. At the heart of this is the Canonical Bridge, a mechanism that lets you lock native $BTC to mint wrapped assets on the high-speed layer. This allows developers to finally build fast apps – trading, lending, gaming – using tools they already know, without clogging up the main chain. Want to know more? Check out our ‘ What is Bitcoin Hyper ’ guide for more information. The smart money is clearly paying attention. The presale has already swept up over $28.8M with tokens priced at $0.013355. Our experts are already projecting a massive run, seeing $HYPER reach $0.08625 by the end of 2026 , a staggering 546% ROI if you invested at today’s price. On top of that capital appreciation, $HYPER is offering 40% staking rewards, giving you a way to compound your position while the network scales. Get your $HYPER today. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – The Creator Economy’s AI Upgrade While Hyper fixes plumbing, SUBBD Token is tackling the creator economy. The problem is simple: creators do the work, but platforms keep the control (and the fees). SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) flips this by mixing AI with crypto payments. It gives creators tools to automate the grind – imagine an AI assistant that handles fan chats or voice cloning tech that lets you create content without being glued to a microphone 24/7. It’s essentially ‘Scale as a Service’ for influencers, backed by a token that handles access and payments. Holding $SUBBD isn’t just a speculative bet; it’s an access pass. You get voting rights on platform governance, exclusive access to premium token-gated content, and significant discounts on platform subscriptions. Plus, buying in now secures priority access to beta AI tools before the public rollout. The presale is gaining traction with over $1.3M raised, and the 20% staking APY is a solid incentive for getting in early. The upside potential here is catching eyes too; our experts predict the token could hit $0.668 by the end of 2026 . If you invest at today’s price of $0.057075, that represents a massive 1,070% ROI. If you’re looking for a narrative that blends AI utility with real-world adoption, this is the one to watch. Check out our ‘ How to Buy SUBBD Token ’ guide for more details. Buy your SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) today. 3. Monero ($XMR) – The Silent Insurance Policy Monero doesn’t need much introduction – it’s the gold standard for privacy. But right now, it’s becoming more relevant than ever. As surveillance increases and ‘clean’ crypto becomes a regulatory obsession, the demand for truly private, censorship-resistant money quietly grows. $XMR isn’t trying to be the fastest or the wildest; it’s trying to be the most resilient. The upcoming FCMP++ upgrade is doubling down on this, making transactions even harder to trace and strengthening the network’s anonymity set. Traders hold Monero not for the hype, but as a hedge. It’s the portfolio insurance you buy when you realize a fully transparent blockchain future might be a little too transparent. Crucially, the ‘delisting’ fears that used to plague the coin have mostly been solved by the rise of atomic swaps and decentralized exchanges like Haveno. You can now swap $BTC for $XMR peer-to-peer without a centralized middleman or ID check, meaning liquidity is becoming unbannable code rather than a corporate compliance decision. Real usage is also ramping up, with a growing ‘circular economy’ where vendors accept XMR directly for goods and services like VPNs and hosting. Unlike speculative assets that just sit in wallets waiting for a pump, Monero is being used as actual digital cash, giving it a fundamental demand floor that’s hard to shake. Buy Monero ($XMR) on top exchanges like Margex. Recap: As derivatives markets move from fear to early FOMO, structural themes tend to outrun the beta. Bitcoin Hyper , SUBBD Token , and Monero each target real frictions, Bitcoin execution, creator monetization, and on‑chain privacy, making them the best altcoins to buy now. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

    "title": "Strategy’s Green Dots Suggest Flexibility, Fueling Interest in $HYPER Presale",
    "body": "What to Know: Strategy’s willingness to keep Bitcoin sales ‘on the table’ reflects a broader shift toward tactical, actively managed $BTC exposure without abandoning long-term conviction. As Bitcoin’s base layer remains constrained by low throughput and high, cyclical fees, traders increasingly look to Layer 2 infrastructure as leveraged expressions of $BTC upside. Bitcoin Hyper targets Bitcoin’s speed and programmability gap with an SVM-powered Layer 2 that aims for Solana-level performance while settling to Bitcoin. When you see a long-term Bitcoin accumulator suddenly flashing ‘green dots’ instead of just quietly stacking sats, you aren’t just watching a trade, you’re watching a shift in conviction. Many saw the green dots as a sign for more Bitcoin purchases, while others saw it as buybacks or a restructuring of assets. The willingness of major players like Strategy to keep potential $BTC sales on the table signals a massive evolution in the market. Even the loudest ‘HODL forever’ thesis is now being wrapped in active risk management. For you as a trader or allocator, that nuance changes everything. If the most visible corporate-style HODLers are comfortable dialing risk up and down around a core $BTC position, it legitimizes a more tactical approach for the rest of us. It’s no longer a binary choice between ‘all spot, all the time’ or exiting to fiat. Instead, we are seeing sophisticated traders keeping their ‘hard money’ core while rotating a slice of their stack into high-beta ecosystem plays. Why? Because everyone agrees on one thing: Bitcoin’s base layer is incredible for settlement, but it is too slow (~7 TPS) and too rigid for modern apps. The market is realizing that infrastructure, scaling, and programmability layers could outgrow $BTC itself on a percentage basis in a bull cycle. Just as we saw with Ethereum’s modular stack, the real leverage often lies in the layers built on top of the base asset. This is why tactical Bitcoin exposure is drifting toward Layer-2s. Traders are looking for leveraged expressions of Bitcoin’s strength without leaving the ecosystem, hunting for the infrastructure that finally unlocks $BTC for DeFi and gaming. And this is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) enters the fold. Bitcoin Hyper: The ‘Best of Both Worlds’ Engine If you believe Bitcoin will remain the king of settlement but acknowledge it can’t host high-speed gaming or complex DeFi, then you need a high-performance execution layer. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is designed to be exactly that. It creates a fusion that combines Bitcoin’s massive liquidity and security with a real-time Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) Layer-2 for execution. By integrating the SVM, Bitcoin Hyper isn’t just trying to be faster; it’s aiming for sub-second confirmations and throughput in the thousands of transactions per second. It leans into Solana-style performance while settling back to Bitcoin. This directly solves the biggest headaches we all face with $BTC: agonizingly slow block times and fees that spike when the mempool gets clogged. Crucially, this system relies on a Canonical Bridge . This decentralized bridge is the vital link that handles $BTC transfers into the ecosystem, ensuring that assets move securely between the mainnet and the Layer 2. It positions the network not as a competitor trying to kill Bitcoin, but as a modular extension that finally makes your $BTC usable for high-speed swaps, lending, and staking. For full details, check out our ‘ What is Bitcoin Hyper ’ guide. The Financial Upside: Whales and ROI Potential For traders who are reading the market’s ‘green dots’ as a sign to be nimble, the financial setup for $HYPER is looking increasingly attractive. Smart money is already making significant moves to secure its position before the public catches on. We aren’t talking about small change here; we are seeing massive whale conviction. In the last months, we tracked buy-ins of $500K and $379.9K . When wallets of this size start accumulating a presale token, it’s usually a signal that they see something the retail market hasn’t fully priced in yet. Currently, the token is priced at $0.013355. However, our experts see $HYPER hitting $0.08625 by the end of 2026. If you choose to invest at today’s price, hitting that target would give you an ROI of around 545%. The presale has already raised over $28.8M, and with staking rewards at 40% the incentives are aligned for early adopters. If you want $HYPER, get it soon, as a price increase is coming.
