    "title": "CEO Reveals Ripple’s XRP Is Driving A JPMorgan Competitor, Is SWIFT Next?",
    "body": "The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Teucrium Trading, Sal Gilbertie, has given a bold endorsement of Ripple and XRP, positioning the crypto payments company as a potential competitor to JPMorgan Chase. He described Ripple as a highly interconnected ecosystem that could scale globally once it acquires a banking license. As Ripple grows to challenge the largest bank in the US, it raises the question about how its rapidly expanding network could also rival legacy banking systems like SWIFT. Ripple Positioned As New JPMorgan And SWIFT Rival Crypto enthusiast and XRP advocate Diana recently shared a striking interview between Paul Barron, founder of the Paul Barron Network, and Gilbertie. In the interview, the Teucrium Trading CEO shared his perspective on Ripple, showing full support for the crypto payment company’s growth and future potential. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Predicts XRP Rush, What Does He Mean? He explained that Ripple is actively building a fully operational financial institution capable of rivaling traditional banking giants like JPMorgan. The crypto payments company has also frequently been described as a competitor to SWIFT, positioning itself as a faster and more efficient alternative for cross-border payments. Gilbertie stressed that once Ripple obtains a banking license, it would operate with the capitalization and operational discipline typically associated with top-tier banks. Notably, the crypto payments company has been seeking a US national banking charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to establish a new national trust bank. If authorized, Ripple could become one of the first crypto-native companies to obtain a US national bank license. Moving forward, Gilbertie said during the interview that XRP lies at the heart of this growing banking ecosystem. He noted that Ripple has no intention of selling XRP, describing the cryptocurrency as a strategic asset whose value is intended to appreciate over time through its use across the XRPL ecosystem. The Teucrium Trading CEO also called Ripple a “machine,” highlighting how the company operates in a disciplined, coordinated way, with its team growing and innovating while keeping the network strong and connected. Furthermore, he boldly claimed that Ripple is at the center of the universe, underscoring its pivotal role in potentially shaping the global banking landscape. Gilbertie’s Validation Confirms XRP’s Role The interview between Gilbertie and Barron drew strong, supportive reactions from many members of the crypto community, who interpreted the Teucrium Trading CEO’s statement as validation of XRP’s evolving role in institutional finance. Observers noted that hearing a regulated TradFi CEO describe Ripple as a JPMorgan rival offered rare institutional recognition that went beyond the usual industry speculation.

They also pointed out that the timing of this endorsement coincides with the upcoming full enforcement of ISO 20022 standards and rising XRP ETF inflows. Diana, the XRP advocate who shared the interview, echoed this view, emphasizing that Gilbertie’s statements signal that infrastructure, compliance, and institutional interest are all aligning. She noted that price movements typically follow institutional and infrastructure rails, suggesting that XRP may be positioned for substantial growth once these rails are fully in place.

    "body": "XRP’s market momentum accelerated this week as the cryptocurrency hit a key bullish target identified by a prominent trader, reinforcing growing confidence across the community. Related Reading: Will The Low XRP Price Force Ripple To Dump Its Holdings? Exec Answers Community The surge comes amid a wave of institutional inflows, multiple ETF launches, expanding utility, and renewed optimism from analysts who believe XRP is entering a powerful new phase of market participation. XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Technical Breakout: Bull Flag Target Achieved A precise technical call from trader @kriptocumm caught the attention of XRP traders after the asset reached the exact bull flag target he outlined earlier in the week. KripTocuM’s analysis, shared on November 22, identified a textbook flag pattern with support at $1.8810 and a breakout requirement above $1.92. Using the pole height of roughly $1.37 added to the breakout point, he calculated a target of $2.1076. On November 24, XRP rallied past $2, coming within striking distance of the projected level, before stabilizing near $2.055. Trading volume jumped to $3.85 billion, reflecting heightened market participation and validating the breakout structure. Indicators remained tilted bullish, with RSI at 62 and a positive MACD crossover suggesting further upside potential. XRP ETF Momentum Pushes Institutional Demand Higher XRP’s move arrives during one of its strongest weeks of institutional interest to date. Franklin Templeton’s newly approved spot XRP ETF (XRPZ) debuted on the NYSE with projected first-day volumes of up to $30 million. The fund’s aggressive fee-waiver strategy, 0% on the first $5 billion until May 2026, has already drawn investor attention. Grayscale also launched its XRP Trust ETF (GXRP) with a temporary 0% fee, expanding access for traditional market participants seeking regulated exposure. Both products entered the market as XRP recorded $179.6 million in weekly inflows, sharply contrasting heavy outflows from Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Analysts say this rotation signals a shift toward altcoins with clearer catalysts and strengthening fundamentals. Analysts See Expanding Utility and Long-Term Upside Growing utility narratives continue to enhance XRP’s appeal. CryptoSensei recently reiterated explosive price projections, conditional on supply constraints, while pointing to rising institutional adoption, expanding treasury use, and new stablecoin-related integrations as key pillars for long-term growth. Meanwhile, Ripple’s new Asian banking partnership and ongoing XRPL scalability upgrades are adding further confidence to XRP’s fundamental outlook.

    "title": "63K Bitcoin Exits Long-Term Wallets: A Surge of Speculative Short-Term Buying",
    "body": "Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim momentum as it trades below the critical $90,000 level, with selling pressure dominating the market and fear spreading rapidly. Many analysts are leaning toward calling the start of a new bear market, arguing that Bitcoin likely topped in early October near $126,000. Momentum has weakened sharply since then, and investor behavior now reflects a shift toward risk-off positioning. Related Reading: Anti-CZ Whale Loses Big: $61M in Profit Wiped Out As Ethereum and XRP Longs Collapse A new report from CryptoOnchain, published via CryptoQuant, highlights one of the most significant developments of this cycle: a historic 63,000 BTC has moved from long-term holders (LTHs) to short-term holders (STHs). This unprecedented transfer is clearly visible in the Long-Term Holder Net Position Change chart, which shows a massive red bar — a negative daily difference signaling heavy outflows from long-term holder wallets. This type of behavior typically appears during late-stage bull markets or near local and cycle tops, when long-time investors with substantial profit margins begin realizing gains. At the same time, the corresponding Short-Term Holder Net Position Change chart shows a huge green bar, confirming that newer, more reactive market participants are buying these coins, often at elevated prices. Long-Term Holders Distribute as Short-Term Buyers Absorb Supply CryptoOnchain explains that the current market structure is being shaped by a clear divergence in behavior between Long-Term Holders (LTHs) and Short-Term Holders (STHs). LTHs — historically considered the “strong hands” of the market — are now heavily distributing, sending large amounts of Bitcoin into the market after months or even years of holding. At the same time, STHs are aggressively buying and accumulating this supply, often entering positions at elevated prices despite growing volatility. This dynamic is not inherently a bearish signal on its own. In fact, such transitions are common during late-stage bull markets, where early investors secure profits while new participants enter the market with fresh capital. It reflects a natural rotation of supply from experienced holders to newer ones, a pattern seen repeatedly in previous cycles. However, the volume of distribution is significant, and it raises an important risk: if incoming demand fails to fully absorb the coins being offloaded by LTHs, the market could face a deeper correction or extended consolidation phase. This supply pressure can weigh on price, especially in a context where sentiment is fragile and macro conditions remain uncertain. Related Reading: STH Panic Emerges as Bitcoin Crashes To $81K: Realized P/L Turns Negative For The First Time This Cycle Weekly Chart Signals a Critical Retest of Macro Support Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize around the $87,000 level after an intense multi-week sell-off that dragged price as low as $85,946. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin has now tapped the 100-week moving average (green line), a historically important support level during bull-market retracements. This line acted as a springboard in previous cycles, but the current bounce remains weak and indecisive, reflecting the fear dominating the market. Momentum has clearly shifted bearish. The breakdown from the $110K–$100K consolidation zone triggered accelerated selling, confirming a loss of market structure on the weekly timeframe. Candles over the past three weeks show high-volume distribution, with sellers overwhelming demand each time Bitcoin attempted to reclaim higher levels. The steep slope of the 50-week MA turning slightly down is another sign that trend strength has softened.

Bulls aggressively defended this area in prior macro corrections, and holding above $83K–$86K keeps the long-term bull structure intact. A weekly close below this zone, however, opens the door to deeper downside toward the 200-week MA near $56K–$60K. Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

Related Reading: Will The Low XRP Price Force Ripple To Dump Its Holdings? Exec Answers Community The wider crypto market is finally flashing green, but the HBAR price is clearly outpacing the pack thanks to a wave of institutional interest, rising ETF inflows, and growing excitement ahead of Coinbase’s futures launch. Still, despite the bullish sentiment, chart signals warn that the token isn’t out of danger just yet. HBAR's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: HBARUSD on Tradingview ETF Inflows, Futures Launch Fuel the Rally The sudden HBAR price acceleration comes at a moment when multiple catalysts are stacking in its favor. Trading volume has surged by more than 190%, pushing Hedera into the top gainer bracket of the day. A major driver is Coinbase’s upcoming rollout of 24/7 HBAR futures trading on December 5, which opens the door for more institutional hedging, speculation, and liquidity. The ETF space is also turning increasingly supportive. Canary Capital’s HBAR ETF has boosted its holdings to over 421 million HBAR, now valued at nearly $55 million, after three straight sessions of positive net inflows. Since its launch, the ETF has attracted over $72 million, a rare trend during a period when other major crypto funds, particularly those focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum, have experienced significant outflows. Additionally, the IRS’s new stance allowing staking inside ETFs and the SEC’s updated listing standards have brightened the long-term outlook for HBAR-based investment products. Meanwhile, real-world adoption narratives are strengthening thanks to Wyoming’s stablecoin pilot on Hedera and tokenized ETF assets deployed. HBAR Price Bullish Setup, But Still Below Key Trendlines Technically, the HBAR price is showing early signs of a possible reversal. Analysts highlight a triple bottom pattern forming around the $0.123 zone, an area buyers have defended multiple times this year. Rising futures open interest and an improving long/short ratio add to the bullish backdrop. However, Hedera remains trapped beneath a dominant descending trendline that has rejected every rally since September. The 20-day EMA at $0.155 continues to cap upside attempts, while the 50- and 100-day EMAs reinforce heavy resistance above. Momentum indicators have improved, but the broader trend remains bearish unless the HBAR price decisively breaks above $0.155. Short-Term Outlook: Cautious Optimism If buyers maintain pressure, the HBAR price could retest the $0.16–$0.18 region. A clean breakout above the falling channel would set the stage for a larger move toward $0.228, the neckline of the triple bottom. But failure to overcome resistance keeps the token vulnerable to retracements toward $0.14, then $0.125, and potentially $0.10 if bearish momentum resurfaces.

    "title": "JPMorgan’s Alleged Short On Strategy (MSTR): How A 50% Price Jump Could Spell Major Troubles",
    "body": "Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, the largest public holder of Bitcoin (BTC), finds itself at the center of a stormy controversy involving JPMorgan as Bitcoin prices continue to struggle. With signs of a potential bear market emerging, fresh rumors suggest that one of the world’s largest banks allegedly holds a significant short position on Strategy’s stock (MSTR), which has plunged 69% from its record high of $543 per share last year. Strategy Faces Potential MSCI Exclusion The turmoil escalated last week when JPMorgan issued a warning that Strategy might soon be removed from major equity indices, specifically the MSCI USA Index. JPMorgan’s analysts noted that the issues facing Strategy extend beyond the recent downturn in cryptocurrency prices, which have seen Bitcoin fall more than 30% from its all-time highs. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading around $86,000, while the broader crypto market has experienced a staggering $1 trillion decline in total market capitalization over the past month. Related Reading: Why XRP Price Crash Below $2 Is Not A Problem – $20 Is Still The Target JPMorgan’s analysts indicated that MSCI is considering whether companies with over 50% of their total assets in digital currencies should qualify for inclusion in traditional equity indices. Given that Strategy’s balance sheet is heavily weighted with Bitcoin, it is at significant risk of exclusion. The analysts stated that “MicroStrategy [is] at risk of exclusion from major equity indices as the January 15th MSCI decision approaches.” They speculated that removal from the MSCI could trigger approximately $2.8 billion in outflows, and if other index providers follow MSCI’s lead, the total could reach as high as $8.8 billion. The situation is complicated by market dynamics, particularly the timing of JPMorgan’s bearish note, which coincided with Bitcoin’s weakness and MSTR’s decline, all while liquidity was thin and overall sentiment fragile. JPMorgan Faces Account Closures Surge According to analysts at the Bull Theory, JPMorgan has been noted for timing its market reports—bearing down when prices are already weak and striking a more bullish tone near market peaks. The analysts have highlighted that share lending for MSTR has reportedly increased, allowing brokers to lend shares to short sellers, which can exacerbate downward pressure on the stock price. Additionally, there are escalating reports of widespread account closures at JPMorgan, with thousands claiming to have exited due to perceived manipulation of both MSTR and Bitcoin. Related Reading: A Quiet Move In Bitcoin Options Is Starting To Raise Big Questions Amid these developments, the fear of a potential short squeeze is growing. The analysts believe that if Strategy’s stock were to rally around 40% to 50%, it could trigger a short squeeze in the bank’s position and spell major financial troubles. In response, Michael Saylor, the CEO of Strategy, has sought to clarify the company’s identity, emphasizing that it is not just a passive Bitcoin holder. He pointed out that Strategy operates as a software business with an active financial strategy, countering the narrative circulating around MSCI’s concerns. As the situation unfolds, several key points emerge. The October 10th crash appeared to align with the MSCI announcement, coinciding with an already fragile market state. JP Morgan’s strategic timing of its bearish insights has amplified existing fears, creating further uncertainty as MSCI’s final decision looms.

    "body": "The recent downturn in the crypto market, which saw total valuations plummet from an all-time high of nearly $4.3 trillion to below the $3 trillion mark, has severely impacted many investors. Among those affected is the Trump family, whose wealth reportedly decreased by $1 billion over the past month, according to Bloomberg. Their current net worth now stands at approximately $6.7 billion, down from $7.7 billion in September. Trump Family’s Crypto Portfolio Takes Major Hits The family’s crypto portfolio has suffered significant losses as a result of recent market conditions, including President Trump’s official memecoin, TRUMP, Eric Trump’s Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm, American Bitcoin (ABTC), and Truth Social—all of which are Bitcoin-related. Related Reading: XRP Real Purpose: Documentation Shows Payment Utility Contrary To Viral Claims — Details One of the hardest-hit entities is Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of Truth Social. Last week, shares of the firm dropped to a record low, resulting in an estimated $800 million decline in Trump’s stake since September. The company has invested heavily in Bitcoin, spending roughly $2 billion on digital assets. Its stockpile of approximately 11,500 BTC, purchased when Bitcoin prices hovered around $115,000, now represents a significant downturn of about 25%. In addition, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), regarded as the Trump family’s principal crypto operation, has seen its value diminish rapidly. WLFI, which was once trading at $0.26, has now fallen to around $0.15 when writing. At its peak, the token’s total valuation reached about $6 billion, but it is now worth just over $4 billion. Despite the difficulties, a spokesperson for World Liberty Financial expressed optimism, stating that “Crypto is here to stay.” The spokesperson emphasized a long-term conviction in the technologies that support digital assets, suggesting that these innovations could transform financial services. Eric Trump Remains Optimistic Following his return to office in January, President Trump’s sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., also began collaborating with Hut 8 Corp, a crypto company that supplies Bitcoin mining equipment. In exchange, they secured a controlling interest in a newly formed organization called American Bitcoin Corp. Eric Trump reportedly holds about 7.5% of this new venture.

However, shares of Hut 8, which are traded on Nasdaq, have been cut by nearly half, wiping out over $300 million from Eric Trump’s wealth since September, with shares previously valued at $9.31. Amidst these financial challenges, Eric Trump conveyed a sense of optimism, suggesting that the recent market declines may present “a great buying opportunity.” He emphasized that those who purchase during downturns and embrace market volatility are likely to be the long-term winners in the cryptocurrency landscape. Currently, the market’s leading cryptocurrency has seen a 1.5% recovery on Monday toward $88,430, after reaching an 8-month low of $80,000 last Friday. This positions BTC nearly 30% below all-time highs of $126,000 reached back in October. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Bitcoin To $40,000? Signal Behind Past 60% Crashes Is Back",
    "body": "A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how a technical analysis (TA) signal that led into major price declines in the past has returned for Bitcoin. Monthly MACD Has Turned Bearish For Bitcoin In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a signal that has formed in the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) for Bitcoin. MACD is a TA indicator that’s generally used for timing buys and sells in an asset’s price chart. Related Reading: USDC Floods Exchanges: Are Traders Buying The Bitcoin Crash? The indicator consists of two lines: MACD line and signal line. The first of these, the MACD line, is found by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) of the price from its 12-period EMA. The signal line tracks the 9-period EMA of this difference. Crossovers between the two lines can provide buy or sell signals for the asset. The MACD line breaking above the signal line could be considered a bullish signal, while the reverse type of crossover a bearish one. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows how the monthly MACD has changed for Bitcoin over the last several years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin MACD has registered a crossover recently. The MACD line has plunged as the asset has witnessed its bearish momentum and it’s now sitting under the signal line. As mentioned earlier, such a signal can be a bearish one. In the chart, the analyst has highlighted the past instances of this pattern. It would appear that the last three sell signals from the indicator all led into declines of more than 60% for the cryptocurrency. “If that repeats, the chart points to $40,000,” noted Martinez. It now remains to be seen whether the MACD will hold for Bitcoin, or if a different trend from the past will follow this time around. The MACD line falling under its signal line isn’t the only bearish crossover that BTC has faced recently. As the analyst has pointed out in another X post, a classic death cross has also appeared between the asset’s 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and 200-day SMA. From the chart, it’s apparent that the 50-day SMA has declined below the 200-day SMA alongside the latest Bitcoin market downturn. During the past couple of years, each such signal has marked local bottoms for BTC, but in 2022, this crossover kicked off the bear market. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Yet To Top In This Cycle? What aSOPR Suggests So far since the death cross has appeared, the asset has continued to decline, a potential sign that this death cross may be different from the recent ones. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $88,800, down over 4% in the last seven days. Featured image from Dall-E, charts from TradingView.com",

    "title": "BitMine Bags 70K ETH As PEPENODE Mining Meme Coin Nears $2.2M in Viral Presale",
    "body": "What to Know: BitMine Immersion now controls 3% of Ethereum’s circulating supply after buying nearly 70K $ETH in a single week. Crypto treasury stocks have seen their market caps compress relative to holdings, even as major players keep accumulating $BTC and $ETH. PEPENODE’s mine-to-earn model turns virtual mining rigs and meme rewards into a high-engagement alternative to passive presale tokens. For degen-level risk-takers, $PEPENODE combines early-stage staking yield and meme exposure into one speculative ecosystem play. Ethereum treasuries are back in the spotlight. BitMine Immersion Technology just snapped up another 69,822 $ETH in a single week, lifting its stash to 3.63M $ETH (roughly 3% of the entire circulating supply), and boosting combined crypto and cash holdings to $11.2B. The timing is spicy. $ETH has dropped close to 30% over the past month, dragging the value of BitMine’s treasury down from over $12B to near $10–11B before the latest rebound. Yet BitMine keeps buying, effectively doubling down on an ‘own the network’ thesis while its stock trades under pressure like other crypto-treasury plays. It’s the same tension playing out in Bitcoin land. Large $BTC treasuries have seen their market caps slump relative to the value of the coins they hold. And yet, while some $BTC has bled off, the drumbeat of acquisitions continues. This ongoing trend generates a weird split: corporate balance sheets hoarding blue-chip crypto, public equity multiples compressing, and retail investors left wondering whether to buy the coins, the stocks, or something else entirely. That’s where high-yield narratives like PEPENODE start to look interesting, particularly for meme coin hunting retail traders. Instead of owning a listed treasury at a discount, you effectively buy into a mine-to-earn meme ecosystem with direct token exposure, aggressive staking yields, and gamified virtual mining mechanics. PEPENODE Turns Virtual Mining Into Meme-Driven Yield PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is built as a mine-to-earn meme coin on Ethereum, but it doesn’t ask anyone to plug in an ASIC. Instead, the project unveils a fully virtual mining simulator where holders use $PEPENODE tokens to buy miner nodes and upgrade digital facilities. Here, you’re building out customizable server rooms that generate simulated hashpower and rewards inside a web app dashboard. The idea is simple but clever; virtual mining rewards put in a meme coin wrapper and accessible from any basic Ethereum wallet. No rigs, no cooling fans, no angry landlord. PEPENODE also leans into the meme economy. The roadmap includes rewards not only in $PEPENODE itself but also in some of the best meme coins like $PEPE and other community favorites. These rewards will go to the top leaderboard players once the full game is live. That turns the platform into a kind of meta-meme mining arcade: you’re using one frog coin to farm a whole basket of others. On top of the gameplay, the presale already offers staking, not at a whopping 589% rewards for early participants, with emissions distributed over two years. It fits the project’s pitch: reward early backers aggressively while the mine-to-earn ecosystem spins up. For anyone watching BitMine push toward a validator-heavy future with its planned US-based staking network, PEPENODE feels like the retail, gamified interpretation of the same meta, just with memes, frogs, and a leaderboard instead of a Nasdaq ticker. Check PEPENODE’s official website for more. $PEPENODE Presale Maps Out 2025–2026 Upside While treasuries like BitMine and the big Bitcoin holders wrestle with stock prices that occasionally drift below the value of their underlying crypto, $PEPENODE is still in pure token-issuance mode. The presale has already crossed $2.19M raised at a live token price of $0.0011638, with staged pricing designed to ratchet higher as each funding milestone is hit. That puts new buyers roughly in line with recent analyst models. Our $PEPENODE token forecast sees a potential high of $0.0077 for 2026 if the mine-to-earn game launches on schedule, exchange listings land, and crypto sentiment stays constructive. From today’s presale price, that implies a theoretical upside of roughly ~560% into 2026 under optimistic conditions. Learn how to buy $PEPENODE to join now. Instead of paying a premium or small discount for a listed treasury stock, whose upside is tied to multiples and macro flows, you’re taking on a high-risk, high-reward crypto with high-APR staking, decent upside potential, and optional exposure to multiple meme assets via the virtual mining rewards. Instead of just parking tokens and waiting for TGE, early buyers can stake immediately, then later deploy those same tokens into nodes and upgrades once Phase 3 of the roadmap kicks in. The result is a presale that behaves less like a static raise and more like a soft launch of the game economy. In a market where big treasuries are under valuation pressure but still hoarding $BTC and $ETH on conviction, that kind of asymmetric, gameplay-driven upside is exactly what many retail traders are hunting for on the risk curve. Explore the PEPENODE presale while early. This is not financial advice. Crypto and presale investments are highly volatile; never risk capital you cannot afford to lose.

    "title": "Franklin’s XRP ETF Move Puts SUBBD Token’s Payments Play In The Spotlight",
    "body": "What to Know: Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF launch reinforces the idea that on-chain settlement assets are becoming part of mainstream financial infrastructure. As XRP’s payment narrative matures through regulated ETFs, investors increasingly look to smaller-cap projects building specialized on-chain payment rails. SUBBD Token targets the creator economy with Web3 subscriptions, AI-powered tools, and on-chain payments designed to streamline global creator–fan monetization. The SUBBD presale blends high-advertised staking rewards with payment-focused utility, offering a leveraged play on the broader settlement narrative. Franklin Templeton stepping into the XRP ETF race is more than another ticker lighting up on NYSE Arca. Its new product, XRPZ , is being positioned as a regulated gateway into an asset the firm says plays a ‘foundational role’ in global settlement. Coming from one of the world’s oldest asset managers , that language is a loud signal: on-chain payments aren’t a fringe experiment anymore, they’re entering the institutional toolkit. XRP’s pitch has always been straightforward: faster, cheaper cross-border settlement that overlays existing banking infrastructure instead of trying to rip it out. When a legacy manager wraps that thesis in an ETF and labels it core infrastructure, it effectively tells traditional capital that this is now part of the plumbing, not a speculative side quest. The market backdrop strengthens that read. XRP has been outperforming relief rallies as traders shift into payment and settlement narratives, while regulators in major jurisdictions are increasingly treating it as a utility-grade asset rather than a high-beta security proxy. The broader story of real-world payments, speed, and transaction efficiency is finally maturing just as institutional wrappers arrive. That’s where the ripple effects start. Once big funds get comfortable with the payments narrative through products like XRPZ, their next instinct is to look further down the risk curve for emerging infrastructure plays. If XRP is the ‘blue-chip’ settlement asset, the hunt naturally shifts to smaller-cap projects aiming to modernize payments in niche, high-growth verticals. And that’s exactly where SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) lands, a creator-economy payment and subscription layer enhanced by AI automation tools, currently live in presale and positioning itself as the next wave of Web3 settlement infrastructure. SUBBD Token Builds Payment Rails For The Creator Economy SUBBD positions itself as a Web3 subscription stack for the creator economy: recurring payments, gated content, AI-powered automation, and fan interactions, all unified by a single token. Instead of relying on card processors, unpredictable platform policies, and high take-rates, $SUBBD aims to let fans subscribe, tip, and unlock exclusive content fully on-chain, giving creators more control over revenue, distribution, and audience data. The core pitch mirrors the same value proposition that’s suddenly making XRP ETFs appealing to TradFi: efficient, programmable payments. Where XRP focuses on global settlement infrastructure, SUBBD targets the $80B+ creator economy, a sector still running on siloed, fee-heavy rails where creators depend on platforms that can change rules overnight. By moving subscriptions and microtransactions on-chain, SUBBD removes chargebacks, reduces intermediaries, lowers international friction, and makes cross-border creator payments effectively instant. At the center of that system is the token. $SUBBD powers platform payments, unlocks premium features, and rewards active participation across the ecosystem. Fans can request custom content, tip creators directly, or access authenticated AI-generated assets and subscriber-only experiences. Creators earn a native asset they can stake, reinvest into perks, and, as governance evolves, potentially help steer platform direction. Staking is a major part of the early flywheel. The presale advertises headline yields up to 628%, a clear attempt to incentivize early adopters who want long-term exposure rather than short-term speculation. For investors watching XRP ETFs normalize on-chain settlement, a model where value flows back to participants instead of intermediaries fits neatly into the same macro trend. With that backdrop, SUBBD stops looking like a random presale and starts reading as a focused bet on where sector-specific payment rails are heading next, especially for investors tracking the overlap between creator monetization, AI tooling, and on-chain settlement. SUBBD Token Presale Targets High-Upside XRP-Style Thesis On the numbers front, the SUBBD presale has already cleared $1.36M in commitments, with tokens currently offered at around $0.057025. For a project still pre-listing, that level of early demand suggests the payments narrative is resonating with at least part of the market, especially notable given how choppy broader conditions remain. The presale is set to run into Q4 2025, giving the team a long runway to expand the product suite, ship AI creator tools, and secure platform partnerships before major exchange listings. That buffer matters. If XRP-style payment narratives continue gaining institutional traction through ETFs and regulated wrappers, smaller projects positioned as niche payment rails could benefit from both narrative spillover and practical integration into everyday creator workflows. Our price predictions have SUBBD reaching a potential year-end 2025 high of around $0.438 — roughly a 7.7x gain from today’s presale pricing — assuming execution stays on track and market momentum continues. Looking ahead, the same framework floats a 2026 high around $0.66, which would imply roughly 11–12x upside under bullish conditions if user adoption and listings track positively. None of these scenarios is guaranteed. Hitting them would require SUBBD to deliver on its roadmap, onboard real creators and audiences, and avoid the typical post-listing unwind that derails many presales. But set against Franklin Templeton’s renewed push into XRP’s settlement thesis, the broader picture becomes clearer: If blockchains are increasingly being used as real settlement layers, then application-layer tokens specializing in high-frequency, creator-driven payments represent a logical higher-beta extension of that trend. For traders comfortable with that profile, the combination of live presale pricing, aggressive staking incentives, and a payments-first narrative aligned with XRP’s new institutional moment is the kind of setup that tends to catch early-stage attention. Risk-tolerant investors who want exposure to the narrative can follow our full guide on how to buy SUBBD .

    "title": "Bitcoin Flashes A Triple Bearish Divergence: CMT Sounds The Alarm",
    "body": "Bitcoin’s three-year advance may be rolling over, according to Chartered Market Technician Tony Severino, who argues that BTC has now completed a “triple bearish divergence” on higher timeframes – a structure he characterises as the trend “dying under the hood” even as price printed fresh highs. Bitcoin Has Hit A Triple Bearish Divergence In a video published on November 24 and shared on X, Severino says he had to go beyond standard references to formalise the pattern. “I really never heard that statement before,” he admits of the term triple negative divergence. “There wasn’t a lot of information on Google I turned to AI, turned to ChatGPT.” His working definition: “three successive higher highs on price and three successive lower highs on the technical indicator.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Local Bottom To Fall Between These Two Levels – Analyst A standard bearish divergence occurs when price makes a higher high while an oscillator such as RSI, MACD or Stochastic posts a lower high, signalling trend exhaustion. Extending that to three peaks, Severino says, amplifies the warning: “A triple negative or triple bearish divergence is basically the market screaming, price is still drifting higher, but under the hood, this trend is dying.” Later he adds, “A single divergence is already a warning. A triple divergence is like yellow, orange, flashing red.” Severino maps this pattern onto Bitcoin’s bull cycle using the monthly chart, anchored around three key highs. The first, he argues, came around the spot ETF launch and aligned with a wave-three impulse in his Elliott Wave count. “This was our ETF launch and it was during our wave three impulse […] everybody’s excited. We had the ETF launch […] strong volume, strong momentum,” he says, calling it the cycle’s momentum peak. The second high broke that level but on weaker internals. “Second high breaks the old high. The indicator’s high is weaker. This represents fewer aggressive buyers. Early participants start taking profits. This was me. I started taking profit here,” he notes. In his interpretation, that push represented a fifth wave. The third high, marginally above prior peaks near $126,000, is where he sees exhaustion. “On the third high, price index is higher. Marginal new high […] I sold around $105k […] we went to $126k, so I left only a very small amount on the table to not get caught up in what comes after all this,” he says. The oscillator, however, made yet another lower high: “Buyers are exhausted at this point. Shorts are covering, late FOMO buyers push it just a little bit higher. Pros use this zone to offload positions or start shorting.” He argues that sentiment at the top was complacent rather than euphoric. “I don’t think we were euphoric here. I think we were euphoric at this one […] but we were very complacent this whole time […] everybody just was like, it’s going up forever.” Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Yet To Top In This Cycle? What aSOPR Suggests Crucially, Severino insists the divergence is a setup, not a standalone trigger: “You want confirmation before acting.” He points to several. First, a break of the rising trendline connecting the major swing lows: “Here is our trend line and we are below. There is our confirmation.” Second, loss of key moving averages such as the 20 and 50 EMA that had supported the uptrend. Third, a regime shift in weekly RSI: during the bull, it repeatedly bounced in the 40–50 zone, but now, he says, “falling below it is confirmation that the trend is now no longer holding.” On volume, he warns against reading the recent spike on a down candle as capitulation. While the FTX bottom showed extreme, climactic volume, the latest breakout in selling may instead be “the breakout and start of a trend” to the downside, he suggests, especially given the declining volume into Bitcoin’s final highs. How Low Can Bitcoin Go? For potential downside, Severino overlays Fibonacci levels on the full advance and references guidance that triple divergences often resolve toward the 0.5–0.618 retracement between $44,100 and $34,409. In Bitcoin’s case, he marks a wide lower zone where an A-B-C structure could terminate, estimating “about like 60 something percent, maybe even closer to 70” from the top – “very par for the course for a Bitcoin bear market,” in his words. More ominously, he hints at a “bigger version of this” on even higher timeframes, suggesting a larger triple divergence may be forming with the recent structure nested inside it. “This could not be so great for the higher time frames Bitcoin,” he says. Still, he repeatedly stresses uncertainty and risk management. “I can’t say that this signal is the end-all be-all […] it doesn’t guarantee anything,” he says. “I definitely don’t want you to be like, hey, Tony, well, I believe you 100%. Immediately, I’m going to sell my coins. No, it’s not financial advice […] It’s more about how you manage risk.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $87,658.

    "title": "MSCI, JPMorgan, Strategy, and Why Bitcoin Hyper Is Suddenly On Everyone’s Radar",
    "body": "What to Know: MSCI’s consultation to exclude $BTC-heavy ‘digital asset treasury’ companies from major indexes has turned Strategy into a test case for forced selling risk. JPMorgan’s bearish note on Strategy landed in a weak, thin market, amplifying fear, rumors of shorts, and even a grassroots JPMorgan boycott narrative. Bitcoin Hyper’s $HYPER token offers a crypto-native way to play Bitcoin scaling, combining a $BTC Layer-2 design with audited contracts, staking, and presale access. When the market tanked on October 10, there was no obvious macro bomb, no ETF denial, no regulatory headline. Just a brutal, mechanical flush that felt … engineered. The missing piece turned out to be MSCI. On 10 October, the index giant quietly launched a consultation that could exclude companies whose balance sheet holds 50% or more in Bitcoin or other digital assets from its global equity indexes. That hits Strategy ($MSTR) right where it lives, because the stock is essentially a leveraged proxy on corporate Bitcoin accumulation. If MSCI goes ahead, index funds that track those benchmarks are forced sellers. In a market already thinned out by quantitative tightening and drained dollar liquidity, the mere prospect of billions in automatic selling was enough to flip $BTC and $MSTR from ‘buy the dip’ to ‘get me out’. Then JPMorgan walked in with a bearish note. Exactly while $BTC was sliding, liquidity was thin, and $MSTR was already down badly, the bank resurfaced the index-exclusion risk and put numbers on it: roughly $2.8B of potential forced selling from MSCI indexes alone. Analysts flagged that the note leaned on an MSCI document that had been sitting for weeks, and only became ‘urgent’ right as markets were on the ropes, fuelling accusations that sentiment was being steered rather than merely described Around that, a familiar set of narratives exploded: rumors that large institutions might short $MSTR, concerns about brokers lending out client shares to fuel those shorts, and an online boycott campaign where thousands of users claim to be closing JPMorgan accounts in protest. Michael Saylor pushed back, stressing that Strategy is not a passive Bitcoin fund but a software and financial engineering company with revenue, products, and $BTC-backed instruments, arguing that MSCI is misclassifying a live business as a treasury wrapper. 💣 Even so, the consultation runs until year-end, and the decision scheduled for January 15 2026 still hangs over every $BTC-heavy equity. So this isn’t just a one-off crash story anymore. It’s about how index rules, bank research notes, and rumor cycles can yank liquidity away from anything that looks like a Bitcoin proxy. Which is exactly why a bunch of capital is rotating into pure-play Bitcoin infrastructure and presale tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) As A Clean $BTC Narrative Play Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is building a dedicated Bitcoin Layer-2 that lets $BTC itself move faster, cheaper, and in more programmable ways. The $HYPER token will power the Layer-2 for gas, governance, and staking. Mechanically, the design is pretty straightforward for anyone used to Layer-2s. $BTC is locked on the Bitcoin Layer-1 via a canonical bridge. A relay program will verify Bitcoin block headers and proofs, then mint a representation on the Layer-2. Transactions will execute on a Solana Virtual Machine environment with high throughput and low latency, while batches and zero-knowledge proofs will be periodically committed back to Bitcoin. That’ll keep settlement anchored to $BTC’s security while letting you actually do things like payments, DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins. From a positioning angle, that’s important. If MSCI and other index providers are about to penalize companies that warehouse $BTC on their balance sheets, the market’s next question is: where does all the ‘Bitcoin leverage’ go instead? ⚡️ One obvious answer is native $BTC Layer-2s, where returns are tied to actual network usage rather than index inclusion politics. Bitcoin Hyper is very explicitly trying to be that ‘speed layer’ for $BTC. In short, while banks debate whether Strategy qualifies for index membership, Bitcoin Hyper is trying to earn its place as infrastructure. For anyone who wants $BTC exposure without giving MSCI and JPMorgan veto power over flows, that pitch lands pretty well. ➡️ Looking for more information on the project that could change Bitcoin forever? Check out our Bitcoin Hyper review. Inside The Bitcoin Hyper Presale And Staking Mechanics There’s also upside math at play here. Our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction believes that if the project team ships its initial roadmap – mainnet, bridge, early dApps, and listings – $HYPER has the potential trade as high as $0.08625 by late-2026, assuming execution and broader $BTC strength. Against a current presale price of $0.013325, that’s an ROI of over 547% if everything lines up. That is not a guarantee; it’s a roadmap-plus-sentiment scenario. But it explains why some traders are rotating a slice of their ‘$MSTR proxy’ play into a direct Layer-2 bet instead. 🐳 Under the hood, the presale numbers are already big enough that this isn’t just a niche side quest anymore. $HYPER has raised over $28.45M. We’ve also seen some impressive whale buys as high as $502.6K, showing smart-money confidence. On top of that, staking has become its own flywheel. Currently, staking APY is 41%, with close to 1.3B $HYPER already locked. In practice, that means a big chunk of supply is out of circulation before the token even lists, which can dampen initial sell pressure if demand holds up. The flip side is obvious: high APYs don’t last forever, and when cliffs, unlocks, or yield rotations kick in, late entrants can get clipped hard. Timeline-wise, the project is targeting mainnet launch around Q4 2025/Q1 2026, with exchange listings and a DAO rollout following in 2026 to handle governance and developer grants. That lines up almost perfectly with the MSCI decision window. 🚀 Get in on the $HYPER action before the next price increase.

    "title": "Solana Nears $140 As Crypto Rotates Back to Risk: Could Maxi Doge Run Next?",
    "body": "What to Know: Solana’s move back toward $140, powered by strong ETF inflows and rising network revenue, signals a broader return of risk appetite in crypto. Fresh institutional interest in non-Bitcoin assets often precedes capital rotating into smaller caps and meme coins with higher volatility and upside. Maxi Doge uses meme culture plus staking, contests, and partner events to turn speculative energy into a more structured holder incentive model. The $MAXI presale, already above $4M raised with live staking, targets degen traders seeking yield-backed meme exposure in a renewed bull backdrop. Solana is back, flirting with $140, and the market finally looks like it remembers what a bull run feels like. Spot data shows $SOL trading in the high $130s , with a market cap around $76B and solid 24-hour volume; the kind of liquidity that tells you big players are back in the game. The new driver this time isn’t just hype. Solana has posted roughly $2.85B in annualized network revenue , and its spot ETFs have pulled in more than $380M in net inflows within weeks of launch. A second wave of SOL ETFs has already hit the market, with cumulative inflows pushing past $480M as funds try to front-run a potential next leg higher. That’s serious money signaling it’s willing to go further out on the risk curve than just Bitcoin. When institutions are comfortable owning $SOL through ETFs, you’re looking at a market that’s shifting from survival mode back to opportunity mode. Historically, that’s when capital starts hunting for higher beta plays, from smaller caps to full-blown meme coins. In the last cycle, that rotation carried Dogecoin and Shiba Inu to eye-watering returns once the majors had already moved. This time, the meme meta looks different: communities want culture, but they also want utility and yield. That’s where Maxi Doge ($MAXI) slots in; an Ethereum-based meme coin that wraps degen leverage culture around staking rewards, trading contests, and partner events. $MAXI positions itself as a way to lean into the risk-on mood around $SOL, one of the best altcoins , not just buying another dog logo and hoping. Maxi Doge Turns Meme Volatility Into Staking-Powered Upside Maxi Doge ’s core pitch is simple: take the over-caffeinated, 1000x-leverage trader archetype and turn it into a meme coin with actual on-chain incentives. The mascot is a body-builder Doge who never skips leg day, but beneath the jokes there’s a basic structure designed to keep holders engaged rather than just praying for a one-and-done pump. The token lives on Ethereum, which immediately solves liquidity and access: you can come in with $ETH, $BNB, stablecoins, or even a bank card via the presale widget, then later trade on Uniswap and (if the roadmap plays out) centralized exchanges. Smart-contract audits from firms like SolidProof and Coinsult reassure traders who like memes but also like their funds to actually be there tomorrow. Community trumps utility, but $MAXI holders get extra benefits. First, staking: $MAXI holders can lock tokens into a rewards pool that distributes yield via smart contract, currently 73% APY Second, $MAXI trading contests, where high-ROI traders and active community members can compete for extra rewards Third, proposed partner events that aim to plug Maxi Doge into third-party platforms The tokenomics lean heavily into growth. Out of a 150.24B maximum supply, 40% is allocated to marketing, while a further 25% is held in the Maxi Fund, all aimed at driving virality and adoption. That’s aggressive, but it matches the goal: saturate degen culture feeds while giving early buyers a meaningful allocation. Nobody should confuse $MAXI with a complex DeFi protocol. This is a culture token with staking and incentives layered on top. If that’s appealing, learn how to buy $MAXI. In a market where Solana is proving that users still love high-speed trading, NFTs, and meme coins, that blend of narrative and yield is exactly what many retail traders are looking for. Watch Maxi Doge if you’re leaning into the meme-plus-utility narrative. Inside the Maxi Doge Presale as Capital Hunts Higher Beta The $MAXI presale is structured in stages. Right now, entries are $0.00027 with nearly $4.19M already raised. Staking is live during the presale itself. That means early buyers aren’t just parking capital and waiting; they can immediately start compounding, which helps explain why billions of tokens are already locked. In a macro backdrop where Solana ETFs are soaking up institutional flows, and traders expect a broader alt rotation, being able to put a meme bag to work is a strong differentiator versus old-school ‘just hold and hope’ coins. The roadmap is very on-brand but surprisingly clear. After closing the presale, the project plans a DEX launch (with Uniswap v3 flagged as the first stop), followed by CEX listings and partnerships with futures platforms to push the high-leverage narrative. That narrative is succeeding; major whale purchases include two $314K token buys (here’s the on-chain proof ). None of this guarantees performance, and meme coins remain some of the riskiest assets you can touch in crypto. But in a cycle where Solana approaching $140 signals a renewed appetite for risk, a project like Maxi Doge – meme-heavy, $ETH-native, audited, and wrapped in staking incentives – is exactly the sort of asset many traders will want on their watchlist. Track the $MAXI presale while it’s open. This article is informational only, not financial advice. Crypto and meme coins are highly volatile; always do independent research before investing.

    "title": "What Happens If Dogecoin Moves Out Of This Massive Wyckoff Accumulation?",
    "body": "After hitting a new two-year peak back in 2024, the Dogecoin price had trended downward, and the result of this was a move into a major accumulation trend. Since then, the meme coin has been caught in this accumulation trend, with the majority of the price action favoring a bearish market. But with the tides changing, there could be a different approach for the cryptocurrency as Dogecoin flashes what seems to be an end to the accumulation trend. The Wyckoff Accumulation Holding Back Dogecoin Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade shared that the Dogecoin price has been caught in a massive Wyckoff Accumulation, which is the main thing that has kept the price down. However, there is still hope for the meme coin if it is able to break out of this accumulation trend. Related Reading: Top Analyst Sounds Alarm: Bitcoin Is Highly Unlikely To Spring Back Anytime Soon Pointing to the 5-Phase theory, the analyst explained that Dogecoin could be getting set to break out after completing Phase C of the cycle. As Trader Tardigrade explains, Phase C is always the lowest of all of the phases, meaning its completion could mean that the Dogecoin price is now nearing a bottom. If this bottom is completely formed at this level, then it could end the Wyckoff Accumulation, which apparently began back in 2024. The end of this year-long accumulation is entirely bullish and could propel the price even further than expected. As for the last two phases of the 5-phase theory, Phase D and Phase E, the analyst also shared what to expect. For Phase D, the Dogecoin price is expected to be pushed back toward the resistance that is mounting above $0.16, a level that has proven difficult in the past. Related Reading: XRP Approaches Macro Breakdown Zone, Analyst Warns About One Final Leg Lower The last and final stage of this, Phase E, is the most bullish of all, and could propel Dogecoin’s price toward new yearly highs. This phase is expected to send the meme coin’s price back above the accumulation range between $0.29 and $0.3, signaling an end to the massive Wyckoff Accumulation. Interestingly, Dogecoin’s open interest has crashed toward yearly lows, which suggests that this is a good time for buyers to step in for the meme coin. With open interest sitting at #1.3 billion compared to its $6 billion all-time high, according to data from Coinglass, DOGE could be uniquely positioned for a major breakout as the crypto market rebounds.

    "title": "Next Crypto to Explode? Best Wallet Token Presale Ends in 3 Days with $17.4M Raised",
    "body": "What to Know: Crypto users still face fragmented, clunky wallet experiences, forced to juggle multiple apps, bridges, and DEXs just to access basic DeFi and presale opportunities. Many leading wallets remain either centralized with potential custodial risks or decentralized but unintuitive on mobile, offering few meaningful rewards or value-add features for long-term users. Best Wallet Presale aims to become the best crypto wallet by 2026, targeting 40% market share with a secure, mobile-first, feature-rich, non-custodial design. The project combines Fireblocks-powered MPC security, a vetted presale discovery portal, cross-chain DEX aggregation, and $BEST staking rewards into one unified Web3 command center. After a chaotic year of altcoin whiplash, one trend has cut through the noise: investors are still piling into infrastructure projects that actually make crypto easier to use. Meme coins spike, vanish, and reappear like seasonal allergies, but everyone still needs a secure, mobile-first way to hold, swap, and earn without battling clunky UX or playing hide-and-seek with custodians. It’s no surprise, then, that wallet innovation has quietly become one of crypto’s fiercest battlegrounds. The problem? The best crypto wallets in this space come with baggage. Some are polished but basically centralized front-ends in disguise. Others are proudly non-custodial but feel like they were designed by someone who has never onboarded a new user in their life. And if you’ve ever bounced between three wallets, a bridge, and two DEX tabs just to buy a presale token or chase a yield pool… you already know the experience is overdue for a reboot. Enter the Best Wallet Presale , which pitches a very simple idea: what if the ‘best crypto wallet’ actually lived up to its name? Think security, presale access, cross-chain swaps, staking, and a clean mobile interface, all in one app. No Frankenstein toolkit. No duct-taped workflow. Just a single control center for your crypto life, whether you’re buying your first $50 of BTC or juggling a multi-chain DeFi setup. And the ambition doesn’t stop there. The team wants to grab 40% of the global crypto wallet market by the end of 2026, a bold target, but backed by a straightforward playbook: launch a feature-heavy, non-custodial wallet, reward $BEST holders with real perks, and use the presale’s momentum to jump-start user growth. With only three days left in the token sale and analysts already debating where the $BEST token could land, this is shaping up to be one of the most aggressive wallet pushes of the year. Best Wallet Presale Targets the “All-In-One” User Experience Best Wallet is pitching itself as the crypto super-app people keep asking for but never quite get: a next-gen, non-custodial wallet that doesn’t force you to choose between security, usability, or actual features. Its mobile-first interface bundles Fireblocks MPC-CMP security with custom multi-wallet portfolios and native support for thousands of assets (soon to expand across 50+ chains). It gives both newcomers and hardcore DeFi users the same clean, unified experience. But where Best Wallet really separates itself is in the extras most competitors skip. Its Upcoming Tokens portal surfaces curated presales with a frictionless purchase flow. At the same time, the Best DEX aggregator, powered by Rubic, searches across multiple chains, DEXs, and cross-chain bridges to find optimal routes. Instead of being just another place to store your assets, the wallet becomes the discovery engine for new opportunities, tying directly into the presale and DeFi narratives driving recent price-prediction hype. So far, the strategy seems to be landing. The presale has pulled in over $17.4M, with tokens priced at $0.025995, signaling strong demand for a wallet that fuses security, yield, presale access, and lower trading fees. Add in exclusive benefits for $BEST holders, and the vision becomes clear: your wallet shouldn’t just hold your crypto, it should help you grow it. $BEST Price Outlook, Staking Incentives, and Whale Interest If the Best Wallet Presale captures even 5% of the global crypto wallet market, $BEST price forecasts put the token at a $0.05 high in 2026, nearly a 2x jump from the current presale price of $0.025995. Nothing is guaranteed, but the math shows how a relatively small slice of a massive market can translate into meaningful price repricing. For investors tracking the next breakout token, now is the time to understand $BEST before it hits exchanges. Momentum is already building behind the scenes. Smart money wallets have started accumulating, with big whale buys of between $50K and $70K . For early-stage infrastructure tokens, concentrated accumulation like this often shows up before retail notices, typically right as the mobile app rolls out and real utility goes live. The tokenomics also lean into long-term alignment rather than hype trading. $BEST is an ERC-20 token with 8% of supply (800M tokens) dedicated to staking rewards (currently giving 75% APY). APY scales based on your share, and staking is already live during the presale, allowing early buyers to start compounding before the exchange trading begins. Staking isn’t just a yield mechanic; it’s a key part of the app’s ecosystem design. $BEST stakers are positioned to unlock higher yields via the upcoming in-app staking aggregator, reduced transaction fees across supported networks, and potential boosts or priority allocations for vetted presales featured in the wallet’s discovery portal. In short: stake $BEST to get more out of the entire ecosystem. As the mobile app, cross-chain DEX aggregator, and presale discovery hub gain traction, the flywheel becomes obvious: more users → more activity → more fee savings and perks for $BEST holders → stronger incentives to stake and hold. For anyone looking for a wallet-focused token with real utility rather than recycled hype cycles, this narrative is worth keeping an eye on. With just days left in the presale and more than $17.4M already committed, Best Wallet is heading into launch with the capital to ship features, complete audits, and scale marketing. Suppose the team delivers on its mobile-first UX and continues to curate high-quality presales and DeFi integrations. In that case, Best Wallet’s utility token has a real chance to graduate from a ‘speculative crypto’ to a ‘daily-use asset.’ Get $BEST tokens before the presale ends.

    "title": "XRP Has Just Flashed ‘The Real Signal’, Analyst Reveals Where Price Is Headed",
    "body": "The XRP price is showing signs of recovery after crashing under $2 earlier last week due to broader market volatility and decline. With its renewed momentum, analysts are now sharing optimistic projections about its future trajectory. New reports from market expert, Egrag Crypto, highlight the reappearance of a crucial technical signal that could trigger a major trend reversal for XRP. Based on the formation of this signal, XRP may be positioning for an explosive price surge that contradicts the previous bearish developments. XRP Price Chart Forms Bullish EMA Cross Signal Egrag Crypto has described the cross between two key Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) as “the real signal.” In his X post shared on Monday, he presented an in-depth review of XRP’s 3-day chart, focusing on the interaction between the 50-day and 200-day EMA and predicting how this technical signal could impact the cryptocurrency’s future price action. Related Reading: Attack On Cardano Founder Leads To Network Halt, What Really Happened? Egrag Crypto emphasized that many traders have interpreted the narrowing distance between these two key EMAs as the early stages of a bear market. However, his analysis shows that this interpretation does not match the XRP’s technical structure. For a genuine bearish cross to confirm a downward trend, XRP’s price would need to fall decisively below both EMAs as overall momentum begins to weaken. Currently, XRP sits above the 200 EMA, with the long-term trend line still rising, indicating underlying strength rather than a classic bear market setup. This suggests the cryptocurrency may be gradually building momentum to break out of its ongoing downtrend and move to higher levels. Egrag Crypto’s chart shows that XRP’s present structure contrasts sharply with its 2018 setup. During that cycle, XRP’s price had collapsed long before the two EMAs crossed, implying that the bearish crossover signal was more of a confirmation than the cause of the weakness. Based on the chart analysis, XRP’s present market structure lacks the characteristics of this historical event, suggesting that the cryptocurrency may be holding firm at levels that could yield more bullish outcomes than before. Where The XRP Price Is Headed Continuing his analysis, Egrag Crypto explained that the latest XRP chart setup looks more like the structures seen before its historic bull rallies in 2017 and early 2021. During those bullish cycles, the 500/200 EMAs had tightened, and XRP had remained above the 200 EMA. Related Reading: Will The Low XRP Price Force Ripple To Dump Its Holdings? Exec Answers Community Egrag Crypto noted that the market also entered a compression phase in both years, leading to sharp increases in volatility and explosive price surges. According to the analyst, each time XRP emerged from these conditions, it produced some of its most aggressive vertical moves. Notably, XRP’s current price chart reflects similar patterns. Egrag Crypto has said the cryptocurrency may be experiencing “late-cycle consolidation” rather than the beginning of a prolonged downtrend. Compression phases of this type often indicate that momentum is building beneath the surface. Based on its structure, the analyst has predicted that the XRP price is likely to head toward its final upside leg rather than a completed top.

    "title": "Why Has The Solana Price Been Crashing Since October? This Major SOL Player Is Selling",
    "body": "On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain has provided insights into what may have contributed to the Solana price crash since October. The platform revealed that meme coin launchpad Pump.fun has sold a significant amount of SOL, cashing out almost $500 million since the start of October. Pump.fun Allegedly Dumps SOL Amid Solana Price Crash In an X post, Lookonchain suggested that Pump.fun has been selling SOL, as it appears that the meme coin launchpad has cashed out at least 436.5 million USDC since October 15. The on-chain analytics platform also stated that since October 15, the meme coin launchpad has deposited 436.5 million USDC into Kraken. Related Reading: Forget XRP, DFDV Exec Predicts Solana Price Is Headed For $10,000 Furthermore, Lookonchain revealed that between May 19, 2024, and August 12, 2025, Pump.fun sold a total of 4.19 million SOL ($757 million) at an average price of $181. Of that amount, 264,373 SOL was sold on-chain for $41.64 million, while 3.93 million SOL ($715.5 million) was deposited into Kraken. Pump.fun’s SOL sales are known to put significant selling pressure on the Solana price, thereby contributing to its crash. Notably, the Solana price has recorded one of the largest losses during this recent crypto market downtrend. SOL crashed from a high of around $220 in October to a low of $120 this month. This has occurred despite the launch of six spot Solana ETFs during this period. Bitwise, Grayscale, Fidelity, 21Shares, VanEck, and Canary have all launched their SOL funds and have recorded notable flows since launch. SoSo Value data shows that these funds have recorded cumulative net inflows of $568.24 million since their respective listings. Despite this, the Solana price has been in a downtrend amid significant selling pressure from SOL whales. Thanks to the crash, SOL is now down over 28% year-to-date (YTD). The altcoin is also down over 28% in the last 30 days. Pump.fun Denies Recent SOL Sales A Pump.fun spokesperson, Sapijiju, has indicated that they haven’t sold any SOL recently and haven’t contributed to the Solana price crash. In an X post, he described Lookonchain’s post as complete misinformation, as they haven’t cashed any sum. He claimed they were not involved in the transactions between Kraken and Circle that the on-chain analytics platform referenced. Related Reading: Institutions Have Been Buying Solana Every Day For 2 Weeks, Is $300 Possible? Lookonchain had claimed that during the same period, Pump.fun allegedly cashed out 436.5 million USDC, 537.6 million USDC was sent from Kraken to Circle. Meanwhile, regarding the 436.5 million USDC, Sapijiju stated that what is happening is part of their treasury management, with the USDC part of funds from the PUMP ICO, and with plans to reinvest the sum into the business. At the time of writing, the Solana price is trading at around $138, up almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Freepik, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "title": "How High Can XRP Still Go This Cycle? Chartist Says $8 Possible",
    "body": "XRP traders are once again arguing about upside targets after popular chartist Charting Guy reposted a bullish long-term setup and doubled down on his call that XRP can still reach $8 this cycle. “XRP still going to $8, idc,” he wrote on X in the early hours of Nov. 25, alongside a weekly XRP/USD chart from Bitstamp. XRP Price Still Has Room To Run At the time of the screenshot, XRP was trading around $2.25, up roughly 9.8% on the week, with the chart plotting an Elliott Wave structure from early 2023 into a projected peak in 2026. The analysis is built on a dense Fibonacci framework spanning from about $0.25 to a 1.272 extension at $8.29661, which anchors his upside target. The green wave count shows a classic five-wave impulse. Wave 1 launches from the post-bear-market base into the 0.618 Fibonacci level near $0.915, where the first leg tops out. Wave 2 then retraces for 51 weekly bars (357 days), bottoming just above the 0.382 retracement at $0.41315. Related Reading: XRP Real Purpose: Documentation Shows Payment Utility Contrary To Viral Claims — Details Wave 3 is drawn as a steep rally off that base, blasting through all mid-range Fibonacci bands and extending beyond the 1.0 level at $3.31700. In the replies, one user suggested the spike to around $3.65 had already completed the fifth wave; Charting Guy rejected that outright: “it wasn’t… was very clearly a B wave.” From that high, the chart records a year-long consolidation labelled as Wave 4, annotated as 50 weekly bars (350 days). Price fluctuates between roughly the mid-$2 area and above $3. The Wave-4 low holds above the 0.786 Fibonacci support at $1.61246, never revisiting the $1 region. From this consolidation, the projected Wave 5 shoots higher from around the $2–$2.30 zone—where XRP is currently trading—toward the 1.272 extension at $8.29661. The “5” marker sits at this level, and the projection shows only a modest pullback after touching the band, implying that this area is treated as the probable cycle cap. Related Reading: XRP Hits Exact Bull Target as Top Traders Celebrate Perfect Market Call The Fibonacci grid also frames the current battle zone. XRP’s price is oscillating around the 0.888 level at $2.27404, which lines up almost exactly with the latest weekly close, while the prior wave-3 region around $3.317 remains the next major resistance band on the chart. Not everyone is convinced. “Could still go under 1.50. Still,” wrote another user. Charting Guy’s response was curt: “no.” That stance matches the technical layout: in his count, the $1.61 area has already printed the Wave-4 low, and the structure does not include another trip below that support. Others pushed for higher numbers. “Was hoping for $20+,” one follower admitted. “could happen,” the analyst replied—before clarifying to another user that “$20 is not on track but still entirely possible.” His published chart, however, draws no path beyond the $8.29 extension, underlining that mid-single-digit territory remains his primary target for this cycle. At press time, XRP traded at $2.20. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "title": "Financial Strategist Debunks Prediction That Bitcoin Price Will Reach $220,000 In 45 Days",
    "body": "A recent claim that the Bitcoin price could surge to $220,000 in just 45 days has drawn sharp criticism from a financial strategist. The analyst frames such ambitious forecasts as unrealistic and highly speculative. Considering the recent decline in the BTC market, if the projection is taken at face value without supporting data, it overlooks ongoing market trends, macroeconomic conditions, and potential investor risks. Strategist Labels $220,000 Bitcoin Price Forecast “Nonsense” South Korean scientist YoungHoon Kim, who holds the world’s highest reported IQ of 276, recently predicted that Bitcoin could more than double its current price and reach $220,000 within 45 days. Based on this forecast, the BTC price is expected to surge by over 151% from current levels below $87,500, potentially reaching a new all-time high by mid-January 2026. Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Price Action With Chinese Astrology Shares When Prices Will Surge With Bitcoin down more than 31% from its ATH above $126,000, the bold forecast came as a surprise to many crypto members. The founder of Black Swan Capitalist, Versan Aljarrah, in particular, criticized the projection, calling it “nonsense.” He described it as an example of the speculative behavior that has long characterized the crypto space. Aljarrah argued that predictions like Kim’s, which lack the visible support of a technical analysis, are what transform the crypto space into a “circus.” He highlighted that Bitcoin maxis will often go to extreme lengths to sustain the hype, promoting narratives that keep the speculative bubble alive even when market fundamentals raise caution. The Black Swan Capitalist founder also disclosed that Bitcoin has historically functioned more as a tool for predators and bad actors. His statements suggest that Kim’s forecast oversimplifies the complexities of the crypto market and distracts investors and traders from the fundamental structural factors driving Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin Price Continues To Falter Amidst Bullish Forecasts The Bitcoin market remains at a crossroads, with analysts forecasting sharp upward moves despite choppy price action. Despite predictions of a potential rally, BTC’s recent performance paints a more cautious picture, as its price has fallen by more than 20% over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap. Related Reading: Why Bitwise Thinks Bitcoin Still Hits $200,000 In 2026 Crypto analyst Pepesso recently issued a bullish forecast, suggesting that Bitcoin may have hit its bottom and could potentially start a recovery toward levels between $126,000 and $160,000. However, broader market indicators, such as the Fear and Greed Index, point to extreme fear, suggesting investors remain highly uncertain about BTC’s near-term outlook. Other analysts, like Gen Detector, have presented a more conservative outlook, predicting that Bitcoin could first stabilize around the $100,000 psychological level before its next bear wave begins. However, he has not ruled out the likelihood of further price corrections, highlighting the potential for BTC to revisit the $70,000 to $50,000 range before the next major bull run.

    "title": "Hamas Victims Sue Binance And CZ — Accusations Of Terror Financing Rock Crypto World",
    "body": "Based on reports, victims of the October 7 attacks in Israel have filed a federal lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, claiming the exchange allowed large crypto flows to militant groups. Related Reading: Bitcoin Creator Somehow Becomes ‘Poor’ By Losing $41 Billion Without Saying A Word The complaint lists 306 American plaintiffs who say they were killed, injured, or taken hostage and are demanding damages. Dormant Accounts Draw Scrutiny According to the filing, the plaintiffs allege Binance helped move more than $1 billion for Hamas and other US-designated groups over several years. They claim that more than $50 million passed through the platform after the October 7, 2023 assault. These figures sit at the center of the case and could shape the request for compensatory and treble damages. The complaint also highlights unusual account activity that lawyers say should have triggered alarms. One example involves an account tied to a Venezuelan woman linked to a Brazilian livestock business. Binance Holdings faces a lawsuit claiming the cryptocurrency platform “knowingly facilitated” crypto transactions by Hamas before the group attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages. https://t.co/B3rO7bAjN6 — The Japan Times (@japantimes) November 25, 2025 Reports say the account received over $177 million in deposits after opening in 2022 and later sent out more than $130 million in withdrawals. Attorneys argue that movements of this size should have been examined more closely. Large Sums And Strange Flows Based on reports, the plaintiffs argue that Binance’s controls were weak or ignored, allowing questionable transfers to move across borders. The lawsuit lists alleged links to Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. Lawyers claim the platform became a tool for shifting money while avoiding standard financial checks. Binance has said it complies with international sanctions laws and has denied having any special ties to terrorist groups. Its legal history forms part of the background: in late 2023, the company pleaded guilty in a major federal case and paid a $4.32 billion penalty tied to anti-money-laundering and sanctions violations. That earlier case, along with Zhao’s four-month prison sentence, is referenced in the new complaint. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sudden Volatility Jump Signals Options Could Be Calling The Shots—Analyst Legal Stakes And Future Impact The new lawsuit seeks damages under a US anti-terrorism law that can triple any award. If the plaintiffs succeed, the financial and reputational impact on Binance could be severe. The complaint was filed in federal court in North Dakota and is separate from another case in Manhattan that is already moving through the court system. The filing also recalls that Zhao’s prison sentence was later followed by a pardon from US President Donald Trump, something the plaintiffs point to as part of the exchange’s complicated legal path. They argue this new lawsuit is necessary to push for accountability after years of what they see as weak controls. Featured image from alliance / Zumapress.com, chart from TradingView",

    "title": "XRP OI Collapses to Lowest Level Since Nov 2024: Binance Data Shows Liquidity Is Fading",
    "body": "XRP is under heavy selling pressure as the broader crypto market struggles with uncertainty, risk aversion, and fading bullish momentum. Fear continues to spread across investors, and liquidity conditions are tightening, putting additional weight on assets that previously demonstrated strength. Related Reading: Bitmine Scoops Up Another 28,625 Ethereum ($82.1M) as Market Bleeds – Details One of the clearest signs of stress now comes from Binance data — the largest trading platform by volume — showing that XRP Open Interest has dropped to its lowest level since November 2024. This decline highlights a significant shift in trader positioning, signaling that speculative appetite is drying up and leverage is being unwound across the market. According to the latest derivatives metrics, XRP is entering a critical phase marked by weakening sentiment and a steady loss of momentum. The sharp contraction in Open Interest reflects reduced participation from both long and short traders, suggesting that the market currently lacks conviction to support a sustained directional move. This shift comes at a time when XRP had previously been attempting to stabilize above key psychological levels, but continued selling pressure has prevented a clean rebound. XRP Derivatives Show Liquidity Drain and Bearish Control A CryptoQuant report from Arab Chain reveals a sharp deterioration in XRP derivatives conditions, highlighting growing stress across the market. Open Interest on Binance has fallen dramatically from record highs above $1.7 billion to nearly $504 million, and briefly down to $473 million. This steep contraction reflects a major outflow of liquidity from both long and short positions, signaling that traders no longer have the conviction needed to sustain a clear directional trend. The decline in OI aligns closely with XRP’s price drop to $2, after trading above the $2.5–$3 range in recent weeks. This correlation suggests that traders are not reopening positions after being flushed out, leaving the market driven by short-term flows rather than sustained accumulation. Funding rates reinforce this weakness. Over the past two months, funding has frequently turned negative, showing that short sellers are willing to pay to maintain their positions. Negative funding typically indicates that selling pressure outweighs buying demand, increasing the probability of continued downside unless fresh liquidity enters the market. Taken together — collapsing Open Interest, persistent negative funding, and declining price action — the data paints a picture of deep fragility. There are no visible signs of meaningful accumulation from whales or institutions, and without a reversal in derivatives behavior, XRP remains firmly under seller control. Related Reading: 63K Bitcoin Exits Long-Term Wallets: A Surge of Speculative Short-Term Buying XRP Price Shows Weak Rebound After Breakdown XRP continues to struggle under heavy market pressure, and the chart reflects a clear loss of bullish structure. After failing to hold above the $2.50–$2.70 range, price broke down sharply and recently tagged lows near $1.90 before attempting a modest rebound. The rejection from the 50-day and 100-day moving averages shows that sellers remain firmly in control, with both moving averages now sloping downward — a sign of sustained bearish momentum. Additionally, XRP remains below the 200-day moving average, reinforcing the broader downside bias and signaling that the market has not yet regained long-term support. Related Reading: Anti-CZ Whale Loses Big: $61M in Profit Wiped Out As Ethereum and XRP Longs Collapse Volume spikes during selloffs highlight capitulation-driven moves rather than accumulation, while the weaker volume on recent green candles suggests limited conviction behind the bounce. Each recovery attempt has been met with resistance, forming lower highs and lower lows — a classic bearish continuation pattern. To shift sentiment, XRP would need to reclaim the $2.40 level and consolidate above it; otherwise, the risk of retesting $1.90 or even falling toward $1.70 remains elevated.

    "title": "XRP Price Will Climb Above $10 When This Happens: Analyst",
    "body": "Bitcoin dominance is currently sitting around the mid-50% range, and although it has not shown any dramatic breakdown yet, some traders are beginning to watch for signs of rotation. Data from platforms that track market share show Bitcoin dominance slowly pushing to the mid-fifties, but projections suggesting a future decline are forming the basis of new discussions in the XRP community. One such projection comes from an XRP enthusiast known as DROP, who shared a chart illustrating a steep fall in Bitcoin dominance that he believes will unlock XRP’s next major rally to double digits. Bitcoin Dominance Projection Shows A Breakdown Zone The chart shared by DROP outlines a scenario where Bitcoin dominance trends sideways for a while before sliding into the low-40% region. This projected decline is highlighted by a wide purple zone extending into 2026. The expectation is that a major rotation into altcoins, most especially XRP, would begin once dominance loses its current structure. Related Reading: Here’s How High The XRP Price Needs To Be To Flip Bitcoin Although Bitcoin’s dominance has fallen quite a bit from its 60% range where it was circulating in October, it has fairly held up even when it fell to as low as $81,000 on November 21. The last time Bitcoin’s dominance was as low as 40% was in early 2023. The idea behind the projection is not that another fall in dominance has already begun, but that the dominance is in a region where it could crash if market conditions change. According to DROP, this is the moment that will cement the beginning of XRP’s strongest move of the cycle. It is from here that the XRP price runs to double digits. Double-Digit XRP Dependent On A Crypto Market Transition XRP has often been one of the few assets that have shown the ability to outperform Bitcoin, especially when traders rotate into large-cap tokens that have lagged behind Bitcoin during the early part of a cycle. Related Reading: XRP Price Has Surged 15% Anytime This Metric Appeared In The Past This pattern was visible in both January and July 2025. The January 2025 move pushed XRP above $3 for the first time since 2018, and the July 2025 move saw the XRP price register a new all-time high. The projection by DROP positions XRP as one of the likely gainers once market share begins to redistribute away from Bitcoin. This has not happened yet, and current dominance readings reflect stability rather than collapse. The projection centers on what could occur when the market enters the next altcoin rotation phase. If dominance eventually drops toward the low-40% range, then the conditions might just be right for XRP to break out above $10. These conditions include retail and institutional participation, deeper liquidity from large investors, and meaningful inflows into XRP ETFs to sustain such an advance to double digits.

    "title": "Solana Rebounds Strong as Massive ETF Inflows Reinforce $128 Support Zone",
    "body": "Solana (SOL) is staging an impressive comeback as renewed institutional demand supports the network’s key support levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Less Than 50% Chance Of Hitting $100,000 By December 31, Says AI Model The latest surge in investor interest, led by a record-breaking inflow into Bitwise’s Solana ETF, has helped the asset stabilize after weeks of market turbulence, offering fresh optimism for a potential trend reversal. SOL's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Record Solana ETF Inflows Signal Renewed Institutional Confidence Bitwise Asset Management recorded a historic $39.5 million single-day inflow into its Solana ETF, the largest since the product launched. The milestone reflects a clear shift in institutional portfolios toward high-utility blockchain assets, with Solana increasingly emerging as a preferred choice beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The network’s reputation for speed, scalability, and active ecosystem continues to anchor demand, with institutional investors prioritizing blockchains that demonstrate real-world functionality. This surge in ETF interest comes despite broader market volatility. Recent weeks saw nearly $1.94 billion in total outflows across crypto investment products, one of the largest downturns since 2018. Yet, Solana ETF performance shows institutions are not withdrawing from the market entirely, they are reallocating capital toward networks with measurable usage and long-term growth potential. Solana Price Rebounds as Key Supports Hold Firm After dropping to $121.50 on Friday, Solana rebounded sharply to reclaim the $135–$140 range, marking a 14% recovery. Despite a 30% decline over the last month, SOL has shown notable resilience. The asset continues to hold above the crucial $125–$130 support band, a zone analysts describe as the foundation of Solana’s current market structure. Derivatives markets, however, still reflect caution. Negative funding rates and declining open interest indicate traders remain defensive, with sentiment yet to fully align with the positive ETF inflows. Even so, on-chain activity paints a more optimistic picture. Solana leads all major networks in active addresses and daily transactions, with user activity increasing 13% over the past month, even as Ethereum’s activity declined 15%. ETF Strength and On-Chain Utility Shape Solana’s Next Move The junction of strong ETF demand and robust network fundamentals suggests Solana could be positioned for a broader recovery, provided it maintains the $125 support level. Analysts point to $163, $170, and eventually $195–$243 as potential upside targets if buyers continue to absorb selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $40,000? Signal Behind Past 60% Crashes Is Back While macro uncertainty and recent market outflows still pose risks, Solana’s ability to withstand significant volatility, while attracting record institutional capital, signals enduring confidence in its long-term value. If current momentum holds, Solana may soon challenge higher resistance zones, backing its position as one of the most resilient high-utility blockchains in 2025.
