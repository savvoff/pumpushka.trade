# Technical Analysis

Pumpushka Bot incorporates a wide range of classical technical indicators that help evaluate trend, momentum, volatility, and volume.

## 1. Momentum Indicators

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** — identifies overbought and oversold zones.
* **Stochastic Oscillator** — highlights momentum shifts and short-term overbought/oversold conditions.
* **CCI (Commodity Channel Index)** — measures price deviation from its statistical mean.
* **Awesome Oscillator** — confirms trend momentum and detects early reversals.

## 2. Trend Indicators

* **EMA / SMA (Exponential / Simple Moving Averages)** — smooth price action and define trend direction.
* **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** — shows trend strength, crossovers, and divergences.
* **Parabolic SAR (PSAR)** — generates stop-and-reverse levels to indicate potential trend reversals.
* **Aroon Indicator** — measures time since recent highs/lows to identify trend direction.
* **ADX (Average Directional Index)** — quantifies the strength of a trend regardless of direction.
* **+DI / -DI (Directional Indicators)** — components of ADX, showing bullish vs bearish directional pressure.

## 3. Volatility & Range Indicators

* **Bollinger Bands** — define dynamic price ranges, volatility expansions, and squeezes.
* **ATR (Average True Range)** — measures realized volatility and is used to set stop-loss and take-profit levels.

## 4. Volume-Based Indicators

* **OBV (On-Balance Volume)** — tracks cumulative volume to confirm price trends.
* **CMF (Chaikin Money Flow)** — evaluates buying vs selling pressure by combining price and volume.

> All these indicators are combined with other factors (order book, derivatives, on-chain, sentiment) to form the **Rationale Score** and influence trade signals.
