# Pumpushka Bot — Introduction

**Pumpushka Bot** is an analytical Telegram bot that combines artificial intelligence, technical analysis, and market data.\
Its goal is to help traders quickly evaluate the market, see the strengths and weaknesses of a trade, and make informed decisions.

## Key Features

* Real-time automatic market analysis.
* Evaluation of over **50 factors**: technical indicators, order book, derivatives, sentiment, on-chain data, news, and macro events.
* TP/SL strategy presets with different risk levels (Normal, Aggressive, Conservative, Safe).
* **Rationale Score** system to measure trade quality.
* Instant alerts on signals and market events.

## How It Works

1. The bot collects data from exchange APIs and external sources.
2. Processes it through a factor system (with weights, time-decay, and correlations).
3. Generates a signal (long / short / none) with TP, SL, and success probability based on RRR.
4. Outputs results in a clear, concise format.

## Who It’s For

* **Beginner traders** — to avoid common mistakes and follow structured trade plans.
* **Experienced traders** — as a tool to validate scenarios and add an extra analytical layer.
* **Analysts & enthusiasts** — for fast market data aggregation and interpretation.

## Important

Pumpushka Bot **is not an auto-trading tool** and does not open trades for you.\
It acts as an analytical assistant to support your own decision-making.
