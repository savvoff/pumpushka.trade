## Overview

Ethereum (ETH) is currently undergoing a significant price breakout, facing a crucial test as it attempts to solidify a key area as support. Analysts are optimistic about the altcoin's potential for continued bullish momentum, suggesting that a major rotation could be on the horizon.

## Ethereum’s Current Price Movement

Recently, Ethereum broke past an important price level, retesting the $3,400 mark for the first time in over a month. This movement represents a 6% increase from the previous $3,100 level. Since the beginning of the year, ETH has been fluctuating between the $3,000 and $3,300 range, but last week it managed to close above this local range's upper boundary. The ability to maintain this position is crucial as Ethereum now tests this area as support.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe has indicated that Ethereum has been performing well, having held above the 21-day Moving Average (MA) since the start of the year. This moving average level is significant, as it was lost during early corrections in Q4 2025. Holding above this level is seen as essential for sustaining momentum. Van de Poppe believes that Ethereum is on the brink of new highs and may soon retest the $3,800 mark.

Another analyst, Daan Crypto Trades, emphasized that Ethereum is currently facing a major test. He noted that the cryptocurrency has been operating within a $2,600 to $3,300 price range for the past two months. A breakout from this range is necessary to determine the direction of Ethereum's next move. The $3,350 level, where the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) resides, is particularly important, as it has served as a key rejection area since November. A successful breakout above this level could lead to a price increase toward the $3,600 area.

## Analyst Perspectives

Crypto Jelle expressed a positive outlook, stating that Ethereum "looks better than it has looked in years" against both Bitcoin (BTC) and the US Dollar. He suggested that the downward trend against BTC has ended, and ETH is poised to push toward the $4,000 barrier. Similarly, Alex Wacy remarked that the "biggest ETH rotation in 8 years" is currently forming. He noted that Ethereum appears to be following a similar trajectory to its 2018 breakout against BTC, albeit with "bigger players" and "more capital entering" the market.

Historically, Ethereum experienced a multi-year accumulation against Bitcoin from 2015 to 2017, which led to a significant expansion in 2018. After an initial breakout, the cryptocurrency went through a re-accumulation phase within a falling wedge pattern, resulting in a substantial price increase. Currently, Ethereum's trading pair against BTC is again moving within a multi-year falling wedge pattern, which was broken out of in Q4 2025. If past patterns repeat, Ethereum could experience a major surge against Bitcoin in the coming months.

## From author

The current developments in Ethereum's price movement indicate a critical phase for the altcoin. The ability to hold above key support levels and break through resistance could potentially set the stage for a new bullish trend. Analysts' optimistic outlooks suggest that Ethereum is not only poised for growth against the US Dollar but also has the potential to perform favorably against Bitcoin.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Ethereum's recent breakout could influence investor sentiment across the altcoin market.
- A successful test of critical support levels may encourage more buying interest.
- Analysts predict a significant rotation in Ethereum, which could lead to increased capital inflow into the cryptocurrency space.
- Historical patterns suggest that a breakout could lead to substantial price increases, impacting market dynamics.
- Overall market volatility may arise if Ethereum's price movements trigger reactions from traders and investors alike.
