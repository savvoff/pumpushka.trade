## Overview

XRP has recently attempted a price recovery, climbing above the $1.950 mark but encountering significant resistance near the $2.00 level. As the price struggles to maintain its upward momentum, bearish signals are emerging, leading to speculation about a potential decline below $1.920.

## XRP Price Movement

XRP's price began a recovery wave after finding support above the $1.8650 level. This recovery was mirrored by other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, allowing XRP to rise above the $1.90 and $1.920 thresholds. The price even exceeded the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of a previous downward movement, which spanned from a swing high to a low. However, despite these positive movements, the bulls faced a major hurdle at the $2.00 resistance level.

As XRP attempted to break through the $2.00 barrier, it was met with selling pressure, causing the price to retreat. Currently, XRP is trading below the $2.00 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, indicating a bearish trend. A bearish trend line is also forming with resistance at the $2.00 mark on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. If XRP settles below $1.920, it could signal a continued downward trend.

The potential for further upward movement exists, but it is likely to encounter resistance near the $1.990 level and the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level of the earlier downward move. The first significant resistance remains at the $2.00 level, and a close above this threshold could lead to a price increase toward $2.0650. If the bulls manage to push the price above $2.10, they could target $2.150 and then $2.20 as the next levels of resistance.

Conversely, if XRP fails to break through the $2.00 resistance zone, it may initiate a fresh decline. The initial support on the downside is at the $1.920 level, followed by the $1.90 mark. A break below $1.90 could lead to further declines toward $1.8650 and potentially down to $1.820. Should the selling pressure persist, XRP could fall below $1.750.

## From author

The current situation surrounding XRP illustrates the volatility and uncertainty inherent in the cryptocurrency market. As the price fluctuates near key resistance and support levels, traders and investors are keenly observing market movements for potential trading opportunities. The struggle at the $2.00 resistance highlights the challenges faced by the asset in maintaining upward momentum, especially in a market that can shift rapidly.

## Impact on the crypto market

- XRP's failure to breach the $2.00 resistance may lead to increased bearish sentiment among traders.
- A decline below key support levels could trigger broader sell-offs in the cryptocurrency market.
- The correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum suggests that XRP's price movements may influence or be influenced by the broader market trends.
- The formation of bearish signals may deter new investors from entering the market, impacting liquidity.
- Resistance levels at $2.00 and $2.065 could serve as critical points for market participants to watch for future trading strategies.
