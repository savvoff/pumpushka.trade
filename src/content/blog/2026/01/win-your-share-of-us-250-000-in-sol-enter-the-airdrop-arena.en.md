## Overview

Crypto.com has introduced a new reward initiative within its Airdrop Arena, allowing users to earn rewards without the necessity of daily trading. The campaign features a substantial reward pool of SOL tokens, amounting to US$250,000, which will be distributed to participants who allocate CRO during the campaign.

## Campaign Details

The Airdrop Arena campaign is currently live and will continue throughout January. This initiative combines the CRO ecosystem of Crypto.com with Solana, recognized as one of the most active layer-1 networks in the cryptocurrency space. Unlike traditional trading competitions that emphasize high-volume trading, this campaign encourages users to engage steadily over time. Participants accumulate points during the event, and SOL rewards will be distributed based on the points collected once the campaign concludes.

### Simple Reward Structure

The reward system for the campaign is designed to be straightforward. Users are required to allocate CRO into the Airdrop Arena, thus earning points as long as the event is active. The amount of SOL each participant receives will correspond to the total points they have accumulated. 

In addition to the basic structure, Crypto.com is incentivizing early engagement. The first 10,000 users who allocate CRO will benefit from an exclusive points boost of up to 120%. Furthermore, users can qualify for a daily points boost of up to 120% by purchasing a minimum of 1,500 CRO and transferring it into Airdrop Arena, provided the purchase is completed before the CRO allocation.

### Participation Process

Participation in the Airdrop Arena is facilitated entirely through the Crypto.com app, making it accessible even for casual users. Airdrop Arena can be found in the Account section, the Earn tab, or the Supermenu. Once users access the feature, they can allocate CRO into the event and begin earning points automatically. This setup minimizes the need for constant monitoring or complex strategies, making it a more passive experience compared to active trading.

### Event Timeline and Reward Distribution

The campaign is set to run from a specified start to end time. Following the conclusion of the event, Crypto.com will calculate the points accrued by each participant and distribute SOL rewards accordingly. Rewards will be airdropped within seven days after the campaign ends. Users who have activated Loot Locker will receive their rewards after a designated lockup period, while those without it will see SOL distributed directly to their Crypto Wallet. It is important to note that allocated CRO will be locked for six months, encouraging longer-term engagement from users.

## From author

The launch of the Airdrop Arena reflects an evolving strategy in the crypto exchange landscape. By focusing on user loyalty and engagement rather than solely trading volume, Crypto.com aims to foster a community of long-term participants. This campaign not only incentivizes CRO holders but also aligns with broader trends in the industry, where exchanges are seeking to retain users through innovative reward structures.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The campaign promotes steady user engagement rather than high-frequency trading, potentially stabilizing market activity.
- By integrating CRO with SOL rewards, Crypto.com strengthens the relationship between its platform and the Solana ecosystem, which could enhance user interest in both assets.
- The initiative may encourage other exchanges to adopt similar loyalty-focused reward systems, leading to a shift in how trading platforms incentivize user participation.
- The lockup period for allocated CRO may lead to increased demand for CRO as users opt to participate in future campaigns.
- The focus on passive earning models could attract a broader audience who may have previously been deterred by the complexities of active trading.
