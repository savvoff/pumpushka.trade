## Overview

XRP has emerged as a standout performer in the cryptocurrency market, continuing its upward trajectory as 2026 begins. The token has recorded a significant surge, driven largely by strong demand for XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have attracted substantial inflows compared to other major cryptocurrencies.

## XRP's Performance and ETF Demand

In 2025, XRP was recognized as the best-performing token among the top ten largest cryptocurrencies, outpacing both Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the first week of 2026 unfolds, XRP has maintained this momentum, registering a 17% increase over the past week, which has pushed its price above the critical threshold of $2.20.

A key factor in this surge has been the strong performance of XRP ETFs, which have emerged as a notable player in the market. Over recent weeks, these ETFs have attracted $483 million in inflows. In stark contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have seen a significant outflow of $1.09 billion, while Ethereum products have faced a loss of $564 million. Notably, XRP funds achieved $483 million in inflows during December and enjoyed a continuous streak of inflows for 30 consecutive trading days. This streak ended on December 26, marking the first day of zero inflows.

Since their launch in November, total inflows into XRP ETFs have reached $1.3 billion, representing the fastest adoption rate for any altcoin ETF to date. 

## Future Prospects for XRP

Looking ahead, the ETF landscape appears to be crucial for the future performance of XRP. Reports indicate that a potential filing by BlackRock for an XRP ETF could provide a significant credibility boost, potentially attracting conservative institutional investors. This follows BlackRock’s success with its $40 billion Bitcoin ETF, which has effectively mobilized capital through its Aladdin platform connections.

Additionally, Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is scaling into banking and remittance services, which could create ongoing demand for XRP as a bridge asset. There are also indications that the Federal Reserve may implement multiple rate cuts in 2026, which could reduce the opportunity cost of investing in risk assets. 

## From author

The current bullish sentiment surrounding XRP is fueled by both its recent performance and the strong inflows into its ETFs. This trend highlights the growing interest in XRP as a viable investment option within the cryptocurrency space. The potential developments surrounding ETF filings and stablecoin integrations could further enhance XRP's market position in the coming months.
