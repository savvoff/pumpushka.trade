## Overview

A new controversy has emerged involving Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held by the US government. Allegations made by blockchain investigator ZachXBT suggest that John “Lick” Daghita has stolen millions of dollars’ worth of seized digital assets from government-linked wallets.

## Allegations of Theft

In a series of posts on the social media platform X, ZachXBT accused John Daghita, whose father Dean Daghita is the president of CMDSS—a firm that claims to provide critical services to the US Department of Justice and the Department of Defense—of controlling millions in stolen government crypto assets. The allegations surfaced after a young hacker became embroiled in a heated argument on the social media app Telegram. During this exchange, he began to screen-share his cryptocurrency wallets, showcasing his holdings.

The investigation revealed that the wallets displayed during this exchange were linked to over $40 million in seized crypto assets belonging to the US government. Additionally, ZachXBT's findings suggested that John Daghita was managing wallets associated with more than $90 million in suspected illicit funds. Among these assets were cryptocurrencies traced back to US government seizure addresses linked to the notable Bitfinex hack.

In the recordings analyzed by ZachXBT, John was seen actively managing multiple wallet addresses while transferring millions of dollars' worth of Ethereum and Tron in real time, indicating he had direct control over these funds.

## CMDSS's Response and John's Actions

Following the publicization of these allegations, CMDSS appeared to take drastic measures to eliminate its online presence. The company removed its website, X account, and LinkedIn page. Concurrently, John Daghita reportedly began altering his online identities, changing usernames, and deleting NFT-related handles from his Telegram account.

Despite these attempts to obscure his digital footprint, ZachXBT noted that John continued to mock investigators. He even sent a small amount of Ethereum from one of the flagged wallets to ZachXBT, who stated his intention to return those funds directly to a US government seizure address, reinforcing the claim that these assets rightfully belong to the government.

## From author

The allegations surrounding John Daghita and the potential theft of government-held crypto assets raise significant questions about security and oversight within the realm of digital currencies. The alleged ability to access and manage such large sums of money underscores vulnerabilities that may exist in tracking and securing seized digital assets. Additionally, the rapid actions taken by CMDSS and John Daghita to distance themselves from the allegations suggest a level of awareness regarding the gravity of the situation.

As investigations unfold, the implications for the involved parties and the broader crypto community could be profound, particularly in terms of regulatory scrutiny and the integrity of digital asset management.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Heightened scrutiny on the management of seized digital assets by government agencies could lead to increased regulatory measures.
- Potential loss of confidence in the security of government-held cryptocurrencies may affect market perceptions.
- The incident could spark discussions on the need for better tracking and transparency of digital assets.
- Increased attention on the role of blockchain investigators may lead to more thorough examinations of suspicious activities within the crypto space.
- The behavior of individuals involved in the theft allegations could influence public sentiment and trust in crypto technologies.
