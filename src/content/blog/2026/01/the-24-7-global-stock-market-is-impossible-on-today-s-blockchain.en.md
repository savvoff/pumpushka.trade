The current state of blockchain technology presents significant challenges for the establishment of a 24/7 global stock market. The existing infrastructure is characterized by inadequate throughput and systematic issues such as front-running. These limitations hinder the ability to meet the demands of real-world finance, which requires rapid transaction finality and fair ordering.

## Inadequate Throughput

The current blockchain systems struggle to handle the volume of transactions needed for a global stock market. Throughput refers to the number of transactions that can be processed in a given time frame. The existing technology does not support the high transaction rates necessary for real-time trading, which is essential for a functional and competitive stock market environment. 

## Systematic Front-Running

Another critical issue affecting blockchain's viability for stock trading is the prevalence of front-running. This practice occurs when someone takes advantage of advance knowledge of pending transactions to execute their own transactions first, thereby profiting at the expense of others. Front-running undermines the fairness and integrity of the trading process, making it a significant barrier to adopting blockchain for real-world financial applications.

## Demand for Sub-Second Finality

In the world of finance, speed is paramount. Transactions must be finalized in sub-second timeframes to facilitate fast-paced trading and maintain market efficiency. Current blockchain solutions do not offer the rapid confirmation times required, which can lead to delays and inefficiencies that are unacceptable in a global stock market context. 

## Fair Transaction Ordering

Equitable transaction ordering is crucial for maintaining trust in any trading system. When transactions are not ordered fairly, it can lead to market manipulation and a loss of confidence among investors. The existing blockchain infrastructure's inability to guarantee fair transaction ordering poses a significant risk to the establishment of a reliable and trustworthy trading environment.

## From author

The limitations of blockchain technology in its current form raise critical questions about its suitability for future financial markets. The challenges of throughput, front-running, finality, and transaction ordering highlight the need for advancements in blockchain infrastructure. Addressing these issues will be essential for realizing the vision of a decentralized and efficient global stock market.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The current blockchain limitations could hinder broader adoption of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance.
- The inability to support a global stock market may lead to a reliance on traditional financial systems.
- Issues like front-running could damage the reputation of blockchain technology among institutional investors.
- The demand for faster transaction finality may drive innovation in blockchain technology to overcome current limitations.
- Fair transaction ordering remains a critical focus for developers and stakeholders aiming to build trust in blockchain applications.
