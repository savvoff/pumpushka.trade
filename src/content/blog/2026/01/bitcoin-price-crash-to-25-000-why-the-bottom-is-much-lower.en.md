## Overview

Recent analyses from crypto experts highlight the potential for Bitcoin's price to decline significantly, with projections suggesting a possible drop to $25,000. This anticipated decline is viewed as a key moment in the cryptocurrency's market cycle, indicating a macro bottom before a potential recovery.

## Analysis of the Current Situation

Crypto analyst Crypto Whale has provided insights regarding Bitcoin's price trajectory, emphasizing that the monthly chart could indicate a macro bottom around $25,000, potentially occurring in 2026. The analyst suggests that such deep retracements have historically served as long-term accumulation zones. This assertion implies that the current market conditions do not mark the end of the price cycle but rather a necessary reset before the next phase of expansion.

In a subsequent analysis, Crypto Whale indicated that Bitcoin is not currently in a bear market. Instead, he forecasts a Bitcoin-led rally for the current month, followed by a broader altcoin expansion in February. However, he warns that a bull trap could emerge in March, which may trigger volatility and panic selling among investors.

The predictions continue with a forecast for May, where a capitulation phase is anticipated, leading to a more definitive bear market confirmation by June. This outlook aligns with observations from research firm XWIN Research, which noted that Bitcoin has not established a clear bullish trend. They characterized the current crypto market environment as one of high volatility, lacking a definitive bullish or bearish stance.

Additionally, XWIN Research raised concerns about potential recession risks, suggesting that increased deleveraging and ETF outflows could push Bitcoin's price below $80,000, with a drop to $50,000 becoming a plausible scenario.

Another analyst, Ali Martinez, highlighted a recurring death cross pattern on Bitcoin's weekly chart, which has historically led to significant price corrections. This technical indicator, formed by the intersection of the 10-week and 50-week simple moving averages, has preceded substantial declines in previous market cycles. Martinez pointed out that if historical patterns hold, Bitcoin could see a correction of 50% to 60%, potentially dropping to around $38,000.

Martinez also identified the price range between $50,000 and $38,000 as becoming increasingly attractive for long-term spot accumulation, suggesting that investors may find opportunities in this territory as the market evolves.
