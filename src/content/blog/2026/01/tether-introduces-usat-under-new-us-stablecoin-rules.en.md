## Overview

Tether has announced the launch of a new US-regulated stablecoin known as USAt. This stablecoin is issued by Anchorage Digital Bank and is backed by reserves from Cantor Fitzgerald. The introduction of USAt comes in the context of new regulations under the US GENIUS Act, which is designed to provide a framework for stablecoins in the United States.

## What Happened

Tether's new stablecoin, USAt, is significant as it represents a shift towards compliance with US regulatory standards. The stablecoin is issued by Anchorage Digital Bank, a financial institution that operates under the regulations set forth by US authorities. This means that USAt adheres to the guidelines established for stablecoins, which are intended to enhance transparency and trust within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Backing the USAt stablecoin are reserves from Cantor Fitzgerald, a well-known financial services firm. This backing is crucial as it provides a layer of security and assurance to users, indicating that the stablecoin is supported by tangible assets. This move aligns with the broader trend in the crypto market where regulatory compliance and institutional backing are becoming increasingly important for the credibility of digital assets.

The launch of USAt on major exchanges signifies Tether's commitment to expanding its offerings while adhering to the new regulatory landscape. By introducing a compliant stablecoin, Tether is positioning itself strategically within the evolving framework of cryptocurrency regulations in the United States.
