## Overview

Recent analysis by crypto analyst Javon Marks focuses on Dogecoin (DOGE) and its resistance level, which is currently hindering a potential price rally. Marks has been sharing his insights on social media since the previous year, emphasizing the significance of this resistance level in Dogecoin's price trajectory.

## Resistance Level Holds Back Price Rally

Javon Marks has identified a critical resistance level that is currently limiting Dogecoin's upside potential. This resistance level is characterized as a "resisting trend break," which was established following a prolonged downtrend. The importance of this level lies in the fact that Dogecoin's price has not dipped below it, suggesting that the coin's breakout structure remains intact. As long as this resistance level holds, Marks believes that Dogecoin has the potential to achieve a significant price increase.

Marks has specifically pointed out that Dogecoin is currently 402% below the key resistance level of $0.6533. This figure indicates that for Dogecoin to initiate a substantial upward movement, it must first rally to this resistance level. Until that occurs, Marks suggests that any potential gains may be limited or only temporary.

An essential factor contributing to Marks' bullish outlook on Dogecoin is the formation of higher lows on the price chart. This pattern signifies that recent selling pressure and price declines have not been able to push Dogecoin back to its previous lows. As long as this trend continues, Marks believes that a move towards the $0.6533 target is a matter of time.

Moreover, the chart analysis reveals that Dogecoin has confirmed a structural shift by forming multiple higher highs after breaking a long-term descending trendline. This combination of higher highs and higher lows is often indicative of bullish market conditions. However, Marks emphasizes that the price must overcome the $0.6533 resistance to validate any forthcoming bullish movement.

In his previous analyses, Marks has consistently highlighted a potential next target of $1.25111 for Dogecoin, reiterating that the cryptocurrency's price was closer to the $0.6533 resistance than it is currently. This suggests that despite a prolonged correction phase, Marks remains optimistic about Dogecoin's ability to surpass the $1 threshold in the future.

## Signs of Stabilization

In addition to Marks' analysis, another crypto analyst, Bitguru, has noted that Dogecoin may be forming a base after a recent liquidity grab. Bitguru observed that the cryptocurrency has been compressing near its lows and displaying a long consolidation range following a sharp price decline. This pattern often indicates that selling pressure is diminishing and that the market is in a phase of quiet resetting.

With Dogecoin showing signs of stabilization, Bitguru's analysis suggests that once the consolidation phase concludes, the price could potentially surge from $0.11 to $0.20.
