## Overview

The Bitvocation 2025 Bitcoin Jobs Data report reveals a significant uptick in Bitcoin-related job openings, with a total of 1,801 positions available in 2025. This represents a 6% increase from the previous year, indicating a growing demand for talent in the Bitcoin sector. Notably, the majority of these roles are non-technical, reflecting a shift in hiring priorities as companies seek to strengthen their operational frameworks.

## Job Market Dynamics

The report highlights a marked increase in job postings across various sectors within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Non-technical positions, which include roles such as product managers, marketing leads, and executive support, constituted approximately 74% of the total job openings. This trend underscores a strategic move by companies to enhance their day-to-day operations as they expand.

### Geographic Distribution of Job Openings

The United States continues to lead the Bitcoin job market with around 500 listings. However, Singapore has emerged as a notable contender, experiencing an impressive year-over-year increase of nearly 160% in job postings. This surge has elevated Singapore's position in the rankings, showcasing its growing relevance in the Bitcoin employment landscape. Additionally, other smaller markets in Europe and Asia have also recorded significant gains, while Switzerland saw a decline in opportunities, indicating a shift in hiring strategies across different regions.

### Companies and Roles in Demand

Over 150 Bitcoin-focused firms were actively advertising job openings in 2025. Mining companies and payment firms were particularly prominent in their hiring efforts, with director-level positions seeing a substantial rise—approximately tenfold—indicating a need for senior-level management to oversee growth initiatives. Interestingly, the trend towards remote work has diminished, with the percentage of fully remote jobs decreasing from about 53% to 45%. This shift suggests that companies are increasingly favoring roles that require physical presence or hybrid work arrangements.

### Challenges in Recruitment

Despite the surge in job openings, some specialized technical positions remain challenging to fill. Recruiters are finding it difficult to locate developers with extensive knowledge of the Bitcoin protocol and experience with the Lightning Network. Furthermore, companies are seeking candidates who not only possess technical skills but also understand Bitcoin's culture and can effectively collaborate within a team. This combination of skills is relatively rare in the current job market.

### Opportunities for Job Seekers

For job seekers, the evolving market rewards candidates with diverse skill sets. Individuals who can write, manage products, or oversee operations while possessing a basic understanding of Bitcoin are finding increased opportunities. Recruiters are favoring candidates who can adapt to various tasks and manage multiple responsibilities, as many teams remain small even in the face of expanding hiring.

## From author

The findings from the Bitvocation report highlight a transformative phase in the Bitcoin job market, characterized by a diversification of roles and an increasing emphasis on operational functions. As companies adapt to growth and seek to fill key positions, the demand for versatile talent will likely shape the future of hiring in the cryptocurrency sector.
