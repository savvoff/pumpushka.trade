## Overview

Bitcoin is currently experiencing a prolonged struggle as it attempts to regain the $90,000 mark. The cryptocurrency has been in a bearish trend for an extended period, raising concerns about the potential for a deeper correction in the market. Analysts are observing significant indicators that suggest a lack of momentum and structural weakness within Bitcoin's price action.

## Current Market Situation

Bitcoin's recent price movements have highlighted a market characterized by hesitation rather than strong conviction among traders. Following a bearish breakdown below the $90,000 level, Bitcoin's price has slipped into a state of indecision, prompting questions about whether this pullback is merely a temporary shakeout or the beginning of a more profound corrective phase.

Analyst Axel Adler has pointed to a macro indicator known as Trend Pulse to help explain the waning momentum. Since January 19, the market has remained in Bear Mode, with no Bull phase observed for 83 consecutive days. Two separate charts have reinforced this trend, indicating that both short-term momentum and quarterly performance have turned negative simultaneously. The Trend Pulse indicator has shifted from Neutral to Bear, driven by a double-negative setup: the 14-day return has turned negative, and the signal from the 30-day simple moving average (SMA30) compared to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA200) is also negative.

Bitcoin's quarterly return currently sits at -19%, highlighting macroeconomic weakness, although it does not reflect the extreme conditions typically associated with a definitive market bottom. The last Bull Mode signal for Bitcoin was recorded on November 2, 2025, when it was trading near $110,000. Since then, the market has failed to regain its structural strength, with the brief Neutral phase between December 30 and January 18 proving too weak to restore the long-term trend.

Adler notes that the first sign of improvement would occur if the 14-day return reverts back above zero, which would shift the market regime from Bear to Neutral. However, a complete transition back into Bull Mode requires a second condition: the SMA30 must break above the SMA200. Given the current divergence between these two averages, such a crossover would likely necessitate several weeks of sustained upward movement rather than a fleeting bounce.

## From Author

The ongoing struggle of Bitcoin to reclaim the $90,000 level represents a critical moment for the cryptocurrency market. With key indicators pointing toward a lack of momentum, traders and analysts alike are left to ponder the implications of these developments. The sustained period in Bear Mode, coupled with negative performance metrics, suggests that Bitcoin may be at a crossroads, where decisive movement in either direction could have significant ramifications for the broader market.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- Bitcoin's prolonged time in Bear Mode signifies a lack of bullish momentum, which may discourage new investments.
- The negative quarterly return could lead to increased pessimism among traders, potentially affecting overall market sentiment.
- The failure to reclaim and sustain above the $90,000 mark may trigger further selling pressure and contribute to a deeper market pullback.
- The divergence between key moving averages suggests that without a significant shift in momentum, Bitcoin could remain under pressure in the near term.
- Increased sell volume relative to buy volume indicates that bearish sentiment is currently dominating the market, which could deter bullish traders.
