## Overview

XRP has experienced a continuation of its downward trend, falling below key price levels and signaling potential further declines. The cryptocurrency is currently consolidating its losses, with bearish indicators suggesting that it could face additional pressure if it does not break through certain resistance points.

## Recent Price Movement

XRP's price has recently dipped below $1.920, marking a significant decline from earlier levels. The cryptocurrency is now trading below $1.9250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, indicating a bearish sentiment in the market. The price action indicates that XRP has entered a short-term bearish zone after failing to hold above the $2.00 mark. This downturn is in line with the movements of other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have also shown weakness.

The price initially dropped below $1.950 and $1.9350, forming a low near $1.90. Following this drop, there was a brief recovery above $1.9120, where XRP managed to clear the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward move from a swing high to the recent low. However, bearish momentum has remained strong, and XRP continues to trade below the $1.950 level.

Currently, there are two bearish trend lines observed on the hourly chart, with resistance levels identified at $1.95 and $2.00. If XRP can manage a fresh upward move, potential resistance may be encountered near the $1.9450 level, as well as the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the decline from the swing high to the low.

Conversely, if XRP fails to breach the resistance zone around $1.95, a fresh decline may commence. Initial support is located near the $1.90 level, while the next significant support level is around $1.870. Should XRP close below this level, it may continue to decline toward $1.8480, with further support at the $1.820 zone.

### Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for XRP/USD is gaining traction within the bearish zone, suggesting increasing selling pressure.
- **Hourly RSI**: The Relative Strength Index for XRP/USD has fallen below the 50 level, further indicating a bearish trend.
