## Overview

Bitcoin and the stock market have faced significant price volatility and declines since 2025. A crypto analyst has raised alarms regarding the potential for further market correction in 2026, outlining a bearish scenario for Bitcoin amidst continued downward trends in the broader financial landscape.

## Market Analysis

Market analyst Doctor Profit has expressed serious concerns about the current state of both the cryptocurrency and traditional markets, indicating that both Bitcoin and stocks are entrenched in a severe bear market. In a technical analysis shared on X, he pointed out three major bearish setups that are developing simultaneously in Bitcoin.

Doctor Profit highlighted a significant Bearish Divergence on both the weekly and monthly charts. This divergence suggests a disconnect between price movement and momentum indicators, which can indicate that a price drop is imminent. He also identified a bearish flag pattern, which typically signals a potential decline, with a target price of $70,000. Additionally, he mentioned a possible Head and Shoulders pattern that could manifest, further contributing to the bearish outlook.

While acknowledging that Bitcoin might see short-term price increases—potentially rising to the $97,000 to $107,000 range due to strong liquidity—Doctor Profit ultimately believes that the cryptocurrency is more likely to face a decline toward $70,000. He outlined two possible scenarios for this decline: either a breakout from the bearish flag leading to the target price or the completion of the Head and Shoulders pattern before reaching $70,000.

In regard to his trading strategy, Doctor Profit indicated that he would not initiate new short positions at current prices. However, he plans to aggressively increase his short positions if Bitcoin moves into the $97,000 to $107,000 range.

The analyst's bearish perspective extends beyond Bitcoin to the stock market, where he described himself as "ultra-bearish." He noted the stress on banks and the impact of forced liquidations in precious metals like Silver, which are contributing to broader market instability. Furthermore, he observed signs of panic among investors, with record levels of selling activity since August 2025. These factors led him to conclude that the market may be heading toward a crash reminiscent of 2008.

Despite his bearish outlook on Bitcoin and stocks, Doctor Profit remains optimistic about Gold and Silver. He maintains short positions on both Bitcoin and stocks but is bullish on precious metals.

## Upcoming Market Influences

Towards the end of his analysis, Doctor Profit discussed key upcoming events that could impact Bitcoin and the broader financial markets. He mentioned that the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation forecast of 2.7% is set to be released soon. Aside from this, he noted that the remainder of the week is expected to have few significant market-moving events.

Additionally, he flagged January 15 as an important date, as US lawmakers will vote on the CLARITY Act. This legislation could establish clearer rules and oversight for the crypto market if passed.

## From author

The analysis presented by Doctor Profit highlights the precarious state of both the cryptocurrency and stock markets. His observations reflect a growing concern among traders and investors regarding potential market corrections. The mention of specific technical patterns and the macroeconomic context adds depth to the understanding of current market dynamics.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased volatility in Bitcoin could lead to further declines, affecting investor sentiment.
- Bearish technical patterns may discourage new investments in Bitcoin.
- Broader market instability could spill over into the cryptocurrency sector, amplifying price swings.
