## Overview

XRP has experienced a significant surge, moving above the $2.00 mark and entering a consolidation phase. This upward movement has garnered attention from traders, as the price attempts to break through key resistance levels.

## XRP Price Movement

Recently, XRP price initiated a strong increase, surpassing the $2.00 threshold. Following this upward trajectory, the price is now trading above $2.10 and has positioned itself above the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A bullish trend line is forming, with support established at $2.070 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. This technical setup suggests potential for further upward movement if the price can settle above the $2.20 level.

The price increase coincided with a broader positive trend in the cryptocurrency market, as XRP's movement mirrors that of other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price surged past the $2.10 resistance, with bulls driving it even higher, reaching a peak of $2.165. Following this peak, XRP entered a consolidation phase, trading above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the upward move from the $1.983 swing low to the $2.165 high.

As XRP looks to extend its gains, it faces immediate resistance near the $2.1650 level, with the first significant hurdle identified at approximately $2.180. Should the price break through this resistance, there is potential for further upward movement toward the $2.250 and $2.320 resistance levels. The bulls may encounter another major challenge around the $2.350 mark.

Conversely, should XRP fail to overcome the $2.1650 resistance, a decline could ensue. Initial support on the downside is located near the $2.120 level, followed by a more substantial support zone around $2.070, which corresponds to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent upward movement. A break below the $2.070 level could lead to further declines towards the $2.020 mark and potentially down to the $2.00 zone. If the price were to drop below this level, it may continue to decline towards $1.9650.

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for XRP/USD is currently gaining momentum in the bullish zone, indicating a positive trend.
