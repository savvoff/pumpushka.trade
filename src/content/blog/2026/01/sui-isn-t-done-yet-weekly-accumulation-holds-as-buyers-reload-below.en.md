## Overview

SUI has demonstrated resilience on the weekly chart, maintaining its position within a significant accumulation zone despite a recent correction from its highs. Buyers are re-entering at lower levels, indicating a strategy focused on reloading rather than distribution, and suggesting that smart money may be preparing for a potential upward trend.

## Weekly Structure Holds After Deep 2024 Reset

According to a market analysis, SUI is currently holding a high-timeframe accumulation zone on the weekly chart following a significant correction from its highs in 2024. The broader market structure indicates a possible re-accumulation phase, with evidence that participation from smart money is gradually returning after a recent sell-off.

From a technical perspective, several key conditions are aligning favorably for SUI. Liquidity has been swept at the lows, while a strong weekly bullish order block remains intact in the price range between $1.50 and $1.30. Additionally, a Fair Value Gap (FVG) overlapping with this demand zone further supports the case for sustained buyer interest at these levels. The price action has shown a positive response, with a notable bounce from the highlighted entry region.

The rising channel structure that SUI has been following remains unbroken, and the high-timeframe bias is slowly shifting toward a bullish outlook as the price structure stabilizes. Analysts suggest that as long as SUI maintains its position above a specific level, the macro bullish thesis remains valid, acting as a critical line separating continuation from failure. The setup is described as patience-driven, presenting attractive risk-to-reward conditions for both spot and swing traders who are willing to allow the weekly structure to develop.

However, a weekly close below a specified level would invalidate the bullish outlook, while continued defense of that level would reinforce the accumulation narrative. 

## SUI Remains Locked Within Its Established Structure

In a prior analysis, it was noted that SUI remains within its established broader market structure, with price movements respecting the existing range. This behavior indicates that the market has not yet committed to a new direction, leaving both continuation and rejection scenarios on the table. 

The rising base has been tested and defended multiple times, with buyers stepping in aggressively from the lower trendline. Despite this, the upper trendline remains intact and presents a significant resistance point that must be overcome for a confirmed bullish expansion. A decisive break above this upper boundary would signal a stronger conviction, potentially opening the door for sustained upward movement. Conversely, if the price fails to break through this resistance, the movement could be classified merely as a relief bounce, resulting in the market remaining in a consolidation phase with the larger direction still uncertain.

## From Author

The current market conditions for SUI indicate a complex interplay of accumulation and resistance. While there are signs of renewed buyer interest, the price action remains confined within a range that necessitates careful observation. Traders and investors should remain vigilant, as the dynamics could shift significantly based on upcoming price movements.

## Impact on the Crypto Market
