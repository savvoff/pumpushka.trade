## Overview

XRP has experienced a continuation of bearish momentum, trading below key psychological and technical levels. The price action indicates that further declines may be on the horizon if it cannot reclaim the critical resistance level.

## Current Price Action

XRP price has extended its losses, trading below the $1.880 mark. Following a fresh decline that started below the $1.90 zone, the price is currently consolidating, showing signs of potential further decline if it remains under the $1.920 threshold. The price action indicates a bearish sentiment, as XRP has failed to maintain levels above $1.950, similar to trends observed in other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The price has dropped below the $1.920 and $1.90 levels, entering a short-term bearish zone. In this phase, XRP even dipped below $1.850, forming a low at $1.810 before attempting to recover. Despite a brief recovery above $1.850, XRP remains below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, which is typically a key indicator for short-term price trends.

A key bearish trend line is forming with resistance identified at $1.885 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. If XRP price makes an upward move, it may encounter resistance near the $1.8850 level as well as the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent downward move. The first significant resistance level is at $1.90, and a close above this level could potentially lead the price back towards $1.950. Further resistance levels are identified at $2.00 and $2.050, with a more substantial hurdle near $2.20.

## Potential Downside Risks

Should XRP fail to break through the $1.90 resistance zone, it may initiate a fresh decline. Initial support is positioned near the $1.840 level, followed by a more significant support level at $1.820. A downside break and a close below the $1.820 mark could lead to further declines toward $1.780, with additional support found around the $1.750 zone. If the price were to drop below this, it could continue downward towards $1.70.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for XRP/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone, indicating a strengthening downtrend.
- **Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: The RSI for XRP/USD is currently near the 50 level, suggesting a neutral stance but with potential for further bearish movement.

## From author

The current price action of XRP highlights ongoing bearish pressure, with significant technical levels influencing the market's direction. The failure to maintain higher levels signals a cautious outlook for traders and investors. Monitoring the resistance and support levels will be crucial for understanding potential future movements in the XRP market.

## Impact on the crypto market

- XRP's decline reflects broader market trends seen in other major cryptocurrencies, suggesting a potential bearish sentiment across the crypto space.
- The inability to reclaim key resistance levels may lead to increased selling pressure and further declines in price.
- Continued bearish momentum could impact trader sentiment, leading to more cautious trading strategies.
- The technical indicators suggest that the market remains in a delicate balance, with potential for both upward recovery or further decline depending on upcoming price action.
- The overall market's reaction to XRP's price movement could influence investor behavior in other altcoins and major cryptocurrencies.
