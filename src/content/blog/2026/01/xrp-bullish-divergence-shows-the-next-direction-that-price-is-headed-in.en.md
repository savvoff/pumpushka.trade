## Overview

Recent analysis of XRP indicates that despite current price corrections, the cryptocurrency is positioned for potential upward movement. Technical analysis suggests that these corrections may be part of a larger, strategically planned setup that could influence XRP's future price trajectory.

## Current Price Action and Analysis

XRP is currently experiencing price corrections, but technical indicators suggest an overall upward trend. A recent analysis shared on X by a crypto analyst highlights this pullback as a calculated reset. The analyst argues that the current correction is part of a broader setup that could define XRP's next significant move. According to this analysis, the lower XRP's price falls, the more pronounced the potential breakout could be.

The analysis outlines a falling wedge pattern that XRP's price action has followed, dating back to early 2025. This pattern is known for typically resolving to the upside. In July 2025, XRP successfully broke above the falling wedge, reaching the analyst's projected target. This breakout led to a corrective phase where XRP transitioned into a descending broadening wedge. This new structure is characterized by lower lows and lower highs, indicating a gradual decline in price since mid-2025.

The recent correction of approximately 23% aligns with the analyst's predictions, reinforcing the notion that XRP’s current price action is part of a pre-planned trajectory. The analyst emphasizes that the lower the price goes, the higher the subsequent breakout is expected to be.

## Future Projections for XRP Price

The descending broadening wedge on the three-day chart provides a clear measured projection for where this corrective phase may conclude. There is a possibility that XRP's price might decline to a specific region before rebounding, with the lower trendline of the descending wedge acting as a potential support level. Observations indicate that if the price reaches this projected area and selling pressure diminishes, XRP could experience a sharp reversal. This scenario is reminiscent of XRP's previous reaction following the completion of the falling wedge in July 2025.

However, the analysis also notes that XRP's price does not necessarily have to fall to the projected low before rebounding. An eventual break above the upper trendline of the descending wedge is anticipated to propel XRP to new price highs. The analyst highlights the importance of closing above a specific price level to confirm this breakout.

Additionally, on-chain data from Glassnode indicates a trend where XRP is reverting to a cost-basis setup similar to conditions observed in February 2022. This trend may influence selling pressure in the near term.
