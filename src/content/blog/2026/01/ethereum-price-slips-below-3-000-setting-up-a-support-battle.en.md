## Overview

Ethereum has experienced a notable price fluctuation as it struggled to maintain momentum above the $3,000 mark. After an attempt to recover from a lower range, the cryptocurrency is now facing challenges, indicating a potential battle for support levels.

## Recent Price Movements

Ethereum's price initially showed signs of recovery, rising above the $2,880 zone. This upward movement allowed it to surpass the $2,920 and $2,950 resistance levels. However, the recovery was short-lived, as the price failed to hold above $3,000 and subsequently began to decline. The highest point reached during this brief surge was around $3,040 before the bears took control, leading to a fresh decline.

A significant factor in this downturn was the break below a bullish trend line that had previously provided support at the $3,000 level. As the price fell, it moved below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent upward movement from a swing low of $2,784 to the high of $3,040. Currently, Ethereum is trading below $2,990 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, indicating a shift in market sentiment.

If Ethereum can maintain its position above the $2,880 support zone, there is potential for another attempt at increasing its price. Immediate resistance is identified near the $2,980 level, with the primary resistance at $3,000. Should the price clear this resistance, it might pave the way for further gains, potentially leading towards the $3,120 resistance level.

Conversely, if Ethereum fails to break through the $3,000 resistance, it is likely to face further declines. Initial support is near the $2,920 level, with major support positioned at the $2,880 zone, which also corresponds to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent price action. A significant move below $2,880 could lead to further declines towards the $2,820 support and potentially the $2,780 region, with $2,740 identified as the main support level.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone, suggesting a potential continuation of the downward trend.
- **Hourly RSI**: The RSI for ETH/USD is currently below the 50 mark, indicating bearish momentum.

## From author

The recent fluctuations in Ethereum's price reflect the ongoing volatility in the cryptocurrency market. The struggle to maintain support levels above $2,880 and the failure to hold above $3,000 could have implications for market sentiment and trading strategies.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Ethereum's inability to sustain its price above key resistance levels may signal bearish sentiment among traders.
- A decline below the $2,880 support could lead to increased selling pressure and further losses.
