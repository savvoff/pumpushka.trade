## Overview

XRP is currently facing significant challenges as it attempts to reclaim the $2 mark following a sharp decline that briefly brought its price down to the $1.85 level. Amid rising macroeconomic uncertainty, the broader cryptocurrency market is under pressure, with analysts suggesting that it may be entering a deeper bear market phase. This environment has led to increased volatility, particularly in the derivatives market for XRP.

## Recent Developments

On January 18, XRP experienced a notable spike in forced liquidations, particularly impacting long positions across major exchanges. Data from the XRP Exchange Liquidation Metrics indicates that over $5 million in long positions were liquidated on that day. This event is significant as it reflects a broader trend of traders being positioned too aggressively in anticipation of a market rebound, only to be caught off guard by sudden market movements. 

Binance was a major player in this liquidation wave, accounting for approximately $1.05 million of the total long liquidations. This highlights Binance’s influential role in driving short-term volatility in the XRP market. The forced liquidations occurred in a context where macroeconomic factors were exerting pressure on the entire cryptocurrency market, rather than being solely a technical issue within XRP itself.

According to the CryptoQuant report, the liquidation spike was part of a larger risk-off sentiment across global markets, triggered by geopolitical tensions and trade-war rhetoric. Reports indicated that European nations might consider imposing tariffs in response to U.S. pressures, which could lead to heightened market volatility and fears of slower economic growth. Such developments typically cause traders to reassess their exposure to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

As the sentiment turned negative, Bitcoin’s price drop from above $95,000 to below $93,000 further exacerbated the situation, leading to increased selling pressure on altcoins like XRP. This resulted in leveraged long positions being liquidated in a falling market, rather than traders choosing to exit voluntarily.

## Market Dynamics for XRP

Following the sharp sell-off, XRP is struggling to maintain its position below the psychological $2 level. After a brief attempt to rebound to around $2.40, the price was met with strong selling pressure, leading to a decline back into the $1.85–$2.00 zone. Currently, XRP is trading around $1.97, indicating that it is still under significant pressure from sellers.

The daily chart reveals that XRP is trading below major moving averages, with the faster average acting as dynamic resistance. The market structure shows a trend of lower highs since the peak in October, suggesting that rallies are being sold rather than sustained. Buyers are attempting to establish a demand floor near $1.85, but continued pressure may lead to further breakdowns if the price fails to reclaim higher levels.

## From author

The situation surrounding XRP highlights the intricate relationship between macroeconomic factors and cryptocurrency market dynamics. As geopolitical tensions create uncertainty, traders are forced to react swiftly, leading to forced liquidations and heightened volatility. The behavior of leveraged positions in this context serves as a reminder of the risks associated with trading in highly volatile environments.
