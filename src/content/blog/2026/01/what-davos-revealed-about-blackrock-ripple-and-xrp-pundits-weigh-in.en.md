## Overview

Recent discussions among XRP commentators at Davos have sparked speculation regarding the potential alignment between BlackRock and Ripple concerning tokenized finance. While no official partnership has been confirmed, the conversations highlight the growing interest and involvement of major financial institutions in the cryptocurrency space.

## The Davos Discussion

During a panel at Davos, various commentators focused on the presence of BlackRock and Ripple, suggesting a shared vision for the future of finance. Host Versan Aljarrah initiated the conversation by referencing BlackRock and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse's attendance. Guest Jake Claver mentioned insights from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who discussed the idea of consolidating settlements onto a single blockchain. Claver expressed confidence in Ripple's position, asserting that their long-standing presence in discussions surrounding blockchain technology indicates a significant role for the XRP Ledger (XRPL).

Aljarrah expanded on the implications of this engagement, stating that it appears evident that BlackRock, JP Morgan, Ripple, and other major banks have connections to Ripple and XRP. He emphasized that access to events like Davos serves as an important filter for understanding institutional dynamics and that Garlinghouse's involvement carries weight beyond mere publicity.

The panel also explored Ripple's strategic positioning within the financial landscape, emphasizing how acquisitions and partnerships, including custody arrangements with firms like Palisade, Metaco, and Standard Custody, have bolstered Ripple's influence. The discussion underscored BlackRock's role as a pivotal player in Ripple's institutional strategy, suggesting that its entry into the market could trigger significant liquidity events for XRP.

Edo Farina noted that a large institutional order from BlackRock could create a notable market impact, suggesting that current pricing could remain subdued if institutional transactions occur through over-the-counter (OTC) arrangements. Claver added that such an entry might lead to a supply shock for XRP, allowing it to decouple from broader market trends, including those of Bitcoin.

Despite this optimism, it's essential to acknowledge that BlackRock's current investments predominantly focus on Ethereum and Bitcoin. Its flagship U.S. products track these cryptocurrencies, and its tokenization initiatives have primarily been Ethereum-based. BlackRock's thematic outlook for 2026 explicitly positions Ethereum as a key infrastructure layer for tokenization, indicating that institutional preferences often lean towards Ethereum as the leading blockchain for tokenized assets.

## From author

The discussions at Davos reveal a complex interplay between major financial institutions and the cryptocurrency market. While the potential for collaboration between BlackRock and Ripple is intriguing, the lack of concrete partnerships highlights the speculative nature of these conversations. The focus on XRP's future liquidity events suggests that market participants are keenly aware of the evolving dynamics within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased interest from major financial institutions could signal a shift in the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies within traditional finance.
