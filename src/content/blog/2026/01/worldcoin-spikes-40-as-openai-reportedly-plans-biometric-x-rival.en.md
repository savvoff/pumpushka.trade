## Overview

Worldcoin has experienced a significant surge, reportedly rising 40% in value. This spike is linked to news that OpenAI is developing a rival platform that may utilize biometric technology for identity verification and integrate ChatGPT to facilitate content creation.

## What Happened

Recent reports indicate that a small team is working on a new platform that could compete with Worldcoin. This initiative by OpenAI is noteworthy as it suggests an increasing interest in biometrics for verifying individual identity online. The proposed platform would potentially use biometric data as a means of proving a person's identity, which aligns with Worldcoin’s mission of establishing proof-of-personhood.

The integration of ChatGPT into this new platform may also play a crucial role. By leveraging advanced AI capabilities, the platform could enhance user interactions and content generation, making the service more appealing to users. The combination of biometric verification and AI-driven content creation could represent a significant advancement in how digital identities are managed and utilized across various online applications.
