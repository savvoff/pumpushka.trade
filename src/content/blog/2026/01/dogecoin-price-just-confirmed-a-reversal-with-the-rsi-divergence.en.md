## Overview

Dogecoin's price action on the daily timeframe is displaying early indications of a potential reversal after a prolonged downtrend. Following months of declining prices, technical analysis suggests that Dogecoin may be forming a critical turning point characterized by a double-bottom structure and an RSI divergence.

## Technical Analysis of Dogecoin

### Signs of Weakening Downtrend

Dogecoin has experienced an extended period of declining price movement, with its price hovering around long-term support close to $0.12. Recent technical analysis highlights a significant development: the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has not made a new low even as Dogecoin's price revisits the same support level. Instead, the RSI has formed a higher low, indicating a bullish divergence between the price and momentum. This divergence suggests that selling pressure is diminishing, which is a critical factor as it has historically preceded relief rallies for Dogecoin when combined with robust structural support.

### Double-Bottom Structure

In addition to the RSI divergence, Dogecoin's price is also displaying a double-bottom formation along the lower boundary of a descending channel. This structural setup indicates a potential exhaustion of selling activity, which may signal an upcoming reversal. The longer Dogecoin maintains its position above this support base, the more compelling the argument for accumulation becomes. 

For a confirmed reversal, Dogecoin will need to reclaim and sustain a price above $0.16. Achieving this level would validate the bullish RSI divergence and the double-bottom structure. However, a more significant rally is anticipated only if Dogecoin can break through the $0.31 resistance level.

### Historical Context and Fractal Analysis

Further analysis of Dogecoin's higher-timeframe charts reveals a fractal pattern that mirrors previous price movements. Notably, this fractal appears similar to one observed before a significant breakout in late 2024, where Dogecoin experienced a 331% increase. In that instance, the memecoin underwent a prolonged period of decline, developed a rounded basing structure, and subsequently launched into a steep ascent after a shift in momentum.

Currently, Dogecoin's price action exhibits a comparable rounded recovery attempt, followed by a controlled pullback to long-term support. As of the latest data, Dogecoin is trading at approximately $0.1221, positioned at the base of a potential vertical move if the fractal pattern continues to unfold as anticipated.

## From author

The developments in Dogecoin's price action are noteworthy for traders and investors alike. The combination of a bullish RSI divergence and a double-bottom structure could signify a shift in market sentiment towards the memecoin. However, the necessity for confirmation at key resistance levels cannot be overstated, as the crypto market remains inherently volatile.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Dogecoin's potential reversal may attract renewed interest from traders looking for entry points.
- A successful move above $0.16 could signal a broader trend reversal, influencing market sentiment for other cryptocurrencies.
- The historical fractal pattern may lead to increased speculation and trading activity as traders anticipate a possible breakout.
- If Dogecoin's price continues to hold above long-term support, it could trigger accumulation strategies among investors.
- The overall market dynamics may shift if Dogecoin successfully transitions from its corrective phase, potentially affecting altcoin performance.
