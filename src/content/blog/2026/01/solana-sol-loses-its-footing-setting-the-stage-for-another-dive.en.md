## Overview

Solana has experienced a significant price decline after failing to maintain stability above $145. Currently, the asset is consolidating losses below $135, indicating potential for further downward movement. This situation is critical as it reflects broader trends in the cryptocurrency market.

## Recent Price Movements

The price of Solana began to fall sharply after it was unable to remain above $142. This decline was mirrored by similar movements in other major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana's price dropped below key support levels at $140 and $138, gaining bearish momentum as it fell beneath $135. A low was established at $130, where the price is now consolidating losses.

Despite a brief recovery that allowed Solana to surpass the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of its recent downward movement, the asset is still trading below $135 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance is noted around the $135 level, while the next significant resistance is near $136, which corresponds to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent high of $143 to the low of $130. 

Additionally, a key bearish trend line is forming, with resistance at $140 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. If Solana manages to close above this resistance zone, it could pave the way for a recovery, potentially leading to further gains towards the $150 level. 

## Future Outlook

If Solana fails to break above the $136 resistance, the asset may continue its downward trajectory. Initial support can be found near the $132 level, and the first major support is located around $130. A breach of the $130 level could signal a move towards the $122 support zone. Should the price close below this support, it might further decline toward the $115 level in the near future.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone, indicating a prevailing negative sentiment.
- **Hourly RSI**: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for SOL/USD is currently below the 50 level, suggesting weakness in the market.
- **Major Support Levels**: Key support levels are identified at $132 and $130.
