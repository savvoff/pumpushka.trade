## Overview

Ripple is transitioning the role of XRP from being primarily a traded asset to serving as infrastructure for tokenized finance and institutional settlement. This shift was articulated by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse during the World Economic Forum 2026, where he highlighted the ongoing developments in tokenization, bank integration, and on-chain settlement.

## XRP’s Evolving Role in Finance

At the World Economic Forum, Garlinghouse emphasized that XRP’s evolution is centered around tokenization, which has progressed from theoretical concepts to practical applications within financial institutions. He noted that tokenized asset volume on the XRP Ledger has experienced substantial growth, indicating a strong commitment from institutions. This growth signals that banks, custodians, and regulated entities are actively involved in the tokenization process, moving real value rather than merely exploring potential applications.

Garlinghouse explained that institutions are now focused on integrating tokenized assets into their existing financial frameworks, which include balance sheets and liquidity structures. This integration requires a robust infrastructure capable of processing large volumes of transactions consistently, ensuring deterministic settlement, and operating continuously. The XRP Ledger is positioned to meet these demands, emphasizing reliability and execution under real financial constraints.

As tokenized assets become integral to core financial operations, the infrastructure supporting them transitions from being optional to foundational. XRP is increasingly viewed not as a standalone asset but as a crucial component of the machinery that enables tokenized finance to function effectively.

## Addressing Compliance and Liquidity Challenges

Garlinghouse also discussed the challenges that arise when tokenization intersects with decentralized finance (DeFi). Institutions seek access to programmability and liquidity but must adhere to compliance, custody, and trust requirements. This presents a central problem that Ripple is actively working to resolve.

Ripple is collaborating with global banks to create regulated pathways that connect tokenized assets with on-chain liquidity. The goal is to facilitate interactions between institutions and decentralized systems while remaining within regulatory frameworks. In this context, XRP functions as a settlement and connectivity layer, enabling seamless movement between traditional financial systems and decentralized environments.

This approach reframes the utility of XRP. Its value now lies in its ability to provide finality, access to liquidity, and interoperability across both regulated and on-chain settings. As the convergence of tokenized assets, decentralized rails, and institutional settlement continues, the demand for networks that can deliver finality at scale grows increasingly important. Garlinghouse asserted that the XRP Ledger is already equipped to provide this capability, giving it a structural advantage in the evolving financial landscape.

## From author

This strategic pivot by Ripple highlights the growing importance of infrastructure in the financial ecosystem, particularly as the lines between traditional finance and decentralized systems blur. The emphasis on compliance and reliability suggests that the future of finance may increasingly rely on established networks that can support both innovation and regulatory adherence. 

## Impact on the crypto market

- Ripple is positioning XRP as a foundational element of tokenized finance rather than just a tradeable asset.
- The growth in tokenized asset volume suggests increased institutional engagement with cryptocurrency.
- XRP's role as a settlement layer could enhance its adoption among financial institutions.
- The focus on regulatory compliance may attract traditional financial entities to engage with blockchain technology.
- The development of pathways between tokenized assets and on-chain liquidity could lead to more robust financial systems.
- Overall, this transition may reshape how cryptocurrencies are perceived and utilized within the broader financial landscape.
