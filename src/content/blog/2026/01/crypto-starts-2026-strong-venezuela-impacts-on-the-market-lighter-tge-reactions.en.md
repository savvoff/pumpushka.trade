## Overview

The global crypto market has seen a significant uptick, with the market cap increasing by 2% to $3.22 trillion. Major cryptocurrencies are on the rise, reflecting a positive trend in the market. Amidst this growth, several key developments from financial institutions and regulatory bodies are shaping the landscape, highlighting the increasing integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional finance.

## Market Developments

The recent surge in the global crypto market cap to $3.22 trillion is driven by notable price increases among major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has risen by 1%, reaching $93,780, while Ethereum has seen a 2% increase to $3,240. Solana has gained 3%, now valued at $139, and XRP has experienced a substantial 12% rise, reaching $2.37. Other notable movers include RENDER, SUI, and LIT, each showing impressive gains.

In a significant move, Bank of America has officially launched its crypto recommendations for wealth clients, allowing for a portfolio allocation of up to 4% in cryptocurrencies. This initiative reflects a growing acceptance of digital assets within traditional financial services. Additionally, Morgan Stanley has taken steps to further engage with the crypto market by filing for a Solana Trust with the SEC, indicating interest in offering more structured investment products related to cryptocurrencies.

Goldman Sachs has also made headlines by upgrading Coinbase to a 'Buy' rating, while simultaneously downgrading eToro. This shift in ratings suggests a reassessment of major players in the crypto exchange space, potentially influencing investor perceptions and decisions.

On the regulatory front, Japan's finance minister has expressed support for deeper integration of cryptocurrencies, advocating for lower taxes and reforms at the exchange level. This endorsement is expected to foster a more favorable environment for crypto adoption and innovation within Japan.

Prominent figures in the crypto community are also making waves. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has asserted that the platform has effectively addressed the "Blockchain Trilemma," achieving a balance between decentralization and scalability through its Layer-2 roadmap. This claim may bolster confidence in Ethereum's future as a scalable blockchain solution.

However, not all news is positive. Kraken is currently investigating reports suggesting that customer data may be available for sale on the dark web, following a potential security exploit. Meanwhile, Ledger users are on high alert due to a data breach involving its e-commerce partner, Global-E, which has exposed customer contact details. These security concerns highlight ongoing vulnerabilities in the crypto sector.
