## Overview

VanEck, a prominent asset management firm and cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer, has released a research study indicating that Bitcoin could reach a price of $2.9 million by the year 2050. This projection is based on a valuation framework that considers Bitcoin's function as both a medium of exchange and a reserve asset for central banks.

## Details of the Research

Matthew Sigel, the Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, along with Senior Investment Analyst Patrick Bush, conducted the analysis. They project a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% for Bitcoin from its current levels, suggesting that the cryptocurrency will play a significant role in the global economy over the coming decades.

The report identifies two critical shifts that could drive Bitcoin's appreciation:

### Settlement Pivot

The first shift, referred to as the Settlement Pivot, posits that by 2050, Bitcoin could facilitate the settlement of 5% to 10% of global international trade and 5% of domestic trade transactions. This indicates a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a viable means for conducting trade on a large scale.

### Reserve Pivot

The second shift, termed the Reserve Pivot, connects Bitcoin's potential growth with decreasing trust in G7 sovereign debt. As confidence in these traditional currencies wanes, central banks may begin to allocate resources towards Bitcoin as a safeguard against fiscal instability. This pivot suggests that Bitcoin could be viewed as a more stable asset in uncertain economic times.

The report also explores a more optimistic scenario, known as the Bull Case, which envisions what the authors term “hyper-bitcoinization.” In this scenario, if Bitcoin captures 20% of international trade and 10% of domestic GDP, its price could soar to $53.4 million per coin, reflecting a substantial 29% CAGR. This scenario would require Bitcoin to rival or surpass gold’s status as a primary global reserve asset, constituting nearly 30% of financial assets worldwide.

For context, the report uses a baseline current price of around $88,000 for Bitcoin when projecting these potential values. It also includes a Bear Case target of $130,000, which reflects a modest 2% CAGR.

In terms of market behavior, VanEck anticipates that Bitcoin will show low to moderate correlation with global equities, bonds, and gold across various market cycles. Notably, the study emphasizes a persistent negative correlation with the US Dollar, reinforcing the notion that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against monetary debasement.

## From author

The ambitious projections from VanEck highlight the evolving role of Bitcoin within the global financial system. The research underscores the potential for Bitcoin to transition from a speculative asset to a fundamental component of international trade and reserve management. The implications of such shifts could redefine how both institutional and retail investors view cryptocurrencies in the context of their broader investment strategies.

## Impact on the crypto market

- A significant long-term price target for Bitcoin could attract increased institutional interest and investment.
- The identification of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and reserve asset may enhance its legitimacy and adoption in traditional finance.
- Increased acceptance of Bitcoin in international trade could lead to broader market participation and liquidity.
- The potential for Bitcoin to serve as a hedge against fiscal instability may drive demand during economic downturns.
- The correlation dynamics with traditional assets could influence portfolio diversification strategies among investors.
