## Overview

Solana (SOL) has experienced a significant decline, failing to maintain its position above $125. Currently, the price is consolidating losses below $120 and facing challenges in initiating a recovery. This price movement is critical as it approaches key support levels that could dictate its future trajectory.

## Recent Price Movement

After failing to establish stability above the $125 mark, Solana's price has taken a downward turn, mirroring broader market trends observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The SOL price dropped below both the $125 and $122 support levels, gaining bearish momentum as it fell below the $120 threshold. This decline has led to a low being established at $112, where the price is currently consolidating losses.

The price has made a slight recovery, climbing towards the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, which corresponds to the downward movement from the recent swing high of $128 to the established low of $112. Despite this brief recovery, Solana is still trading below the $120 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average, indicating a bearish trend.

On the hourly chart for the SOL/USD pair, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $116. This level, along with the next major resistance near $120, poses significant barriers for any potential recovery. The $122 resistance level is particularly crucial; a successful close above this zone could pave the way for a more sustained increase in price.

## Potential for Further Decline

If Solana fails to break above the $116 resistance, it may continue its downward movement. The initial support level is positioned around $114, but the primary support level to monitor is at $112. A breach of this support level could see the price drop further toward the $105 zone. Should the price close below $105, it might lead to a decline towards the $102 support level in the near term.

## Technical Indicators
