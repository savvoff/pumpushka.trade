## Overview

SUI is demonstrating early signs of a significant shift in momentum after successfully reclaiming a crucial accumulation zone identified by smart money on the weekly chart. Following a substantial corrective phase, the price structure is showing signs of stabilization, which suggests that patient investors may be positioning themselves for a forthcoming major move in the market.

## Price Structure and Market Dynamics

After experiencing a deep correction from its highs in 2024, SUI has managed to maintain its position within a high-timeframe accumulation zone on the weekly chart. This was highlighted by crypto analyst Crypto Patel, who noted that the broader market structure appears to be entering a re-accumulation phase characterized by the involvement of smart money.

Several technical indicators are supporting this analysis. A liquidity sweep at the lows has been successfully completed, and a significant bullish order block situated between specific price levels has been fully filled. Additionally, a fair value gap has aligned with a demand zone, which has contributed to a notable bounce in price. This bounce is indicative of increasing bullish responsiveness, as SUI has shown a recovery of approximately 45% from the identified demand region.

The price action is adhering to a rising channel, suggesting that the structural integrity remains intact. The gradual shift of the high-timeframe bias back towards an upward trajectory indicates that the corrective phase may be nearing its conclusion. If these conditions persist, a more sustained recovery is conceivable.

Looking forward, Crypto Patel has outlined potential upside targets, contingent upon maintaining the broader bullish structure. The macro bullish thesis is considered valid as long as the price remains above a specified support level. The analyst also pointed out that the optimal entry zone, which had been previously shared, has already played out successfully, yielding close to 50% gains on a short-term swing.

## Price Action and Community Sentiment

The Sui Community has emphasized that the recent price movements are not random; rather, they are in alignment with a clearly defined structural framework. Following the completion of a high-timeframe correction, SUI has entered a re-accumulation phase, with prices stabilizing within a well-defined weekly demand zone. This zone has become a focal point for smart money participation, indicating a renewed confidence in the asset following the recent corrective downturn.

The community has echoed the previously mentioned entry zones, which have been validated and have contributed to substantial gains. Given the current market conditions, traders are adopting a patience-driven approach, recognizing the asymmetric risk-to-reward profile that the weekly setup presents. As long as the broader structure remains intact, long-term upside targets continue to be a point of focus.

## From author

The developments surrounding SUI's price action highlight a critical moment within the cryptocurrency market. The transition from a corrective phase to one of potential re-accumulation suggests that investors are becoming increasingly optimistic. The adherence to structural frameworks and the participation of smart money could indicate a shift in market sentiment, which is essential for long-term bullish trends.
