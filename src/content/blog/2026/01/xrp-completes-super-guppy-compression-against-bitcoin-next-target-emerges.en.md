## Overview

A recent technical analysis by market expert Egrag Crypto has revealed that XRP has formed a “Super Guppy Compression” against Bitcoin. This development suggests a potential structural shift in the XRP/BTC trading pair and indicates the possibility of a bullish breakout in the coming months.

## XRP/BTC Forms Super Guppy Compression

Egrag Crypto shared insights on the XRP/BTC price structure and emerging patterns within its chart. According to the analysis, this trading pair has recently entered a transition phase after enduring a multi-year decline. The price action has shown signs of tightening, indicative of a period of compression in the market.

Egrag Crypto highlighted that XRP/BTC has completed a Super Guppy Compression pattern, characterized by full ribbon compression across both short- and long-term Moving Averages (MAs). This compression signifies an upcoming expansion in volatility, suggests that selling pressure has been exhausted, and marks a clear transition phase in the market.

The color dynamics within the Guppy system on the chart indicate a shift in market behavior. Egrag Crypto pointed out that the short-term Moving Averages, referred to as “ribbons,” are turning green, which signals early bullish momentum. In contrast, the long-term ribbons remain red but are beginning to flatten, suggesting that the downward trend for XRP/BTC is easing. While these developments imply that the market has moved out of its bearish phase, a clear uptrend has yet to materialize, placing the trading pair in a base-building stage.

From a price-structure perspective, Egrag Crypto noted that XRP/BTC is forming a bullish rectangular pattern. The analysis revealed that the trading pair has repeatedly bounced off support levels while facing rejection at resistance, indicating that supply is being absorbed rather than aggressively sold off. This behavior aligns with textbook reaccumulation patterns following extended downtrends, signaling a potential upward movement in the future.

## Analyst Sets Targets for XRP/BTC

In his continued analysis, Egrag Crypto provided predictions regarding the future price movements of XRP/BTC. He suggested that over the next few months, there is a significant probability of a bullish breakout. However, he also acknowledged the possibility of extended consolidation should the market structure break—a scenario he deems unlikely.

Egrag Crypto identified key targets for XRP/BTC based on its current market structure. He noted that the structure is more critical than the underlying emotions, emphasizing that despite a seemingly quiet market, positioning is actively occurring for a decisive move. The analyst outlined two upside targets and one downside scenario for XRP/BTC. If the trading pair crosses a certain resistance line, an initial surge to a conservative target followed by a rise to a normal target could occur. Conversely, a structural break could lead to a significant decline in the price.
