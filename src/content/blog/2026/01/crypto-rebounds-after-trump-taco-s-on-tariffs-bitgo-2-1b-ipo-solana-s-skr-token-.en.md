## Overview

The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a notable rebound, driven by recent developments in global trade policy and significant announcements from industry players. Major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have recorded gains, reflecting renewed investor confidence following President Trump's comments on tariffs. Additionally, BitGo's announcement regarding its upcoming IPO adds a layer of optimism to the market landscape.

## Market Rebound Following Tariff Changes

The cryptocurrency market is seeing a resurgence, with Bitcoin increasing by 2% and trading at approximately $89,900. Ethereum also saw a 2% rise, landing at around $2,995, while Solana and XRP followed suit, each recording gains of 2% and 3%, respectively. The market's upward momentum is largely attributed to President Trump's recent pivot regarding tariffs on the European Union, which has alleviated some trade-related uncertainties. This shift has led to over $1 billion in liquidations, particularly as Bitcoin rebounded sharply in response to the news.

In addition to the market rebound, Vitalik Buterin has proposed a new initiative aimed at enhancing Ethereum's security and decentralization through native DVT (Distributed Validator Technology) staking. This proposal indicates ongoing experimentation at the protocol level, which could have significant implications for Ethereum's future development and security.

## BitGo's IPO Announcement

In a significant development, BitGo has announced its initial public offering (IPO) at a share price of $18, valuing the company at approximately $2 billion. This move is expected to attract further attention to the cryptocurrency sector, as BitGo is known for its institutional-grade custody solutions. The IPO could pave the way for increased institutional investment and further legitimization of the crypto market.

## Regulatory Developments

The Senate Agriculture Committee has confirmed that its version of the Clarity Act will proceed to markup next week, despite facing challenges related to bipartisan support. This legislation aims to provide clearer guidelines for cryptocurrency regulation, which could enhance market stability and investor confidence.

In a separate regulatory development, Hong Kong regulators are preparing to issue licenses for stablecoin operations under a new compliance framework. This framework will impose strict operational, reserve, and compliance requirements, potentially leading to a more regulated environment for stablecoin issuers.

Moreover, Russian courts have ruled that cryptocurrencies qualify as property under the law, establishing a legal precedent that could influence future criminal and civil cases involving digital assets. This ruling may encourage greater adoption and recognition of cryptocurrencies within legal frameworks.

## Additional Industry Movements

In a noteworthy initiative, mortgage lender Newrez is exploring the possibility of allowing Bitcoin and Ethereum to count toward mortgage qualifications. This would involve applying discounted valuations to account for the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies, indicating a growing acceptance of digital assets in traditional finance.

Saga's EVM blockchain recently halted operations following a significant hack that resulted in a theft of $7 million, with the stolen funds bridged to Ethereum. This incident highlights the ongoing security challenges faced by blockchain projects.

In a more positive light, Steak ’n Shake has launched a Bitcoin bonus program for its hourly employees, enabling workers to receive a portion of their compensation in Bitcoin. This initiative reflects a broader trend of integrating cryptocurrencies into everyday financial transactions.
