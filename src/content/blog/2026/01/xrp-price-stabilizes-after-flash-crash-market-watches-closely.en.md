## Overview

XRP has experienced a notable decline, trading below the $2.00 mark after a significant drop. The price is currently consolidating, with the potential for further losses if it does not regain key resistance levels.

## Recent Price Movements

XRP's price trajectory has taken a downturn as it extended its losses, falling below the $2.00 threshold. This decline marks a fresh bearish trend for the cryptocurrency, which has struggled to maintain its position above $2.10. The recent price action mirrors a broader market trend, where notable cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have also exhibited declines.

The XRP price broke below a contracting triangle formation with a support level at $2.050. Following this break, it plunged to a low of $1.847 before showing signs of a temporary recovery above $1.920. Despite this bounce, XRP remains below the critical $2.00 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, which suggests a bearish sentiment persists in the market.

As the price attempts to stabilize, it is facing significant resistance near the $1.980 level and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the previous swing high of $2.065 down to the low of $1.847. For XRP to regain upward momentum, it must clear the $2.00 resistance. A close above this mark could potentially lead to a rise toward the $2.065 level, with subsequent hurdles at $2.10 and $2.120.

Conversely, if XRP fails to breach the $2.00 resistance, it may face further declines. Initial support levels are observed near $1.9320 and $1.90. A downward break and close below $1.90 could trigger a more significant decline toward the $1.850 mark, with further support located at $1.820.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for XRP/USD is currently losing momentum within the bearish zone, indicating a potential continuation of the downward trend.
- **Hourly RSI**: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for XRP/USD is positioned below the 50 level, reinforcing the bearish outlook.
- **Major Support Levels**: Current support levels are identified at $1.920 and $1.90.
- **Major Resistance Levels**: Resistance levels are noted at $1.980 and $2.00.

## From author

The recent price movements of XRP highlight the volatility that can occur in the cryptocurrency market. The inability to maintain critical support levels suggests that traders and investors should remain vigilant. The interplay between support and resistance levels will be crucial in determining XRP's near-term direction.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The inability to reclaim the $2.00 threshold may lead to increased selling pressure.
- Market participants are likely to monitor key support levels closely for signals of further declines.
- Resistance levels will be critical in assessing potential recovery opportunities for XRP.
- The technical indicators suggest that bearish sentiment may linger in the short term, impacting trader sentiment across the market.
