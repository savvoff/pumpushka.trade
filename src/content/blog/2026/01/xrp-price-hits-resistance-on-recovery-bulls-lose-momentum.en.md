## Overview

XRP price experienced a recovery wave above the $2.00 mark but encountered resistance near $2.020. Currently, the price is exhibiting bearish signs, potentially leading to a decline below $1.95. The recent price movements indicate a struggle between buyers and sellers, and the outcome could significantly impact XRP's trajectory.

## Price Recovery and Resistance

XRP began its recovery from the $1.850 support level, mirroring trends seen in other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price managed to rise above the $1.950 and $1.980 levels, entering a short-term positive zone. This upward movement included a spike above the $2.00 mark, but the bullish momentum faltered as sellers emerged near the $2.020 resistance level.

Currently, XRP is trading below $2.00 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, indicating a shift in market sentiment. A new bearish trend line has formed, with resistance identified at $2.030 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. If the price settles below $1.950, it may continue to decline further.

## Market Dynamics

The initial support for XRP lies near the $1.950 level, with a subsequent major support zone around $1.9320. A critical break and close below this level could trigger a further decline toward $1.850. Should the price dip below $1.820, it may face additional downward pressure, possibly reaching $1.750.

On the technical front, the hourly MACD for XRP/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone, suggesting increased selling pressure. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is positioned below the 50 level, reinforcing the bearish sentiment in the market.

## From author

The current price action of XRP reflects a battle between bullish recovery attempts and bearish resistance. The struggle to break through key resistance levels indicates a cautious market sentiment among traders and investors. As XRP hovers around critical support zones, the next moves will be closely watched by market participants. The technical indicators suggest that unless a significant bullish reversal occurs, XRP may continue to face challenges in maintaining upward momentum.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The inability of XRP to break the $2.020 resistance could signal a broader bearish trend for altcoins.

- XRP's performance may influence the movements of other cryptocurrencies, as traders often look to major assets for market cues.
