## Overview

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) recently introduced a plan aimed at integrating blockchain technology to facilitate continuous trading and immediate settlement of stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This initiative also encompasses features related to custody. However, a Columbia professor has expressed skepticism, describing the proposal as akin to "vaporware."

## NYSE's Blockchain Initiative

On Monday, the NYSE announced its ambitious plan to leverage blockchain technology for its trading operations. This initiative aims to revolutionize the trading landscape by allowing for round-the-clock trading and instantaneous settlement of both stocks and ETFs. The significance of this plan lies in its potential to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of financial markets.

The introduction of blockchain technology into trading systems is seen as a major step forward, as it could streamline processes that have traditionally been time-consuming and cumbersome. The proposal includes features that would allow for a more efficient custody of assets, which is crucial in the realm of securities. The NYSE's move reflects a growing trend in the financial industry, where traditional institutions are increasingly exploring the benefits of blockchain.

## Skepticism from Academia

Despite the promising nature of the NYSE's announcement, a Columbia professor has raised concerns regarding the feasibility of the plan. The professor's characterization of the proposal as "vaporware" suggests doubts about its practical implementation and effectiveness. "Vaporware" typically refers to software or technology that is announced but never actually materializes or fails to deliver on its promises. This skepticism highlights the challenges that come with integrating new technologies into established financial systems.

The professor's critique is significant as it underscores the importance of cautious optimism when it comes to technological innovations in finance. While the potential benefits of blockchain are widely recognized, the gap between theoretical applications and actual execution can often be substantial.

## From author

The NYSE's foray into blockchain technology represents a noteworthy development in the ongoing evolution of financial markets. By proposing a system that enables 24/7 trading and instant settlement, the NYSE is positioning itself at the forefront of technological innovation in finance. However, the concerns raised by academia reflect the complexities involved in implementing such transformative changes.

The juxtaposition of ambition and skepticism in this scenario serves as a reminder of the hurdles that must be overcome in the pursuit of integrating blockchain into established financial frameworks. It is crucial for stakeholders to navigate these challenges carefully to ensure that the envisioned benefits of blockchain technology can be realized.
