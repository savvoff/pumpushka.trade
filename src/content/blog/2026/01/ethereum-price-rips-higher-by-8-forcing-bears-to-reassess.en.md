## Overview

Ethereum has experienced a significant price increase, breaking above key resistance levels and prompting a reassessment among bearish traders. Following an upward surge, the cryptocurrency is now consolidating gains, with potential for further movements in the near future.

## Price Movement and Technical Analysis

Ethereum's price began a major upward trend, surpassing the $3,160 resistance level. After rallying to $3,375, the price has entered a corrective phase, trading above $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A pivotal moment occurred when the price broke above a major bearish trend line, which had resistance at $3,140 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD, indicating a shift in market sentiment.

Currently, Ethereum is consolidating its gains, with a high recorded at $3,374. The price is now correcting, but it remains above the critical $3,300 threshold. If the bulls can maintain support above this level or the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent swing low of $3,061 to the high of $3,374, there is potential for another upward movement.

Immediate resistance is observed near the $3,340 mark, with further key resistance levels at $3,380 and $3,420. A decisive move above the $3,420 resistance could pave the way for ETH to approach the $3,500 region. Should this level be surpassed, further gains could materialize, potentially leading to prices in the $3,550 to $3,650 range.

Conversely, if Ethereum fails to breach the $3,340 resistance, it may initiate a downward correction. Initial support is positioned around $3,300, followed by major support at the $3,250 level. A clear drop below $3,250 could trigger a decline towards the $3,220 support and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent price wave. Further losses might lead Ethereum to the $3,180 region.

### Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for ETH/USD is currently losing momentum while remaining in the bullish zone.
- **Hourly RSI**: The RSI for ETH/USD is above the 50 threshold, indicating that the market sentiment is still leaning towards bullish.
