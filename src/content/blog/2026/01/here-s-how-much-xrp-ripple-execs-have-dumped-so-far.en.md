## Overview

Ripple and its executives have been systematically selling XRP for over a decade. This process has raised questions regarding the implications for the market, particularly concerning the overall supply and price dynamics of XRP.

## XRP Allocation and Sales Overview

XRP was launched in 2012 with a total fixed supply of 100 billion tokens, all created simultaneously on the XRP Ledger. Notably, XRP has never been subject to mining, staking, or inflation. From this total supply, 80 billion XRP were allocated to Ripple, the company that emerged from its original formation, while the remaining 20 billion were designated for founders and early insiders.

The original core team included notable figures such as Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. Over the years, the current holdings of Ripple and its executives have become a focal point for assessing how much XRP has been sold or distributed since the initial launch.

As of now, Ripple and named executives collectively control approximately 41.485 billion XRP. Out of this, Ripple itself maintains about 37.685 billion XRP, which is divided into 3.5 billion XRP in accessible wallets and 34.185 billion XRP locked in escrow. The executives include Chris Larsen, who holds around 2.5 billion XRP across eight wallets, and Arthur Britto, who controls approximately 1.3 billion XRP distributed across seven wallets. David Schwartz, despite being a co-founder, holds a significantly smaller amount, with a historical peak of about 26 million XRP.

By subtracting the current holdings from the original allocations, it is calculated that Ripple and its executives have sold or distributed around 58.515 billion XRP since 2012.

## Implications of XRP Sales

The magnitude of these sales has sparked concerns regarding potential long-term price pressure on XRP. However, the timing of these sales is crucial to understanding their impact. The earliest recorded market price for XRP was approximately $0.00587 in August 2013, and it has since risen to around $1.88, representing a significant increase over time.

In 2017, Ripple introduced an escrow system to manage the supply of XRP. This system locked up 55 billion XRP, with a provision allowing the release of up to 1 billion XRP each month. Any portion not utilized is returned to escrow, effectively mitigating unexpected supply shocks. As of 2026, a total of 34.185 billion XRP remains locked under this system.

The cumulative total of 58.515 billion XRP sold over 13 years would be valued at approximately $109 billion at current prices. These sales coincided with ongoing ecosystem development, legal challenges, and various market cycles, indicating that the distribution process has been managed in a phased manner. Despite the significant volume of XRP sold, the careful approach to distribution has not hindered XRP's long-term growth in the market.

## From Author

The approach taken by Ripple and its executives in managing their XRP holdings is noteworthy. The use of an escrow system and a phased selling strategy has allowed for a more controlled distribution of tokens, which has, in turn, contributed to maintaining price stability despite the large volumes sold.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- Ripple's systematic selling of XRP has raised questions about long-term price implications.
- The introduction of an escrow system has helped mitigate sudden supply shocks.
- XRP's price appreciation despite extensive sales suggests a managed distribution strategy.
- The long-term growth of XRP indicates that strategic selling has not adversely affected market dynamics.
- Ongoing legal challenges and ecosystem development continue to shape the market landscape for XRP.
