## Overview

Bitget Wallet is undergoing a significant transformation, evolving from a traditional crypto wallet into an everyday finance application. This shift aims to seamlessly integrate cryptocurrencies with traditional finance (TradFi), reflecting the platform's vision of making crypto accessible to everyone.

## Transition from Crypto Wallet to Finance App

According to Jamie Elkaleh, the Chief Marketing Officer of Bitget Wallet, the platform is expanding its functionality to compete directly with neobanks. This evolution is part of a broader strategy to enhance user experience by providing comprehensive financial services that include both cryptocurrency and traditional financial products. 

The decision to transition into an everyday finance app is driven by the increasing demand for integrated financial solutions among users. As more individuals seek to manage their finances through digital means, the need for platforms that can cater to both crypto and traditional financial needs has become apparent. Elkaleh emphasizes that this is not merely about offering a wallet for cryptocurrencies; rather, it is about creating a holistic financial ecosystem that caters to the diverse needs of users.

The vision of "Crypto for Everyone" underlines the commitment of Bitget Wallet to democratize access to financial services. By merging the capabilities of a crypto wallet with those of a neobank, Bitget aims to provide users with a seamless experience that allows them to manage their assets, whether they are digital currencies or fiat money, all in one place.
