## Overview

Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently experienced a price correction, slipping below the $0.1220 mark against the US Dollar. The digital currency is currently holding onto the $0.120 support level but is at risk of further declines as bearish momentum appears to be gaining traction.

## Price Movement and Market Analysis

Dogecoin's price began to decline after it struggled to break through the $0.1275 resistance level. This downward movement saw DOGE fall below the $0.1250 and $0.1245 thresholds, indicating a loss of bullish momentum. The price has also dipped below a significant bullish trend line with support at $0.1245 on the hourly chart for the DOGE/USD pair.

As of now, Dogecoin is trading beneath the $0.1225 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average, which adds to the bearish sentiment surrounding the asset. Immediate resistance is noted around the $0.1235 level, while the first significant resistance for potential bulls lies near $0.1250. If DOGE manages to close above the $0.1275 resistance, it could set the stage for a move toward higher levels.

Conversely, should DOGE fail to surpass the $0.1250 level, further losses may be on the horizon. Initial support is situated near the $0.120 level, coinciding with the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent upward movement from a swing low of $0.1175 to a high of $0.1275. Additional support levels are found at $0.1192 and the main support at $0.1150. A breakdown below this critical support could lead to significant declines, potentially targeting levels around $0.1080 or even $0.1050.

### Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for DOGE/USD is gaining momentum within the bearish zone, indicating a strengthening downtrend.
- **Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: The RSI is currently below the 50 level, which is often interpreted as a sign of bearish market conditions.
