## Overview

Kaito, a crypto analytics firm, has announced the discontinuation of its reward-driven social product known as "Yaps." This decision comes in response to recent changes made by X, which revised its API policies to reduce spam on the platform. As a result of this shift, Kaito's token has experienced a significant decline.

## Kaito's Shift in Strategy

Kaito is transitioning from its Yaps product to a more selective creator marketing platform. This change is primarily driven by X's updated API policies, which aim to combat spam and improve the overall user experience on the platform. The firm believes that by focusing on a more curated approach, it can provide better value to its users and creators.

The decision to sunset Yaps is significant for Kaito as it reflects a broader trend within the crypto and social media landscape. Companies are increasingly adapting their strategies in response to regulatory changes and platform policies. In Kaito's case, the move away from a reward-driven model indicates a shift towards a more sustainable and quality-focused approach to creator engagement.

## The Impact on Kaito's Token

Following the announcement, Kaito's token saw a notable decline, falling by 17%. This drop can be attributed to investor reactions to the news of the product discontinuation. Market participants often view such changes as a sign of instability or uncertainty, which can lead to sell-offs in the short term.

The volatility in Kaito's token price highlights the sensitivity of the cryptocurrency market to developments within individual projects. Investors are keenly attuned to changes in product offerings and their implications for a company's long-term viability and growth potential.

By moving towards a more selective creator marketing platform, Kaito aims to align itself with current market demands for quality over quantity. However, the immediate impact on its token price serves as a reminder of the risks associated with such strategic shifts.
