## Overview

The cryptocurrency market experienced significant volatility recently, leading to a substantial liquidation of long positions in derivatives markets. This development has raised concerns among traders and investors, as large-scale liquidations can indicate heightened market instability.

## Liquidation Events in the Crypto Market

In the past 24 hours, the crypto sector has witnessed a notable amount of liquidations, totaling $874 million. According to data from CoinGlass, the overwhelming majority of these liquidations, amounting to $788 million, were long contracts. A liquidation occurs when a contract incurs losses beyond a certain threshold, prompting the exchange to forcibly close the position. This phenomenon is common in the digital asset sector, where volatility is often high.

The recent market turbulence was characterized by a sharp drop in the prices of major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, for instance, fell from $95,500 to a low of $93,000. Similarly, Ethereum's price dropped from $3,350 to $3,200. Though the percentage declines may not seem drastic, the rapid pace of these price movements was a critical factor that triggered the liquidations.

The cause of this sudden market downturn may be linked to renewed tariff tensions between the United States and Europe. Reports indicate that the U.S. President announced plans to impose tariffs on eight European nations. Starting February 1st, goods from Denmark, Great Britain, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland will incur an additional 10% import tariff. Furthermore, if the U.S. is not permitted to acquire the Danish territory of Greenland, these tariffs could escalate to 25% by June 1st.

Historically, tariff-related uncertainties have impacted the crypto market, leading to volatility. The latest developments appear to have similarly influenced market dynamics, resulting in a significant number of liquidations.

As per the data, Bitcoin-related contracts accounted for a large share of the liquidations, with approximately $233 million liquidated in the past day. Ethereum followed, with $156 million in liquidations. Among altcoins, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin recorded the highest liquidations, amounting to $61 million, $41 million, and $35 million, respectively. Notably, Solana's larger liquidation volume, despite its smaller market cap compared to XRP, can be attributed to its more significant price decline of 6%, compared to XRP's 4% drop.

Currently, Bitcoin's price has shown a slight rebound, recovering to around $93,100.

## From author

The recent wave of liquidations in the cryptocurrency market underscores the inherent risks associated with trading in a volatile environment. The interplay between macroeconomic factors, such as tariff announcements, and the rapid price movements in cryptocurrencies can create a perfect storm for investors, leading to large-scale liquidations.
