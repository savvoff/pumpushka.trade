## Overview

Crypto analyst Bird has made a significant prediction regarding the potential for XRP to experience its most substantial rally in history. This forecast is largely based on observed trends in Bitcoin's dominance, which has shown a pattern of decline preceding previous XRP surges. 

## Analyst's Insights on XRP Price Rally

In a recent post on X, Bird suggested that XRP is poised for a major price increase due to a notable drop in Bitcoin's dominance. He pointed out that this particular trend has historically coincided with XRP's previous parabolic rallies in 2018, 2021, and the current situation in 2024. Each of these instances saw a substantial decrease in Bitcoin's dominance, which Bird believes is a critical factor for XRP's price movements.

Bird elaborated on the past price actions of XRP, noting that following its all-time high (ATH) between 2018 and 2021, Bitcoin's dominance started to rise again. This increase was followed by a backtest of the trend, which ultimately led to another significant XRP rally in 2021 when Bitcoin's dominance rolled over. 

In 2024, a similar scenario unfolded with a sharp drop in Bitcoin's dominance, which briefly broke down through the established trendline. Although this move did not fully commit, it was sufficient to propel XRP's price to new heights, reaching all-time highs. Bird emphasized that XRP tends to react sensitively to any breakdown in Bitcoin's dominance, even if such breakdowns are temporary.

Currently, Bitcoin's dominance has shown an upward trend from 2023 to 2025, but Bird noted that it recently broke down through this trend and is now experiencing fluctuations and a potential rollover. This area is historically significant for XRP, as previous price surges have occurred under similar conditions. Bird believes that the current setup is even more promising than in the past.

## Potential for Double-Digit XRP Prices

Bird speculated that if a brief, uncommitted breakdown in Bitcoin's dominance could trigger a surge in XRP's price, a confirmed breakdown would have an exponentially stronger effect. He remarked that the next significant price movement could potentially push XRP into double digits and beyond. 

He highlighted a crucial distinction in this scenario: the upcoming move is anticipated to be more than just a temporary fluctuation. Instead, Bird predicts that Bitcoin's dominance will definitively lose its trend and experience a significant drop towards the lower boundary, estimated to be around the 44% to 40% region. When this occurs, Bird believes that XRP's price will not only rise but will enter a phase of true price discovery.

At the time of writing, XRP was reported to be trading at approximately $2.14, reflecting a nearly 5% decline over the past 24 hours.
