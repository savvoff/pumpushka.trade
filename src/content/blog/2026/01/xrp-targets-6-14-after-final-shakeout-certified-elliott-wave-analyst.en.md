## Overview

XRP has been experiencing a prolonged period of consolidation, according to certified Elliott Wave analyst XForceGlobal. He suggests that this range-bound trading may lead to a significant price movement, potentially bringing the token to levels above $5. The analysis indicates that the current market behavior is a part of a larger bullish pattern, which could soon resolve into a decisive upward trend.

## Analysis of XRP's Price Action

In a recent discussion on X, XForceGlobal emphasized that the past year of XRP's trading behavior reflects an Elliott Wave "flat" correction. This pattern is characterized by a stage where neither bulls nor bears can establish a clear trend, leading to a balanced market. The analyst described this balance as not indicative of weakness but rather as a necessary phase before a sharp move occurs. He framed the current market environment as a "Mexican standoff," where buyers and sellers are equally matched, creating a new price floor.

According to XForceGlobal, the prolonged consolidation phase has psychological implications for traders. He believes that this "flat" structure tends to exhaust traders emotionally, making them less reactive when the market finally resolves. The analyst noted that as the flat pattern nears its conclusion, most traders are already fatigued, which could set the stage for a clear path to higher prices.

In terms of Elliott Wave theory, XForceGlobal described the flat correction as comprising three parts: waves A, B, and C. Waves A and B are corrective moves, while wave C is expected to be impulsive, marking the resolution of the earlier balance. The analyst stressed that this impulsive nature is crucial for the market to transition from its current state. He anticipates that the market is currently in an "expanded flat" configuration, where wave B has surpassed previous highs, and he expects a brief downturn before the market shifts upward.

XForceGlobal mentioned that a prior low of $1.70 could be tested again without invalidating the broader bullish setup, provided that the overall support remains intact. He also shared his personal experience, noting that he has been accumulating XRP for a significant period and has taken some profits at certain levels. He expressed that the longer the market consolidates, the higher the potential targets could be, suggesting ranges from $6 to $14 as possibilities.

Furthermore, he indicated that traders should remain vigilant for any "red flags" that could signal a deeper breakdown in the structure, which would necessitate a reassessment of risk management strategies. His analysis emphasizes that while a final shakeout might occur, it could still align with a bullish continuation scenario.
