## Overview

XRP has experienced a decline below the $1.90 mark, indicating persistent selling pressure in the market. This trend has resulted in a cautious atmosphere surrounding XRP's price action, leading to limited recovery attempts and a reassessment of downside risks due to a lack of strong demand.

## Current Market Situation

As XRP trades around $1.89, it has fallen back into a zone where traders are reevaluating potential downside risks. The recent price movement has not shown strong follow-through, and the overall market sentiment remains fragile. According to a report from CryptoQuant, the market appears to be in a state of cautious equilibrium, which is critical for understanding XRP's current price dynamics.

The 200-day moving average is positioned at approximately $2.54, putting XRP roughly 25% below this long-term trend reference. This significant gap signals ongoing structural weakness, as historical trends indicate that sustained bullish phases typically require prices to reclaim and maintain levels above the 200-day moving average. Currently, XRP's distance from this level suggests that it is still operating within a corrective range, where price rallies are more likely to be sold rather than sustained.

## Risk-Adjusted Metrics Indicate Consolidation

The report highlights that XRP's price movements should be evaluated through a risk-adjusted lens. The 30-day Sharpe Ratio, which is close to zero at 0.034, indicates that returns over the past month have offered minimal compensation relative to the risks taken. This lack of clear directional conviction is characteristic of markets in a consolidation phase. During such periods, volatility tends to decrease, and traders become more selective, causing prices to become increasingly sensitive to changes in liquidity.

Conversely, the Sharpe Z-Score has shown a relative improvement at approximately 0.70, suggesting slightly better return quality compared to XRP's recent historical average. However, this level remains below the threshold typically associated with significant trend formation. Selling pressure appears to have lessened but has not transitioned into a phase of strong risk-adjusted performance.

Short-term dynamics further support this cautious outlook, with the 7-day Sharpe Momentum near 0.03. This reflects weak but positive momentum—indicating that while there may be gradual base-building occurring, it is not indicative of impulsive buying behavior.

## Price Action and Moving Averages

XRP's price action continues to highlight a market entrenched in a corrective and defensive phase. Trading between $1.87 and $1.90, XRP has struggled to maintain recent rebounds and remains below all major moving averages. The 50-day moving average is trending downward and acts as dynamic resistance, while both the 100-day and 200-day averages are situated well above the current price, reinforcing a broader bearish structure.

Structurally, the chart reveals a sequence of lower highs and lower lows since the breakdown in October, indicating sustained selling pressure. The sharp decline in early October marked a decisive shift in trend, leading to a consolidation phase within a descending range rather than a reversal base. Attempts to reclaim the $2.10 to $2.20 range have been met with failure, suggesting weak buying follow-through. Moreover, selling spikes during downside movements have outpaced buying volume during rebounds, indicating a defensive market posture rather than accumulation.

## From author

The current state of XRP reflects a market grappling with uncertainty, characterized by a lack of strong directional signals and an ongoing reassessment of risk. The metrics discussed highlight the challenges traders face in navigating this environment, further emphasizing the need for cautious positioning.
