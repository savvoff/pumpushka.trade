## Overview

Recent research from Artemis indicates that spending via crypto credit and debit cards has reached an annualized figure of $18 billion. This development highlights a significant shift in the use of stablecoins, moving from primarily peer-to-peer transfers to everyday payment applications. Visa has emerged as a key player in this transition, securing a dominant position in the on-chain volume through strategic early partnerships.

## Crypto Card Spending Surges

The findings from Artemis research reveal a notable trend in the cryptocurrency landscape. As more consumers adopt crypto for daily transactions, the spending through crypto credit and debit cards has surged to an annualized total of $18 billion. This figure is particularly significant as it suggests a growing acceptance and integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream financial activities.

One of the most critical aspects of this shift is the transition of stablecoin usage. Traditionally, stablecoins have been used mainly for peer-to-peer transfers, allowing users to send money across borders quickly and with minimal fees. However, the increasing adoption of crypto cards signifies a change in consumer behavior, where stablecoins are now being utilized for everyday payments. This transformation indicates a broader trend of integrating cryptocurrencies into daily life, moving beyond speculative trading and investment.

## Visa's Dominance in On-Chain Volume

Visa has positioned itself as a leader in the crypto card space, capturing a substantial portion of the on-chain volume. This success can be attributed to the company's early infrastructure partnerships, which have enabled it to facilitate crypto transactions more effectively. By establishing these partnerships, Visa has not only enhanced its service offerings but has also contributed to the overall growth of the crypto payment ecosystem.

The implications of Visa's dominance are significant. As the company continues to expand its reach in the crypto market, it may set the standard for how other financial institutions approach the integration of cryptocurrencies into their services. This could lead to a more competitive landscape, where various companies strive to provide innovative solutions for consumers looking to use digital currencies for everyday transactions.
