## Overview

The cryptocurrency Aave (AAVE) has recently experienced a significant price decline, falling nearly 10% to a local bottom of around $153. As it currently trades within a range of $155-$160, market analysts are observing a critical price structure that may lead to a breakout, particularly focused on the $145 support level.

## Current Price Action

The recent downturn in Aave's price coincides with a broader decline across the cryptocurrency market. Following this trend, AAVE has been trading within a falling wedge formation, a chart pattern often indicative of consolidation after sustained selling pressure. This pattern is characterized by a series of lower highs and a stable support level, which in Aave's case is near the $145 region.

Market expert Ali Martinez highlighted the AAVEUSD 4-hour chart, noting that the price action has formed a significant descending structure since Aave's peak above $350. This corrective move has seen AAVE step down through various horizontal support levels at $240, $200, and $162. The loss of these critical zones has shifted short-term momentum firmly into the hands of sellers, making the $145 support level increasingly vital for future price direction.

Currently, Aave's price hovers in the mid $150s, leaving little room before a potential retest of the $144.93 support. This level has demonstrated its importance as a demand zone multiple times during the ongoing downtrend. If the price breaks cleanly below $145, it could trigger an accelerated downside move, with the next major support level identified around $125.

Conversely, maintaining the $145 support may set the stage for a technical rebound. If Aave successfully defends this level and breaks above the descending trendline, it could potentially reclaim higher resistance zones around $162 and possibly $200 in the future. While such a rebound would not immediately negate the larger bearish trend, it could indicate a shift toward improved market balance and reduced selling pressure.

## From author

The analysis of Aave's current price structure underscores the volatility and uncertainty that can characterize the cryptocurrency market. As traders closely monitor the $145 support level, the potential for either a rebound or further decline remains a critical focal point. The falling wedge pattern provides insights into market sentiment, suggesting that while sellers have had the upper hand, buyers are poised to defend key support levels.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Aave's performance is reflective of broader market trends, emphasizing the interconnectedness of cryptocurrencies.
- The $145 support level serves as a critical point of interest for traders, influencing market sentiment and trading strategies.
- The potential for increased volatility in Aave's price may lead to significant trading activity in the coming sessions.
- A break below $145 could signal further bearish pressure not only for Aave but potentially for other altcoins as well.
- Conversely, a successful defense of the $145 support could inspire confidence among traders, potentially leading to a broader market rally.
