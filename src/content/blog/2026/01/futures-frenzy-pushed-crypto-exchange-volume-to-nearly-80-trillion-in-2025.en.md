## Overview

In 2025, global crypto exchange trading volume surged to over $79 trillion, primarily driven by futures and perpetual contracts. This significant increase resulted in derivatives dominating market activity, while the growth of spot trading remained relatively modest.

## What Happened

Reports indicate that the trading landscape for cryptocurrencies underwent a notable transformation in 2025. The overall exchange trading volume reached more than $79 trillion, with futures and perpetual contracts accounting for the majority of this activity. Specifically, futures and perpetuals totaled close to $62 trillion, which represented approximately 77% of the combined exchange volume. In contrast, spot trading concluded the year at around $18.6 trillion, reflecting a growth of roughly 9% compared to the previous year.

The dramatic rise in futures trading can be attributed to traders' preferences for using these instruments to take positions, hedge exposures, and quickly respond to market movements. Futures contracts allow for a greater notional flow than traditional spot trades, which has contributed to the heightened daily turnover and overall trading volume. 

Binance emerged as the standout exchange during this period, handling a significant portion of the Bitcoin perpetual futures market. Reports suggest that Binance processed about $25.4 trillion in Bitcoin perpetual futures alone, which accounted for around 42% of the top 10 platforms’ Bitcoin perpetual volume. Other exchanges like OKX, Bybit, and Bitget also played important roles in the futures trading landscape but operated at a secondary tier compared to Binance.

While the figures reported for derivatives trading varied across different platforms, the consensus remained that derivatives had taken the lead in market activity. For instance, some sources, such as CoinGlass, reported even higher derivatives volumes, estimating them at about $85.7 trillion for the year. The discrepancies in reported figures can be attributed to differences in counting methods, the products included, and the venues covered.

## From author

The data from 2025 reveals a shifting dynamic within the crypto trading ecosystem, wherein derivatives have established a commanding presence. This trend raises several questions about market stability and the implications of such concentration in trading activity on a few major platforms. The growing reliance on futures and perpetual contracts may signal a maturing market, yet it also highlights potential risks associated with regulatory scrutiny and market volatility.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The dominance of derivatives could lead to increased volatility in the crypto market, as traders react to rapid price movements.
- A concentration of trading on a few exchanges raises concerns about systemic risks, particularly if these platforms encounter operational issues or regulatory challenges.
- The growth of futures trading may attract more institutional investors, potentially leading to further market maturation.
- Regulatory changes affecting stablecoins and derivatives could significantly reshape trading volumes and market dynamics in the coming years.
- The varying methodologies for reporting trading volumes suggest that market participants should be cautious when interpreting data, as it can impact perceptions of market health and activity.
