## Overview

SUI has recently shown signs of renewed strength after successfully reclaiming a critical high-timeframe support zone. Following a significant selloff, the price has stabilized above this level, suggesting that the downside deviation may be complete. This stabilization could lead to increased momentum and focus on a potential next target.

## SUI Reclaims Critical HTF Support After Sharp Selloff

Crypto analyst Scient highlighted in a post on X that SUI's recent price action is unfolding as expected after a sharp selloff. The market has pushed back above a key high-timeframe (HTF) support zone, which had previously acted as an important pivot area. This reclaim indicates that the brief move below support was a deviation rather than a structural breakdown. With the price now stabilizing and forming a base, SUI appears to be in a more favorable position.

The area designated as the grey box on the chart is identified as a crucial demand and decision zone. Maintaining a position above this area keeps the bullish reclaim intact, indicating that buyers still hold control at higher timeframes. Conversely, if the price were to move back below this zone, it would invalidate the setup and shift the focus toward downside risk, making this area pivotal for the next movement.

As long as SUI holds and builds acceptance above this base, Scient anticipates a steady upward trend toward the next resistance area. A clean push into this zone could potentially open the door for further expansion, contingent on improving momentum. Notably, this structure is also appearing across multiple assets, with many charts displaying similar high-timeframe PO3 accumulation patterns. In this broader context, SUI stands out for its decisive reclaim of key support, positioning it as one of the more constructive setups in the market.

## SUI Leads With Early 4H Trend Break

According to an update by Daan Crypto Trades, SUI was among the first major assets to break above its 4-hour downtrend and push decisively out of the prevailing range. This early breakout signals clear relative strength, placing SUI ahead of many of its peers and suggesting it could be a potential leader if broader market conditions improve.

At present, the price is consolidating directly above the former resistance area, which now serves as key support. Holding this level would suggest a reclaim of the range and increase the likelihood of upward continuation. Conversely, losing this area could risk a return to consolidation and weaken the overall bullish structure. While SUI continues to look strong among major assets, confirmation through renewed momentum is still needed to propel it higher.

It is important to note that SUI’s progress remains closely tied to the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which currently lack a clear directional trend.

## From author

The recent developments surrounding SUI are noteworthy as they reflect a potential shift in market sentiment. The reclaiming of high-timeframe support could indicate a change in the trend, making it essential to monitor how SUI interacts with this critical zone moving forward. The broader context, including the performance of other major cryptocurrencies, will likely influence SUI’s trajectory in the coming days.

## Impact on the crypto market

- SUI's reclaiming of key support may signal a shift in investor sentiment, potentially influencing other cryptocurrencies.
- The stabilization above the support zone suggests a possible end to the recent selloff, which could encourage buying activity.
- SUI's relative strength compared to peers may attract more attention from traders looking for potential leaders in the market.
- The performance of SUI could serve as a barometer for broader market trends, particularly in relation to Bitcoin and Ethereum.
- A successful push into the next resistance area may lead to increased bullish activity across the market.
