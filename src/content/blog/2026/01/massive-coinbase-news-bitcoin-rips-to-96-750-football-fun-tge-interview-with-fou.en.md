## Overview

The cryptocurrency market experienced significant movements, with Bitcoin reaching a new two-month high. Key developments surrounding regulatory actions and institutional engagements have also influenced market dynamics.

## Bitcoin and Major Cryptocurrencies Surge

Bitcoin has achieved a notable milestone by hitting a two-month high, showing an increase of 2% and reaching a price point of $96,750. Ethereum also saw a rise of 2%, bringing its price to $3,360. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana, remained stable at $145, while XRP experienced a slight decline of 1%, trading at $2.11. Noteworthy performers in the market included Decred, which surged by 30%, Dash with a 10% increase, as well as Internet Computer and Zcash, both rising by 10% and 7%, respectively. Monero reached a new all-time high of $800 before retracing to $725.

## Regulatory Developments Impacting the Market

Coinbase has recently withdrawn its support for the Senate’s proposed crypto market structure bill, citing significant concerns regarding the latest draft. This decision was influential enough to prompt the Senate to delay the voting process on the bill. The implications of this move could have far-reaching effects on the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the United States, as the bill's passage was anticipated by many in the industry.

In a separate development, the Zcash Foundation announced that the investigation by the SEC into Zcash has concluded, allowing the cryptocurrency to avoid any regulatory action. This news is significant for Zcash holders and may contribute to renewed investor confidence in the asset.

Ripple has made strides in its European expansion by securing a license in Luxembourg. This development aligns with Ripple's ongoing efforts to establish a stronger presence in the European market, which could be beneficial for its operations and partnerships in the region.

Additionally, Pakistan is exploring the use of stablecoins for remittances and cross-border payments through a partnership with World Liberty Financial. This initiative could pave the way for increased adoption of stablecoins in emerging markets, potentially transforming the remittance landscape.

The Human Rights Foundation has awarded nearly $1.3 million in Bitcoin grants to projects focused on human rights and freedom technology. This funding is aimed at supporting initiatives that leverage blockchain technology to promote social causes.

On the technology front, Figure has introduced a new public equity network designed for the on-chain issuance of stocks and related assets. This could represent a significant innovation in how traditional finance interacts with blockchain technology.

FTX is preparing for another round of creditor payments and has provided details regarding the timing for the next distribution, which is set for March 31. This process is part of ongoing efforts to address creditor claims following the platform's operational challenges.

Lastly, the Sui network resumed operations after a nearly six-hour stall, raising questions about its reliability and performance under stress.
