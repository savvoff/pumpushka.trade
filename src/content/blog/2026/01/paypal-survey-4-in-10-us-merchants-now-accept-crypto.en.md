## Overview

A recent survey conducted by PayPal and the National Cryptocurrency Association reveals that a significant portion of US merchants are now embracing cryptocurrency as a payment option. Approximately four in ten merchants have integrated crypto into their checkout processes, driven largely by customer interest and demand.

## Merchant Adoption of Cryptocurrency

According to the survey findings, about 39% of merchants in the United States have added cryptocurrency to their payment options. This shift in payment acceptance is attributed to increased inquiries from customers regarding the use of crypto for transactions. The data indicates that 88% of merchants have received questions about accepting cryptocurrency, with 69% reporting at least monthly demand for such payment options.

The survey also highlights that a substantial number of merchants, around 84%, anticipate that crypto payments will become commonplace within the next five years. This expectation reflects a growing belief among business leaders in the future integration of digital currencies into everyday commerce.

## Variability in Adoption Rates

The adoption of cryptocurrency among merchants is not uniform across all business sizes. Larger companies, particularly those with annual revenues exceeding $500 million, are at the forefront of this movement, with about 50% of them accepting crypto payments. In contrast, smaller businesses show a lower adoption rate of approximately 34%, while mid-sized firms report about 32% acceptance. 

Certain sectors are driving the adoption of cryptocurrency more vigorously than others. Industries such as travel and hospitality, gaming, digital goods, and higher-end retail are leading the charge, likely due to their online sales strategies and tech-savvy customer bases.

## The Impact of Cryptocurrency on Sales

For merchants that have already adopted cryptocurrency, the impact on sales is notable. Reports suggest that digital assets constitute more than a quarter of sales for some sellers. Moreover, around 72% of merchants who accept crypto indicated that their sales in this area have grown over the past year. This growth in crypto sales provides a compelling reason for businesses to maintain and expand their cryptocurrency payment options.

## Challenges and Opportunities

Despite the increasing interest in cryptocurrency, many merchants face barriers to adoption. A prevalent concern is the complexity of setting up crypto payment systems. The survey found that about 90% of merchants would consider accepting cryptocurrency if the process were as straightforward as processing credit card transactions. Key issues include the need for better payment tools and integration solutions.

Merchants cite several motivations for accepting cryptocurrency, including faster payment processing, the potential to attract new customers, and enhanced buyer privacy. Younger generations, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, are significant drivers of this trend, often requesting the option to pay with crypto at checkout.

## What Merchants Want Next

The survey, conducted in October 2025 and involving 619 payment strategy decision-makers across various sectors, highlighted the desire for simpler tools and clearer regulations. Executives believe that if merchants can access easier on-ramps and reliable settlement processes, the acceptance of cryptocurrency could accelerate significantly.

## From author

The findings from the PayPal and National Cryptocurrency Association survey illustrate a pivotal moment in the integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream commerce. As merchants respond to customer demand and seek to enhance their payment options, the landscape of retail and service provision may continue to evolve.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased acceptance of cryptocurrency among US merchants indicates a growing mainstream recognition of digital assets.
- Higher adoption rates among larger companies could lead to more significant investments in cryptocurrency infrastructure.
- The trend of younger consumers favoring crypto payments suggests that future market dynamics may increasingly revolve around digital currencies.
- Challenges in payment setup highlight the need for improved technology and regulatory clarity to facilitate broader adoption.
- Growth in crypto sales among accepting merchants may incentivize more businesses to explore digital currency options.
