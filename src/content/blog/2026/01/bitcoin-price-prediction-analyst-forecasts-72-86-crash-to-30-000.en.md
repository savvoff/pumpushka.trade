## Overview

A recent Bitcoin price prediction has emerged from a long-term technical analysis shared on social media by crypto analyst Leshka.eth. The analysis suggests that Bitcoin's current price behavior mirrors patterns observed during previous market peaks, indicating a potential significant corrective move that could bring the price down to $30,000.

## Technical Analysis of Bitcoin's Price Action

The analysis focuses on Bitcoin's price action observed on the weekly candlestick chart, revealing a trend of higher highs and higher lows that has been consistent since 2018. This upward trend culminates in interactions with a rising resistance trendline that has historically defined major cycle tops for Bitcoin. The historical context indicates that during each bull market, Bitcoin has approached this upper boundary, only to face rejection when momentum diminishes.

The analysis highlights key rejection points from previous cycles, notably during the peaks of 2017 and 2021. These points mark significant moments of price exhaustion following extended periods of upward movement. Recently, Bitcoin rallied into this long-term trendline and achieved new all-time highs in October 2025 before experiencing a downturn. Currently, Bitcoin is trading below $90,000, and the analysis posits that the ongoing pullback may not yet be complete, suggesting further declines could be on the horizon.

## Potential for a Significant Price Decline

Leshka.eth's analysis draws attention to the historical depth of bear market declines following rejections at this long-term trendline. After the 2017 cycle top, Bitcoin experienced a decline of approximately 84.99%. Similarly, following the 2021 high, the cryptocurrency fell by about 77.47% before stabilizing near the lower boundary of its broader rising channel. Given the current market setup, the analysis estimates a potential downside move of around 72.86%, which could position Bitcoin's price near $30,000.

In contrast to this bearish outlook, Grok AI has presented a more optimistic perspective regarding Bitcoin's near-term price trajectory. According to Grok, insights gathered from various sources indicate that the likelihood of Bitcoin dropping into the $30,000 to $40,000 range is relatively low, with estimates suggesting a probability of around 15% to 25%. Many analysts anticipate higher price floors, often projecting values above $50,000. Long-term projections from some analysts even suggest targets exceeding $200,000.

## From author

The analysis shared by Leshka.eth illustrates the cyclical nature of Bitcoin's price movements and the historical patterns that may influence future price behavior. While the bearish scenario of a decline to $30,000 is supported by technical observations, the contrasting views from Grok AI and other analysts highlight the complexity and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market. As Bitcoin continues to navigate its current price dynamics, it remains crucial for investors to consider both the risks and potential opportunities that lie ahead.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The analysis underscores the volatility and cyclical nature of Bitcoin, influencing investor sentiment and trading strategies.
- A predicted decline to $30,000 could trigger panic selling among investors, potentially leading to a broader market downturn.
- Contrasting bullish projections from other analysts may create a divided sentiment in the market, impacting trading volumes and liquidity.
- The ongoing discussion about Bitcoin's price behavior reflects the heightened interest in cryptocurrency and its potential impact on traditional financial markets.
- As analysts share differing views, market participants may seek to reassess their investment strategies based on the evolving technical landscape.
