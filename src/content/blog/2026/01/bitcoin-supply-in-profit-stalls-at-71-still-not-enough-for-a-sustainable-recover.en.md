## Overview

Bitcoin is currently experiencing a significant test as volatility resurfaces, with its price fluctuating around the $90,000 mark. While bulls are striving to maintain this crucial psychological level, the overall market sentiment remains fragile, leading many traders to approach recent price movements with caution.

## Market Conditions

As Bitcoin's price action stabilizes around $90,000, the market is grappling with uncertainty. Bulls are attempting to defend this critical zone following a turbulent period, but confidence remains low. Traders are wary, treating each upward movement as a potential trap rather than an indication of a confirmed recovery. This cautious sentiment underscores the precarious nature of the current market dynamics.

According to analyst Darkfost, a primary obstacle to a sustainable bullish trend is the lack of a broad base of investors sitting in profit. While Bitcoin has shown resilience, the current market conditions do not provide enough participants in positive territory to foster the structural comfort necessary for long-term uptrends. This situation is crucial because when most holders are in profit, the market tends to stabilize, reducing the pressure to sell and mitigating panic.

However, Darkfost also highlights that profit dynamics can turn adverse. When unrealized gains become excessively high across the market, they can lead to overhead supply, which may trigger corrective phases. The profit distribution among holders can act as a double-edged sword for Bitcoin. Historically, when the supply in profit exceeds 95%, it tends to create pressure rather than support, prompting investors to take profits during periods of volatility.

## Current Profit Structure

At present, Bitcoin's supply in profit is sitting at approximately 71%, having previously dipped to 64%. Darkfost notes that such low readings often signal the early stages of bear markets, even if the apparent drawdown appears limited. The recent decline, which saw a significant portion of buyers enter the market late, has left many underwater. A brief rebound did push the supply in profit back to 75%, but this was not sustained, indicating that many investors used the opportunity to exit positions at breakeven or to mitigate losses.

Going forward, reclaiming the 75% to 80% supply-in-profit threshold is essential for signaling stabilization. If the market continues to weaken, it could lead to increased panic-driven selling, exacerbating the existing volatility.

## From author

The current state of Bitcoin's market reflects a complex interplay of investor sentiment and profit distribution dynamics. The struggle to maintain a solid base of profit-holding participants is critical for any potential recovery. As the market grapples with volatility and uncertainty, the need for a more robust investor sentiment becomes increasingly apparent.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The current profit distribution suggests that many recent buyers are operating at a loss, which could heighten selling pressure.
- The inability to sustain a rebound above crucial resistance levels indicates a fragile market structure.
- The market's reliance on the 71% profit threshold highlights the importance of investor sentiment in determining future price movements.
- A failure to reclaim the 75% to 80% supply-in-profit range may lead to increased volatility and corrective phases.
- Traders are approaching market movements with caution, potentially limiting bullish momentum and recovery efforts.
