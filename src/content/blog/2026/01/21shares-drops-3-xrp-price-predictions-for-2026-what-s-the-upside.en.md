## Overview

21Shares has presented a three-scenario price outlook for XRP in 2026, suggesting a significant shift in how the token is valued. This change is expected to stem from the resolution of ongoing litigation and the subsequent influence of institutional demand and on-ledger adoption.

## XRP's Transition to Institutional Fundamentals

In a research note, 21Shares indicates that XRP is poised to transition from a trade defined by litigation to one driven by demand from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and measurable on-ledger adoption. The firm highlights that the settlement reached in August 2025, which resolved a case with the SEC, will mark a pivotal moment for XRP's valuation. This resolution is seen as a removal of structural constraints that previously limited the token’s upside potential, regardless of its underlying utility.

### Post-Settlement Environment

Following the settlement, 21Shares anticipates a more challenging environment for XRP. The firm notes that without the backdrop of courtroom drama or regulatory uncertainty, XRP will need to depend on actual usage and adoption to sustain its valuation. This shift introduces a potential risk where market participants might “sell the news” if XRP's usage does not scale as expected.

### Expanding the Buyer Base

21Shares believes that the clarity brought by the settlement will broaden the addressable buyer base for XRP. The firm suggests that US-based institutions, regulated funds, and financial entities like banks and payment companies, which were previously hindered by compliance risks, will now re-enter the market. This re-engagement is viewed as a new phase for price discovery.

## Demand Dynamics and ETF Influence

The report emphasizes the significant impact of US spot XRP ETFs on the token's demand profile. In their first month, these ETFs reportedly amassed over $1.3 billion in assets under management and experienced a sustained period of inflows. 21Shares argues that the combination of ETF absorption and a retail community that is reluctant to sell creates a powerful “primary engine” for XRP's potential repricing.

However, the firm also cautions that this dynamic could shift if inflows begin to slow. The reference to the first year of US Bitcoin spot ETFs serves as a contextual benchmark, illustrating how high inflows can lead to substantial price movements.

## Utility and Growth Potential

21Shares positions XRP Ledger (XRPL) as a crucial infrastructure for tokenization and stablecoin settlement. The growth of RLUSD and the expansion of XRPL’s decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) are highlighted as indicators of XRPL's increasing utility. Nevertheless, the firm acknowledges execution risks, noting that progress in this area is evolutionary rather than explosive and that XRPL faces competition from other ecosystems.

### Price Predictions

21Shares has modeled three potential price scenarios for XRP in 2026: a base case at $2.45, a bull case at $2.69, and a bear case at $1.60. Key factors influencing these outcomes include sustained ETF inflows, significant tokenization volumes, and the continued traction of RLUSD within institutional circles.

## From author

The research presented by 21Shares offers a detailed analysis of XRP's potential trajectory in a post-litigation landscape. By focusing on institutional demand and the practical applications of XRPL, the firm highlights both opportunities and challenges for the token. The outlined scenarios underscore the importance of market dynamics and utility in determining XRP's future value.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The resolution of the SEC case is expected to enhance institutional interest in XRP.
- Increased ETF activity may significantly alter XRP's demand dynamics.
- A clearer regulatory environment could lead to broader adoption of XRPL as a financial infrastructure.
- The potential for XRP's price to reach new highs hinges on sustained inflows and real-world utility.
- Execution risks and competition from other ecosystems could impact XRP's market position.
