## Overview

XRP spot trading has officially launched on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid, following the listing of Flare’s FXRP. This new development enables users to trade XRP through Hyperliquid’s on-chain order book, providing a novel trading avenue for XRP holders and traders. Additionally, FXRP can be bridged back to the XRP Ledger, enhancing the liquidity and utility of XRP in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

## What Happened

The introduction of FXRP on Hyperliquid marks a significant milestone for the XRP ecosystem. FXRP is a wrapped version of XRP designed specifically for trading on decentralized platforms. By utilizing Hyperliquid’s on-chain order book, traders can engage in spot trading of XRP in a decentralized manner. This move is crucial as it opens up new opportunities for users to trade XRP without relying on centralized exchanges.

The ability to bridge FXRP back to the XRP Ledger is another noteworthy feature. This bridging capability allows for seamless movement between the FXRP token on Hyperliquid and the native XRP on the XRP Ledger. This means that users can easily convert their FXRP back to XRP, thereby maintaining flexibility and liquidity in their trading strategies. The integration of FXRP into the Hyperliquid platform not only enhances accessibility for XRP traders but also reinforces the interoperability of different blockchain ecosystems.
