## Overview

Ethereum has been experiencing an extended period of sideways price action, raising concerns among long-term bullish investors. Despite this stagnation, a recent technical analysis suggests that Ethereum might be on the verge of significant price movement, potentially leading to new all-time highs.

## Current Price Action

Ethereum's price has been stuck in a sideways trend for several months, which has tested the patience of many investors who maintain a bullish outlook. However, it is notable that Ethereum achieved a new all-time high in 2025. A technical analysis shared on X by Egrag Crypto provides insights into this ongoing price behavior by utilizing an inverted monthly chart of Ethereum. This approach presents a unique perspective on what seems to be a period of stagnation that is poised to break into new price highs.

## Analyzing the Inverted Chart

The analysis hinges on the concept of an inverted monthly chart, which challenges traditional interpretations of price movements. Egrag Crypto's findings indicate that Ethereum's inverted chart reveals a consistent pattern that has evolved over time across various market cycles. Historically, previous price cycles exhibited short accumulation phases followed by aggressive price movements. 

For instance, in 2016, Ethereum experienced about ten months of trading within a range before a sudden drop occurred. Similarly, between mid-2018 and mid-2020, a prolonged consolidation phase preceded a gradual decline. In contrast, the current cycle has seen a much longer accumulation phase. According to Egrag Crypto, this suggests that any subsequent drop might be shorter compared to earlier cycles.

## Implications of the Inverted Chart

One crucial aspect of this analysis is the inverted nature of the chart. What appears to be a downside move in this context actually indicates potential upside expansion on Ethereum's actual price chart. Egrag Crypto posits that once Ethereum breaks free from its current range, the ensuing price movement is likely to occur swiftly. While this movement may not replicate the explosive rallies seen in earlier cycles, it is anticipated to be more orderly and sustained, potentially propelling Ethereum to new price highs.

In terms of resistance levels, Egrag Crypto identifies the $3,800 to $4,500 range as the first critical area that Ethereum must clear to confirm a bullish continuation. Only after a decisive move above this range would the higher target zone of $6,000 to $7,500 come into play. 

Furthermore, the analysis outlines a risk scenario: a pullback to the $1,800 to $2,200 region could delay the anticipated breakout but would not invalidate the overall bullish thesis as long as Ethereum maintains its broader consolidation structure.

## From author
