## Overview

ARK Invest, led by Cathie Wood, has filed for two cryptocurrency index exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are linked to the CoinDesk 20 index. One of these proposed funds aims to replicate the CoinDesk 20 index precisely, while the other is designed to track the index but will exclude bitcoin from its holdings.

## What Happened

The recent filing by ARK Invest marks a significant move in the cryptocurrency investment landscape. The CoinDesk 20 index is a well-known benchmark that measures the performance of a selection of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding bitcoin. By proposing two distinct ETFs, ARK Invest is catering to different investor preferences and market strategies.

The first fund's objective to mimic the CoinDesk 20 index directly suggests that ARK Invest recognizes the importance of providing investors with exposure to a diversified range of cryptocurrencies. This approach allows for a broader investment strategy that can potentially mitigate risks associated with individual cryptocurrencies. 

The second fund, which aims to track the CoinDesk 20 index while excluding bitcoin, indicates a strategic focus on altcoins. This could appeal to investors who are looking to diversify their portfolios away from bitcoin, which has historically dominated the cryptocurrency market. By offering an ETF that excludes bitcoin, ARK Invest is acknowledging the growing interest in other cryptocurrencies and the potential for these assets to perform independently of bitcoin's price movements.

Additionally, this move aligns with the ongoing trend of institutional interest in cryptocurrency investment vehicles. As more investors seek regulated and accessible ways to invest in cryptocurrencies, ETFs have become a popular choice. The filing by ARK Invest could further stimulate interest in the cryptocurrency market, especially among institutional investors who may be looking for diversified investment options.

By providing options that cater to both traditional and non-traditional investors, ARK Invest is positioning itself as a leader in the cryptocurrency investment space. The strategic focus on the CoinDesk 20 index, along with the exclusion of bitcoin in one of the funds, reflects an understanding of the market dynamics and investor preferences.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, the introduction of these ETFs could pave the way for further innovation in investment products. The potential for increased participation from both retail and institutional investors may also contribute to the overall growth of the market.
