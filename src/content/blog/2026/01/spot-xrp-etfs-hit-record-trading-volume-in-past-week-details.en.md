## Overview

The recent surge in trading volume for spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represents a significant development in the cryptocurrency market. Despite experiencing its first negative outflow day, the XRP ETFs achieved a record trading volume, highlighting a growing interest among investors.

## XRP ETFs Reach Record Trading Volume

The spot XRP ETFs launched in the United States have emerged as a notable success in the latter part of 2025, particularly in the final quarter. Notably, these crypto-linked products have contributed to a substantial influx of capital into the altcoin over recent months. The past week marked a milestone for the XRP ETFs, as they recorded their highest trading volume since their debut, reaching $219 million. This volume is nearly double the previous week's trading figure of $117.4 million.

This accomplishment not only sets a new record for weekly trading volume but also surpasses the previous high of $213.9 million achieved in the third week of December 2025. Such a performance indicates a rising demand for XRP ETFs, even as interest in the broader crypto ETF market appears to be declining.

Despite this impressive weekly performance, the US-based XRP ETFs faced their first negative outflow day during the past week, with a net outflow of $40.8 million recorded on January 7. However, this setback did not prevent the ETFs from concluding the week positively, as they still managed to accumulate an additional $38.07 million in value by the week ending January 9. 

As of now, the total net assets for the spot XRP ETFs have reached $1.47 billion since their launch in mid-November 2025. Among these, Canary Capital’s XRPC leads with $375.1 million in assets under management (AUM), followed by Bitwise’s XRP fund at $300.3 million, and Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ at $279.6 million.

## Market Context: XRP ETFs vs. Other Crypto ETFs

While the XRP ETFs are thriving, the overall crypto ETF market is experiencing a challenging period. Established Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have faced significant withdrawals. Recent data reveals that these crypto funds experienced a combined withdrawal of $749.6 million during the first full trading week of the year. Specifically, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest single-day net outflows of $486.1 million on January 7, closing the week with total net outflows exceeding $681 million. 

In contrast, the Ethereum ETF market initially saw positive inflows of $168.1 million and $114.7 million on January 5 and January 6, respectively, but ultimately ended the week with a net withdrawal of $68.6 million.

## From author

The contrasting performance of XRP ETFs compared to their Bitcoin and Ethereum counterparts raises questions about investor sentiment and market dynamics. While XRP ETFs are achieving record trading volumes and attracting substantial capital, other crypto ETFs are struggling with significant outflows. This divergence could indicate a shift in investor preference or confidence within the cryptocurrency space.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The record trading volume for XRP ETFs suggests a growing investor interest in this specific asset class.
- The negative outflows in the broader crypto ETF market may point to declining confidence in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.
- The successful performance of XRP ETFs could influence other crypto products, potentially leading to increased competition in the ETF space.
- The capital influx into XRP ETFs contrasts sharply with the withdrawal trends seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, indicating a potential reallocation of investment strategies among traders.
- Continued growth in the XRP ETF market could serve as a barometer for overall market sentiment, especially regarding altcoins.
