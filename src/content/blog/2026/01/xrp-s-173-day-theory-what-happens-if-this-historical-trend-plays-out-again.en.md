## Overview

A crypto analyst has identified a recurring chart pattern in XRP's price movements, centered around a 173-day cycle. This pattern has historically preceded significant price expansions for XRP, suggesting that the cryptocurrency may be on the verge of a similar rally if the trend continues.

## Analysis of the 173-Day Cycle

The analyst, known as ‘Bird,’ has drawn attention to a specific formation on XRP’s daily chart. His analysis focuses on a pattern that resembles the one observed before a notable breakout in 2025. Bird highlights that XRP's current price formation mirrors the earlier chart structure and time cycle closely.

On the left side of Bird's chart, he illustrates that it took approximately 173 days for XRP to break out after reaching its first major peak in 2025. This phase is marked by vertical blue lines, indicating that the price moved within a descending wedge pattern. During this period, each rally was lower than the previous one, yet support levels remained relatively stable. The trading volume during this phase was around $1.8 billion, indicating that the breakout occurred with steady market participation rather than thin liquidity.

On the right side of the chart, which represents the current market cycle for XRP, Bird points out that a similar pattern is forming. Since the peak in July 2025, XRP has spent about 173 days moving sideways within a descending wedge. However, the trading volume has been lower than in the past cycle, averaging around $1 billion. Despite the decreased volume, the shape and timing of the current pattern closely align with historical trends.

Bird emphasizes that XRP has not broken below key support levels despite facing months of downward pressure. Instead of falling, the price has been squeezed into a tighter range within the same descending wedge pattern. As it approaches the tip of the wedge, XRP has maintained its position near the $1.94 level. According to the analyst, this behavior suggests that the market is not moving sideways randomly but is entering a late-stage compression phase, potentially setting the stage for a larger upward move.

## From author

The identification of this 173-day cycle in XRP's price movements provides an interesting perspective on potential future trends. While the analysis indicates a historical precedent for significant price movements following this pattern, the current market dynamics, including trading volume, add another layer of complexity. Observing how XRP behaves as it nears the apex of the wedge could yield valuable insights into market sentiment and future price action.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The recognition of a 173-day cycle may attract traders and investors looking for patterns in XRP's price movements.
- If XRP experiences a breakout as suggested, it could lead to increased trading activity and interest in the cryptocurrency.
- The situation highlights the importance of historical patterns in predicting future market behavior, potentially influencing trading strategies across the crypto space.
