## Overview

The recent crypto market crash in October has significantly affected trading dynamics, as highlighted in BitMEX's annual report. According to the report, the crash has left market makers with an excess of coins, which in turn has slowed down trading activities across the market.

## Impact of the October Crash

BitMEX's annual report provides insights into how the October crash has reshaped market liquidity and trading strategies. The report emphasizes that one of the most immediate consequences of the crash is the accumulation of coins by market makers. This accumulation is a direct result of the volatility that characterized the market during this period.

Market makers play a crucial role in providing liquidity to the crypto markets. Their ability to facilitate trades depends heavily on maintaining a balanced inventory of assets. However, the October crash disrupted this balance, leading to an oversupply of coins in their possession. As a result, these market makers are now facing challenges in executing trades efficiently.

The report also touches on the implications for basis trades, which are strategies that involve taking advantage of price discrepancies between the spot and futures markets. With market makers holding a surplus of coins, the execution of basis trades has become more complicated. This situation may hinder the ability of traders to capitalize on potential arbitrage opportunities, thereby impacting overall market efficiency.

Additionally, the report highlights other key issues that have arisen due to the crash. These include a decrease in trading volumes and a shift in how traders approach their strategies. The market's overall liquidity has been affected, which can lead to wider spreads and increased costs for traders looking to enter or exit positions.

The surplus of coins held by market makers is a critical issue that could have lasting effects on market dynamics. As traders adjust their strategies in response to the current environment, it remains to be seen how these changes will influence future trading activities.

The ongoing challenges faced by market makers are a reminder of the volatility inherent in the crypto markets. The ability of market participants to adapt to these changes will be vital in navigating the post-crash landscape.
