## Overview

Bitcoin has recently experienced a significant price increase, moving above $92,500 and currently trading above $95,000. This upward momentum has sparked discussions around the potential for Bitcoin to reach the $100,000 mark, which has become a notable narrative in the market.

## Price Movement Analysis

The price of Bitcoin began its upward trajectory by surpassing the $92,000 and $94,500 levels. It managed to maintain a position above the $90,500 support, indicating a strong bullish sentiment. A critical technical development occurred when Bitcoin broke above a contracting triangle formation, with resistance noted at $92,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

Following this breakout, Bitcoin's price continued to rise, peaking at $96,476. Currently, the price is consolidating above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, which is derived from the recent price movement from a low of $89,995 to the high of $96,476. The trading activity indicates that Bitcoin is positioned above the $95,000 mark and the 100 hourly Simple Moving Average, suggesting a continuation of the bullish trend if it remains stable above the $94,500 zone.

Immediate resistance levels are identified at $96,000, with the first key resistance at $96,500. Should Bitcoin close above the $96,800 resistance, there is a potential for further upward movement, possibly testing the $98,000 resistance level. Subsequent resistance could be found around $98,500, with further barriers at $99,000 and the psychological $100,000 mark.

However, the price action is not without risks. If Bitcoin fails to break above the $96,000 resistance, a decline could ensue. Immediate support is located near the $95,000 level, followed by more significant support at $94,500. Should the price drop further, the next major support level is around the $93,200 zone, coinciding with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent price wave. A decline below the $91,500 support could lead to accelerated losses.
