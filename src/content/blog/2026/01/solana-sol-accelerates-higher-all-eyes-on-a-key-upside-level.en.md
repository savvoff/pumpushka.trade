## Overview

Solana (SOL) has recently experienced a notable increase, moving above the $140 mark and establishing a consolidation phase. This upward trend is significant as it positions SOL for potential gains, particularly if it can surpass key resistance levels.

## Recent Price Movements

Solana initiated a fresh upward movement, surpassing both the $140 and $142 levels against the US Dollar. Following this trajectory, the price has settled above $140 and is currently trading above the 100-hourly simple moving average. A bullish trend line has formed with support positioned at $138 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. This trend line, along with the recent price movements, indicates a positive sentiment in the market.

The SOL price has shown strong performance, particularly against Bitcoin and Ethereum, after stabilizing above the $132 zone. The price climbed past the $138 mark, entering a short-term positive zone and successfully breaking through the $140 resistance. A peak was reached at $144, and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, calculated from the recent upward move that commenced from the $135 swing low to the $144 high.

While currently trading above $142, the price faces resistance near the $144 level, with the next major resistance point identified at $145. Should SOL close above the $150 resistance zone, it could pave the way for further upward movement, with a subsequent key resistance identified at $162.

## Potential Downside Correction

Despite the bullish momentum, there is a possibility of a downside correction if SOL fails to break above the $145 resistance. If this occurs, initial support can be found near the $142 zone, with significant support at the $140 level, which corresponds to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent price increase. A break below the $140 level may lead to a decline toward the $138 support zone and the trend line. If the price closes below the $138 support, it could further decline toward the $132 support level in the near term.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone, indicating positive market sentiment.
- **Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: The RSI for SOL/USD has risen above the 50 level, further supporting the bullish outlook.

The recent price movements of Solana highlight a strong bullish sentiment, especially as it outperforms major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The formation of a bullish trend line and the consolidation above key support levels suggest that traders are optimistic about SOL's potential for further gains. However, the looming resistance levels present a critical point for traders to watch closely, as any failure to breach these could lead to a correction.
