## Overview

Dogecoin has recently experienced a notable decline, falling below key support levels against the US Dollar. The cryptocurrency is currently consolidating its losses and may encounter resistance that could hinder any potential recovery.

## Recent Developments in Dogecoin Price

Dogecoin's price began a fresh downward trend, dropping below the $0.1320 zone. This decline follows a pattern seen with other major cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a result, Dogecoin has now moved below the $0.130 level, along with the 100-hourly simple moving average, indicating a bearish sentiment in the market.

The cryptocurrency's price has faced significant challenges, particularly after it closed below the $0.1350 mark. Following this, Dogecoin fell below both the $0.1300 and $0.1250 support levels, eventually trading below $0.120. A low was recorded near $0.1154, reinforcing bearish signs in the market.

Despite a brief recovery wave that saw the price rise above $0.1220, it remains below critical resistance levels. Dogecoin has cleared the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward move from a previous swing high to the recent low, yet it continues to struggle to regain momentum.

Currently, if Dogecoin manages to initiate a recovery wave, immediate resistance lies near the $0.130 level. The first significant resistance for buyers could be around the $0.1330 mark, coinciding with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward move. The next critical resistance point is near $0.1350, which is also where a bearish trend line is forming.

Should Dogecoin close above the $0.1350 resistance, it may pave the way for further gains, potentially sending the price towards the $0.1380 resistance and beyond, with targets extending to $0.140 and $0.1420.

Conversely, if the price fails to rise above the $0.1300 level, further declines are likely. The initial support on the downside is near the $0.1250 level, followed by the next significant support at $0.1220. The main support level sits at $0.120, and a breach below this could lead to further declines, possibly down to the $0.1150 or even $0.1135 levels.
