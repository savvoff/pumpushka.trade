## Overview

Bankinter, a prominent Spanish bank, has recently joined a significant investment round for the crypto exchange Bit2Me, contributing to a total funding of $35 million. This investment comes on the heels of Bit2Me receiving its MiCA license in 2025, indicating a growing trend of traditional financial institutions aligning with cryptocurrency platforms.

## Investment Round Details

In a notable development within the financial and cryptocurrency sectors, Bankinter has entered into a funding round alongside Tether and BBVA, bringing together established banking entities and a leading crypto exchange. The investment round totals $35 million, marking a substantial financial commitment to Bit2Me, which has been gaining traction in the rapidly evolving crypto market. 

The MiCA license, which Bit2Me obtained in 2025, is a significant regulatory achievement that allows the exchange to operate under the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets framework. This framework aims to provide a clear regulatory environment for crypto assets, enhancing investor protection and fostering innovation within the sector. The acquisition of this license underscores Bit2Me's commitment to compliance and its ambition to position itself as a leader in the European cryptocurrency landscape.

The collaboration between Bankinter, Tether, and BBVA reflects a broader trend where traditional banks are increasingly exploring partnerships with cryptocurrency platforms. Such alliances could potentially bridge the gap between conventional finance and the burgeoning crypto economy, enabling banks to offer more comprehensive services that include digital assets.
