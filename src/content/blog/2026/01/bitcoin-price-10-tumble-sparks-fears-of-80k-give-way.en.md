## Overview

Bitcoin has experienced a significant price decline, dropping nearly 10% and falling below the $86,500 level. This movement raises concerns about the potential for Bitcoin to test the crucial $80,000 support zone, which could have broader implications for market sentiment.

## Price Movement and Technical Analysis

In recent trading sessions, Bitcoin's price failed to maintain its position above the $86,500 threshold, resulting in a downward trend. The cryptocurrency is currently trading above $85,000 and is positioned above the 100-hourly simple moving average. However, a bearish trend line has formed with resistance identified at $83,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. 

As the price continued to decline, it fell below $87,200 and subsequently breached the $86,500 mark. The bearish momentum forced Bitcoin below $85,000, leading to further losses that drove the price down to a low of $81,000. This decline indicates that Bitcoin is exhibiting signals for additional downside movement.

Currently, Bitcoin is trading below the key resistance level of $83,200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average, which adds to the bearish sentiment. Should the price stabilize above $80,000, there is potential for a rebound. Immediate resistance is noted near the $82,000 level, while the first key resistance is at $83,200, which corresponds to the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward move from a high to the established low.

If Bitcoin closes above the $83,200 resistance, it may lead to further upward movement, potentially reaching the $85,000 resistance level. Additional gains could push the price towards the $85,700 mark or the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the same downward move. However, the immediate challenge remains at the $83,200 resistance zone. 

On the downside, if Bitcoin does not break above the resistance, it may face another decline. Immediate support is indicated at the $81,000 level, with major support following at around $80,500 and the critical $80,000 zone. A continued drop could see Bitcoin testing the $77,000 support in the near term, with the main support level positioned at $75,000. Falling below this level could significantly hinder Bitcoin's potential for recovery.

### Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD is currently gaining momentum in the bearish zone, suggesting a continuation of the downward trend.
- **Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: The RSI for BTC/USD is below the 50 level, reinforcing the bearish outlook.
