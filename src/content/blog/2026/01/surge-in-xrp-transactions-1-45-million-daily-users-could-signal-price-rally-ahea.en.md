## Overview

XRP has recently experienced a notable surge in daily transactions, reaching a six-month high. This increase in activity signifies a growing adoption of the cryptocurrency across payment systems and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. As XRP approaches a pivotal moment in its market presence, analysts are closely monitoring the implications of this trend.

## Surge in Daily Transactions

In January 2026, the XRP Ledger recorded an impressive 1.45 million daily transactions. This surge follows a consistent upward trend in network usage that began in late 2025. The rise in transactions coincided with the launch of new payment corridors through Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity platform and the integration of stablecoins like RLUSD. These developments are indicative of a broader acceptance and utilization of XRP within various financial systems.

## Gaps Between Demand and Price

Market expert Sam Daodu has pointed out that historical patterns often reveal a discrepancy between rising demand for XRP and stagnant prices. This gap can precede significant price rallies. Currently, exchange reserves are at eight-year lows, and there is an increase in institutional inflows linked to XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This situation suggests that XRP may be preparing for a substantial breakout, despite recent price fluctuations.

Although XRP experienced a slight rebound to $2.42 on January 6, marking a nearly two-month high, its price has since retraced to approximately $2.048. This decline occurred despite the surge in transactions, indicating that XRP has not yet fully capitalized on its increased usage. Daodu noted that such discrepancies between price and on-chain activity are not uncommon. 

## Factors Contributing to Price Delay

Several factors are contributing to the current delay in XRP's price reaction. One significant reason is market-wide consolidation, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum trading sideways in early 2026. This stagnant momentum has dampened the potential for altcoins like XRP to gain traction. Additionally, profit-taking pressure has emerged following XRP's rally in July 2025, where the token reached $3.65. Many short-term holders have cashed out, creating resistance levels within the $2.20 to $2.50 range.

Daodu suggests that until new catalysts emerge, XRP may remain confined to this range without experiencing a breakout. 

## Historical Context of Price Movements

Looking ahead, Daodu observes that XRP historically lags behind its on-chain progress before initiating explosive price moves. In previous years, such as 2017 and 2020, spikes in transaction volume and wallet activity often preceded significant price rallies. For example, in the third quarter of 2020, XRP's daily transactions increased by over 40% within two months, while the price remained flat at around $0.25. This was followed by a surge to over $0.70 within weeks in November. A similar trend was seen in late 2017, where increased usage metrics led to a jump in XRP's price from $0.30 to $3.30 by early January 2018. 

These historical precedents suggest that the current increase in on-chain transactions may indicate a forthcoming price breakout for XRP.

## From author

The recent rise in XRP transactions presents a compelling narrative of the cryptocurrency's growing adoption. The juxtaposition of increasing usage with stagnant prices raises questions about market dynamics and investor behavior. As analysts like Daodu highlight the historical precedents for delayed price reactions, it becomes essential for market participants to remain vigilant and informed about potential shifts in the landscape.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The surge in XRP transactions may indicate a broader trend of increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies in payment systems and DeFi applications.
- The gap between rising demand and stagnant prices could signal a potential rally for XRP, attracting more investor interest.
- Market conditions, including consolidation among major cryptocurrencies, may influence XRP's ability to break out of its current price range.
