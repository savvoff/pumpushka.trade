## Overview

Figure Technology, a company listed on Nasdaq, has announced the launch of an innovative blockchain platform designed for direct stock lending. This new on-chain equity system enables the issuance and lending of actual shares through blockchain infrastructure, marking a significant development in the intersection of finance and technology.

## What Happened

Figure Technology has introduced a blockchain-based platform that facilitates direct stock lending.
