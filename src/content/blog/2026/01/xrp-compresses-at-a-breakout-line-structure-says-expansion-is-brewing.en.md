## Overview

XRP is currently experiencing a period of compression at a pivotal breakout level, indicating that the market may be preparing for a significant movement. Although short-term volatility has diminished, the overall market structure remains positive, suggesting a potential expansion phase as XRP approaches vital resistance levels.

## XRP Compresses Into a Critical Decision Zone

According to a recent update from Egrag Crypto, the XRP 3-day chart is demonstrating robust bullish signals in the face of recent market consolidation. The price action is showing signs of compression within a descending channel as XRP nears a crucial decision zone between $2.30 and $2.40. This area is pivotal for determining the next direction for XRP's price movement.

From a technical perspective, several indicators suggest underlying market strength. The 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has started to flatten, which implies that selling pressure may be diminishing. Concurrently, the 200-period EMA is trending upward, reinforcing the notion that the broader macro trend remains bullish. Additionally, XRP's price is positioned above the EMA cluster, indicating that the market structure has not yet experienced a breakdown.

The significance of this setup is underscored by the proximity of the upper boundary of the descending channel to the previous breakout level of $2.30. A decisive close above $2.40 on the 3-day chart could confirm a breakout from this compression phase, potentially paving the way for further gains toward the $2.70 region, with the $3.13 level emerging as a potential higher target. Conversely, if XRP faces rejection at this resistance level, it could continue trading within a range. Nevertheless, as long as prices remain above the $2.00 mark, the overall bullish structure is maintained. This situation does not indicate a breakdown; rather, it exemplifies tightening price action that frequently precedes a significant expansion.

## Triple Tap Hits Range Highs

In a separate market update, CrediBULL Crypto highlighted that XRP has successfully executed a triple-tap move, reaching the upper boundary of its trading range. With liquidity at these range highs already addressed, the market finds itself at a critical juncture, offering two distinct potential paths for future price action.

The first scenario views the recent movement as merely a relief bounce, suggesting that XRP could sweep liquidity at the highs before resuming a local downtrend within the broader uptrend. If this scenario unfolds, prices could decline again, potentially falling below the $1.77 level.

Alternatively, the triple-tap pattern may signify the establishment of a strong base of structural demand. Under this interpretation, any pullbacks would likely attract buying interest, with the $1.77 lows viewed as a support zone instead of a level to breach. Considering the broader market context, particularly Bitcoin's position and overall market conditions, CrediBULL leans toward this second outcome, favoring long opportunities and anticipating that XRP will continue to expand higher, eventually targeting levels beyond the current range.

As traders and investors closely monitor these developments, the outcomes could have significant implications for XRP's trajectory.
