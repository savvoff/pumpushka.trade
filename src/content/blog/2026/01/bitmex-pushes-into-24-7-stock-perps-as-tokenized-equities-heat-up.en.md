## Overview

BitMEX is expanding its offerings by launching 24/7 Equity Perpetual Contracts (Perps) that allow traders to use cryptocurrency as collateral for gaining exposure to major US stocks and indexes. This move comes amid a growing trend among various exchanges, including Bitget and Kraken, to incorporate tokenized equities into their platforms.

This innovative product allows traders to access major US stocks and indexes around the clock, providing greater flexibility and opportunities for market engagement.

The decision to allow crypto as collateral for these equity contracts reflects an increasing convergence between the cryptocurrency market and traditional financial markets. By enabling crypto holders to participate in stock trading, BitMEX aims to attract a broader audience, particularly those who are already familiar with the crypto space.

## The Competitive Landscape

Competitors such as Bitget and Kraken are also exploring similar offerings, indicating a growing interest in bridging the gap between cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. This competition is likely to drive innovation and improve the overall user experience in the trading of both crypto and equity.

The ability to trade equities on a 24/7 basis represents a significant advancement over traditional stock markets, which generally operate during specific hours. This flexibility may attract traders who prefer the convenience of trading at any time, aligning with the needs of the increasingly global and digitally-oriented investor base.
