## Overview

The cryptocurrency Zcash experienced a significant decline following the announcement of a "constructive discharge" involving the Electric Coin Company (ECC) team. This decision was influenced by internal disagreements related to the future direction of the Zashi mobile wallet, which has raised concerns within the community.

## What Happened

The board of the Electric Coin Company issued a statement detailing that the discord among team members was primarily tied to recent proposals aimed at privatizing the Zashi mobile wallet. This development is notable as it signifies a shift in the operational dynamics of the ECC, the organization responsible for the development and support of the Zcash cryptocurrency.

The term "constructive discharge" suggests that the circumstances surrounding the team's departure were not merely voluntary but were influenced by the prevailing tensions and disagreements within the organization. The board's acknowledgment of these disagreements indicates a level of internal conflict that could have implications for the future of Zcash and its associated projects.

The Zashi mobile wallet is an integral component of the Zcash ecosystem, providing users with a platform to manage their Zcash holdings. The proposals to privatize this wallet could potentially alter its accessibility and functionality, which may concern existing users and investors. The community's reaction to these developments has been immediate, resulting in a notable plunge in Zcash's value.
