## Overview

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols are shifting away from traditional communication platforms like Discord, opting instead for ticketed help desks and live support systems. This change is primarily driven by an overwhelming number of scams that have plagued public channels, prompting a reevaluation of how DeFi projects interact with their communities.

## Shift from Discord to Ticketed Support

In recent months, several major DeFi protocols have begun to phase out their open Discord channels. The decision to move away from these always-on communication platforms comes as a response to the increasing prevalence of scams and fraudulent activities that have infiltrated these public spaces. As scams continue to compromise user security, DeFi projects are recognizing the need for a more controlled and secure environment for community interactions.

Ticketed help desks and live support options are emerging as viable alternatives. These systems allow users to submit inquiries or report issues in a more structured manner, reducing the risk of scams that can occur in open forums. By implementing these support systems, DeFi protocols aim to protect their users and enhance the overall experience within their communities.

## Importance of the Change

The transition from Discord to ticketed support mechanisms is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses the growing concern over user safety in the DeFi space. With the rise of scams, many users have expressed apprehension about engaging in open channels where malicious actors can easily exploit vulnerabilities. By moving to a more secure support environment, DeFi protocols can foster greater trust among their users.

Secondly, this shift highlights a broader trend within the DeFi ecosystem towards prioritizing user experience. As the industry matures, project teams are recognizing that effective communication and support are crucial components of user retention and satisfaction. Implementing ticketed help desks and live support can lead to more efficient problem resolution, allowing users to receive timely assistance when needed.

Lastly, this development reflects the evolving nature of community engagement in the DeFi space. As projects strive to create a safer and more supportive environment, the methods of communication and support are adapting to meet the needs of users. This evolution may set a precedent for future protocols and influence how they approach community interactions.

## From author

The move away from Discord channels to ticketed support systems marks a pivotal moment in the DeFi landscape. It is a direct response to the challenges posed by scams and the need for enhanced user security. As DeFi continues to grow, the ways in which projects communicate with their communities will likely continue to evolve, placing an emphasis on safety and user experience.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased user trust as DeFi protocols prioritize security and support.
- Potential reduction in scams, leading to a more positive community atmosphere.
- Shift in communication strategies may influence new projects entering the DeFi space.
- Enhanced user experience could lead to higher user retention rates.
- Evolution of community engagement methods may set industry standards for support systems.
