## Overview

Bitcoin traders have recently exhibited a bullish risk sentiment, evident in a notable advance driven by futures trading that brought the price to $95,000. The current focus is on whether bulls will make another attempt at a rally after retesting a significant underlying support level.

## Recent Developments

In the past week, Bitcoin experienced a futures-led advance that allowed it to reach $95,000. This upward movement reflects a shift in trader sentiment, indicating a growing confidence among Bitcoin investors. Futures trading can amplify market movements, leading to rapid price changes based on traders’ expectations and market dynamics. 

As the price approaches a critical support level, the question arises whether the bullish momentum will continue. Support levels are essential in technical analysis as they indicate price points where buying interest is strong enough to overcome selling pressure. A successful retest of a key support level can serve as a foundation for further price increases.

The implications of this bullish sentiment are significant. A sustained movement above the support level may encourage more traders to enter the market, potentially leading to a more robust rally. Conversely, if the support fails to hold, it could result in a downturn, impacting overall market confidence.
