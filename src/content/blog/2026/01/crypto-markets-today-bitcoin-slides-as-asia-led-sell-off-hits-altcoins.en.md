## Overview

Bitcoin experienced a decline during Asian trading hours, primarily due to its inability to surpass a significant price level. This downturn had a ripple effect, causing a broader sell-off across the crypto market, particularly impacting altcoins.

## Bitcoin's Struggles

Bitcoin faced a notable drop after it failed to break above a critical price level of $94,500. This resistance point proved to be a significant barrier for the leading cryptocurrency, triggering selling pressure among traders. The inability to maintain upward momentum led to a decrease in confidence, prompting many investors to liquidate their positions.

As Bitcoin struggled, the broader cryptocurrency market followed suit. The decline in Bitcoin's price typically sets the tone for other cryptocurrencies, and this instance was no exception. Altcoins, which often rely on Bitcoin's performance, saw a downturn as traders reacted to the leading asset's struggles. 

The impact of this sell-off was felt across various altcoins, as market sentiment shifted towards caution. Investors often view Bitcoin as a bellwether for the entire crypto market, and its inability to rally above the established resistance level led to increased selling activity among altcoin holders.
