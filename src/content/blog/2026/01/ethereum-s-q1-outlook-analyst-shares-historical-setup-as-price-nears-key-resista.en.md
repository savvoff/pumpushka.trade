## Overview

Ethereum is currently working to establish a crucial price level as support, with analysts expressing a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. Recent price movements suggest potential for a significant rally, with some anticipating that Ethereum could surpass the $4,000 mark in the first quarter of 2026.

## Recent Price Movements

On Monday, Ethereum broke through the $3,200 level for the first time in nearly a month, achieving a four-week high of $3,259. This increase represents an 8.3% surge from the critical $3,000 level, as Ethereum consolidated above the $3,100 mark over the weekend. The cryptocurrency, often referred to as the King of Altcoins, is now focused on maintaining this key resistance level and converting it into support.

This performance has drawn attention from market observers who are optimistic about a potential setup that could lead to a rally over the next three months. Analyst Niels noted that despite Ethereum's recent struggles, including a significant downturn in the fourth quarter, the current situation may present a favorable opportunity.

## Historical Context

Ethereum's fourth-quarter performance was notably weak, marking its worst Q4 in six years with a negative return. This downturn represents its first negative Q4 close since 2022 and its worst end-of-year performance since 2019. Despite this, Niels argues that this historical context could pave the way for a positive Q1. He pointed out that in previous instances where Ethereum finished Q4 in the red, Q1 has typically closed positively. He emphasized that year-end weakness often serves as a reset rather than a reversal.

## Technical Analysis and Future Expectations

Analyst Ted Pillows highlighted that Ethereum is approaching a critical resistance zone that has been in place for nearly two months. The cryptocurrency has been trading within a range of $2,700 to $3,400 since early November, with strong resistance at the $3,000 and $3,200 levels. If Ethereum can maintain its momentum and convert this upper boundary into support, it may be poised for a move toward the $3,800 to $4,000 range.

Additionally, analyst Ali Martinez pointed to a symmetrical triangle pattern forming on Ethereum's chart, indicating that the cryptocurrency has been compressing between the pattern's ascending and descending trendlines since November. A breakout from this upper boundary could propel Ethereum toward the $4,000 area in the coming weeks.

## From author

The current dynamics surrounding Ethereum's price indicate a potential turning point. Analysts are closely monitoring the cryptocurrency's ability to maintain its momentum and establish key support levels. The historical patterns observed in previous years suggest that weakness in Q4 could be an indicator of forthcoming strength in Q1. As Ethereum navigates this critical phase, market participants will be watching closely to see if it can break through significant resistance and maintain upward momentum.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Analysts are optimistic about Ethereum's potential for a rally, which could positively influence market sentiment.
- A successful breakout beyond the $4,000 level may lead to increased trading activity and interest in Ethereum.
- Historical patterns suggest that Q4 weakness could lead to stronger performance in Q1, potentially impacting overall market trends.
- If Ethereum can convert resistance levels into support, it may encourage bullish behavior among traders and investors.
- The formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern indicates a potential for volatility, which could attract speculative trading.
