## Overview

Ethereum's recent price action has sparked discussions about the potential formation of a short-term top. After struggling to surpass the $3,300 resistance level, Ethereum has begun a downside correction, indicating several bearish signs that could lead to further declines.

## Current Price Movement

Ethereum experienced a significant setback after failing to maintain momentum above the $3,300 threshold. Following this, the price dipped below critical levels, entering a short-term bearish phase. Specifically, Ethereum's value fell below $3,240 and $3,220, which are crucial support levels. The price is currently trading below $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, reflecting a weakening bullish sentiment.

A break below a crucial bullish trend line, which had support at $3,200, further emphasizes the bearish outlook. The trading pair has even dropped below $3,150, with a low recorded at $3,123. This decline has prompted a phase of consolidation, as the price tests the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent decline, which ranged from the $3,308 swing high to the $3,123 low.

At present, Ethereum is trading below $3,200, indicating a struggle to regain upward momentum. If the bulls can defend against further losses below the $3,120 mark, there is potential for another upward attempt. Immediate resistance is identified around the $3,180 level, with the first key resistance at $3,200. A move above this resistance could pave the way for challenges toward the $3,220 level, which corresponds to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent decline.

Should Ethereum manage to break through the $3,250 region, it may signal a more substantial rally in the coming days, potentially targeting the $3,300 resistance zone or even higher levels.

## Potential for Further Losses

If Ethereum fails to overcome the $3,220 resistance, it may initiate a fresh decline. The initial support level on the downside is positioned near $3,120, while a more significant support level lies at approximately $3,080. A decisive move below the $3,080 support threshold could lead to a further drop toward the $3,020 support level. Continued losses may push the price down to the $3,000 region.

- **Hourly RSI**: The RSI for ETH/USD is now situated below the 50 mark, indicating bearish momentum.

## From author

The current situation with Ethereum's price demonstrates the volatility and uncertainty that often characterizes cryptocurrency markets. As traders assess the potential for further declines or a rebound, the importance of key support and resistance levels cannot be overstated. The interplay of these technical indicators will play a crucial role in determining Ethereum's next moves.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Ethereum's inability to clear the $3,300 resistance may influence overall market sentiment, reflecting cautious trading behavior among investors.
- The bearish indicators could lead to increased selling pressure, potentially affecting other cryptocurrencies that often follow Ethereum's lead.
- A significant drop below critical support levels could trigger stop-loss orders, exacerbating downward movement in the market.
- Conversely, if Ethereum manages to regain momentum, it could bolster confidence in the broader cryptocurrency market, encouraging more buying activity. 
- The reactions to the ongoing price movements may set the tone for trading strategies in the near term, as market participants closely monitor Ethereum's performance.
