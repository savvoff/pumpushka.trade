## Overview

Solana has recently experienced a notable increase in its price, surpassing key resistance levels. The cryptocurrency is currently consolidating above $138, with potential for further gains if it breaks through the $142 resistance zone. This upward movement comes after a period of correction, and its implications could influence market dynamics.

## Recent Price Movement

Solana's price began a fresh upward trajectory after moving above the $136 zone. It is now trading above $138 and has surpassed the 100-hourly simple moving average. This movement indicates a positive shift in market sentiment for Solana, particularly as it has managed to outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum during this period.

The price initially corrected from a high near $144 but maintained stability above the $130 mark. After forming a low around $132, Solana began a renewed upward rally. It successfully climbed above the $135 level, entering a short-term positive zone, and surpassed the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downward movement from a swing high of $143 to a low of $132.

A significant technical milestone was reached with the break above a bearish trend line that featured resistance at $137 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Currently, Solana faces resistance near the $140 mark and the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level from the earlier downward move. The next major resistance level is situated around $142, with additional resistance anticipated at $145. A successful close above the $145 resistance could potentially pave the way for further increases, targeting the $150 level and beyond.

However, the price action is not without risks. If Solana fails to breach the $140 resistance, it may experience a decline. Initial support is identified near the $138 zone, with major support levels at $135 and $132. Should the price close below the $132 support, it could further decline toward the $124 level.

## Technical Indicators

The technical indicators for Solana show a bullish trend. The hourly MACD is gaining momentum within the bullish zone, suggesting a strengthening upward movement. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for SOL/USD remains above the 50 level, indicating that buying pressure is prevailing.
