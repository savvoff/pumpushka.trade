## Overview

MEXC, a crypto trading platform, has launched a promotional campaign centered around its peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace, featuring a $200,000 airdrop pool aimed at attracting new users. This limited-time offer invites individuals making their first deposit on the platform to participate, with specific eligibility requirements and conditions.

## Details of the Campaign

The promotional event commenced on January 4, 2026, at 11:00 UTC and is set to conclude on January 31, 2026, at 16:59 UTC. The campaign is exclusively available to accounts that have never made a deposit on MEXC before. Users can only qualify for the airdrop by completing deposits through the P2P channel, which distinguishes this offer from standard trading methods.

To participate, users must first register for the promotion via a dedicated event page. After registering, they can qualify by making their first P2P deposit, ensuring that the net deposited amount exceeds a specified threshold during the promotional period. It is crucial for participants to register before making a deposit; otherwise, they will not be counted towards the promotion.

Once registered and eligible, users who fulfill the deposit requirements within seven days will receive a fixed reward. The rewards are drawn from a shared pool of $200,000 and distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. This means that latecomers may miss out on rewards once the pool is fully claimed. After the campaign ends, eligible users will see their rewards credited directly to their Spot wallets, with distribution expected within 14 calendar days of the event's conclusion. Most participants are anticipated to receive their airdrop within five business days.

MEXC emphasizes its P2P trading service, enabling users to purchase cryptocurrencies using local currencies, various payment methods, and flexible pricing. Unlike traditional exchange transactions, P2P trades on MEXC incur no platform fees, a feature that the exchange highlights amid increasing competition in the P2P marketplace sector.

However, MEXC has implemented several restrictions for this promotion. Users who withdraw funds within 24 hours of meeting the deposit criteria will be disqualified from receiving any rewards. Additionally, those who have previously received rewards from other MEXC P2P promotions are ineligible for this campaign. Participation is limited to main accounts only, meaning sub-accounts cannot independently engage in this promotion. Any activities associated with sub-accounts will be consolidated under the primary account for eligibility assessments and reward distributions.

MEXC has also noted that it will conduct internal risk and compliance reviews before finalizing rewards. Attempts to manipulate the promotion, such as creating multiple accounts or providing false information, may lead to disqualification and forfeiture of rewards. Furthermore, the exchange reserves the right to adjust or terminate the campaign rules as necessary.

## From author

The launch of MEXC's promotional airdrop campaign illustrates a strategic effort to enhance user engagement and broaden its user base, particularly through the P2P trading service. By offering incentives for new users, MEXC aims to position itself competitively within the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. The focus on P2P transactions is particularly notable, as it caters to users who may face challenges with traditional fiat on-ramps, thereby expanding accessibility to cryptocurrency trading.

## Impact on the crypto market

- MEXC's airdrop campaign could stimulate increased participation in P2P trading, potentially leading to higher trading volumes on the platform.
- The zero-fee structure for P2P transactions may attract users from other exchanges, intensifying competition in the P2P marketplace.
- The campaign highlights the importance of user incentives in attracting new participants to cryptocurrency trading platforms.
- Restrictions and compliance measures underscore the exchange's commitment to maintaining a fair and secure trading environment, which may enhance user trust.
- The focus on localized payment options could enhance accessibility for users in regions with limited fiat on-ramps, fostering broader cryptocurrency adoption.
