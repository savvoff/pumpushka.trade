## Overview

Solana has recently experienced a notable increase in its price, surpassing the $130 mark and establishing a consolidation phase above $132. This upward momentum is significant as it may indicate a shift in market sentiment towards bullishness for the cryptocurrency.

## Price Movement and Technical Analysis

Solana's price began to rise after it established a position above the $125 level, which coincided with similar movements in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Following this, Solana's price climbed above the $130 level, entering what is characterized as a short-term positive zone. The upward trajectory continued as the price broke through the $132 resistance, with bullish activity pushing it above the $135 level.

Currently, Solana is trading above $135 and has crossed the 100-hourly simple moving average, suggesting a favorable technical posture. A bullish trend line is also forming, providing support at the $135 level on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. However, the price is encountering resistance near the $138 mark, with a further significant resistance point located around $140. 

Should Solana manage to surpass the $140 resistance, it may pave the way for additional gains, with the next notable resistance being at $145. A successful close above this level could potentially set the stage for a more sustained upward movement, targeting the $150 mark and beyond.

Conversely, if Solana fails to rise above the $185 resistance, it could trigger a decline. Initial support is positioned near the $134 zone and the trend line, while the first major support level is around $130. Should the price break below this level, it may lead to further declines towards the $128 support zone, with a close below $128 potentially indicating a drop towards the $120 support.

### Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone, reinforcing the current upward trend.
- **Hourly RSI**: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for SOL/USD is above the 50 level, indicating positive market sentiment.

### Major Support and Resistance Levels

- **Support Levels**: $135 and $130
- **Resistance Levels**: $138 and $140

## From author

The recent price movements of Solana reflect a positive trend, as the currency continues to show strength above critical support levels. The formation of a bullish trend line and the favorable positions of the MACD and RSI suggest that the market may be leaning towards further gains. However, traders should remain cautious of the resistance levels ahead, as they may influence future price action.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The upward movement in Solana's price may boost overall market sentiment for cryptocurrencies.
- Increased interest in Solana could lead to higher trading volumes, impacting liquidity.
- A potential breakout above resistance levels may encourage more investors to enter the market.
- If Solana continues to rise, it may influence other cryptocurrencies to follow suit, creating a broader bullish trend.
- Conversely, any decline below key support levels could lead to a more cautious market outlook, affecting investor confidence.
