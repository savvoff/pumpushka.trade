## Overview

Ripple is positioning itself to become a dominant player in the financial infrastructure space, akin to Amazon's influence in e-commerce, according to Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group. This strategic move involves a series of acquisitions aimed at integrating various financial services around XRP and Ripple's stablecoin RLUSD.

## Ripple's Acquisition Strategy

In the latter half of 2025, Ripple reportedly engaged in an aggressive acquisition strategy, spending approximately $2.45 billion. Claver suggests that this spending reflects a broader vision to create a comprehensive financial ecosystem that parallels Amazon's approach to building infrastructure. He emphasizes that the foundation of Amazon's success lay in its ownership of infrastructure rather than merely selling products. By owning the essential elements of financial services, Ripple aims to establish a vertically integrated system where XRP and RLUSD function as the core settlement layer.

Claver elaborates on the significance of this infrastructure approach, noting that it can lead to lower operational costs and enhance the efficiency of financial transactions. He believes that this vertical integration is uncommon in the financial services sector, where many firms tend to specialize in specific areas or rely on partnerships. Such fragmentation can lead to inefficiencies, delays, and complications when systems encounter issues.

## The Infrastructure Pillars

Claver outlines what he considers the essential components of a viable financial infrastructure for institutional use. He identifies several key elements that Ripple has been acquiring:

1. **Custody and Clearing Services**: These are vital for asset management and ensuring that trades are executed securely and efficiently.
  
2. **Treasury Management**: This is crucial for corporate operations, allowing companies to manage their finances effectively.
  
3. **Payment Rails**: Ripple emphasizes the importance of having global payment solutions that operate around the clock, facilitating seamless transactions.
  
4. **Stablecoin Infrastructure**: This is necessary for efficient settlements, allowing for quick and reliable financial transfers.
  
5. **Settlement Assets**: These assets are essential for moving value across the various layers of Ripple's integrated system.

Claver points to Ripple's recent acquisitions as building blocks for a comprehensive institutional product, branded “Ripple 1.” 

## Notable Acquisitions

Among the notable acquisitions in 2025:

- **Hidden Road**, purchased for $1.25 billion, has been rebranded as “Ripple Prime.” This acquisition is significant as it provides essential services for institutional trading, including clearing and custody.
  
- **Rail**, acquired for about $200 million, operates as a stablecoin payments platform, designed to facilitate transactions without the need for enterprises to hold crypto directly.
  
- **GTreasury**, acquired for $1 billion, offers treasury software that processes a substantial volume of payments, enhancing Ripple's access to corporate finance departments.
  
- **Palisade**, with undisclosed terms, is positioned as a wallet-as-a-service infrastructure, catering to high-velocity transaction needs.

## From author

The strategy employed by Ripple underlines a significant shift in how financial services can be structured, focusing on integration and infrastructure rather than merely transactional elements. This approach could redefine the competitive landscape in the financial sector, where efficiency and seamless operations are paramount. By establishing a robust ecosystem surrounding XRP and RLUSD, Ripple is attempting to create a self-sustaining network that could attract institutional clients.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Ripple's aggressive acquisition strategy may enhance its competitive edge in the financial services sector.
- The focus on infrastructure could lead to reduced transaction costs and improved efficiency for institutional clients.
- Increased adoption of Ripple's stablecoin RLUSD may create organic demand, benefiting the overall ecosystem.
- The establishment of a comprehensive product like “Ripple 1” could attract more institutional investments into the crypto space.
- Ripple's strategy may prompt other crypto firms to rethink their business models in favor of vertical integration.
