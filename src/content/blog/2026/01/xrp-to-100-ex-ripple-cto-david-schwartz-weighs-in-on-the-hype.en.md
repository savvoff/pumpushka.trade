## Overview

David Schwartz, the former Chief Technology Officer of Ripple, has voiced skepticism regarding optimistic predictions surrounding the price of XRP, particularly the notion of it reaching $100. Schwartz's comments delve into the current market dynamics, emphasizing the importance of rational investment beliefs and the economics of the XRP Ledger (XRPL).

## Schwartz's Perspective on XRP Price Predictions

In response to a user on the social media platform X, who urged him to caution XRP supporters against unrealistic price expectations, Schwartz articulated his concerns about the potential for XRP to reach $50 to $100. He refrained from making definitive statements about price but framed the discussion in probabilistic terms. Schwartz highlighted that if investors truly believed there was a significant chance of XRP reaching the $100 mark, the current market price would reflect that belief, suggesting that rational investors would not sell at low prices if they anticipated substantial future gains.

He noted that the current trading price of XRP being well below $10 indicates a lack of confidence among investors regarding its potential to reach $100 in the near term. Schwartz emphasized that the prevailing market conditions serve as a referendum on the credibility of such optimistic price forecasts.

## XRPL Economics and Transaction Throughput

Beyond price predictions, Schwartz also addressed the economic implications of XRP's pricing on its utility for payments and exchanges. He explained that a lower price for XRP could lead to higher costs for users, as more units of XRP would be required to represent the same value in transactions. This mechanical aspect of pricing potentially impacts how XRP is utilized across various payment and exchange flows.

Furthermore, Schwartz discussed the throughput capabilities of the XRPL, responding to inquiries about the theoretical maximum of 1,500 transactions per second (TPS). While he acknowledged that increasing TPS is feasible, he cautioned that most methods to achieve this would shift additional costs onto node operators. Schwartz pointed out that rising operational costs could pressure decentralization, as node operators may struggle to maintain efficiency without proportional benefits.

Instead of focusing solely on increasing transaction volume, Schwartz proposed a different optimization strategy: enhancing the value of each transaction. He noted that with current low fees on the XRPL, many transactions lack significant value, suggesting that there is an opportunity to prioritize more valuable transactions and reduce the prevalence of low-value interactions.

## From author

Schwartz's insights reflect a deep understanding of the complexities involved in cryptocurrency markets, particularly regarding investor psychology and the economic mechanics of blockchain technology. His analysis underscores the need for a rational approach to investing in crypto assets, particularly in an environment often dominated by hype and speculation.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Schwartz's skepticism about XRP price predictions may influence investor sentiment and caution against speculative buying.
- The discussion around XRPL's economic implications could lead to a reevaluation of how XRP is utilized in real-world applications.
- Concerns about transaction throughput and node operator costs may prompt further exploration of scalability solutions within the XRPL community.
- Schwartz's emphasis on rational investment beliefs could contribute to a more grounded approach to cryptocurrency valuation, potentially stabilizing market fluctuations.
- The ongoing dialogue about the balance between transaction volume and value may shape future developments in blockchain technology and its applications.
