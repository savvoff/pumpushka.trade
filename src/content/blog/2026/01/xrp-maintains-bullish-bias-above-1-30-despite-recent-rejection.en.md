## Overview

XRP continues to exhibit underlying strength, maintaining a bullish bias above the crucial $1.30 level, despite facing recent rejections near its highs. The price action indicates that the latest pullback may be a temporary consolidation rather than the onset of a deeper market reversal.

## XRP's Current Market Position

Recent analyses highlight XRP's position above a confirmed multi-year breakout zone on higher-timeframe charts. This follows a prolonged accumulation phase, which has set the stage for potential future price expansions. After a significant upward movement, XRP's current price action appears to be constructing a framework for the next potential leg upward.

From a technical standpoint, XRP has successfully broken out of a descending wedge pattern that developed between 2020 and 2024. This breakout has been substantial, with a rally observed from a lower price level, reinforcing the overall bullish trend and confirming a shift in the long-term market structure.

At present, XRP is respecting a critical fair value gap and accumulation zone between $1.90 and $1.30. This zone continues to serve as a vital demand region. As long as XRP remains above the $1.30 mark, the higher-timeframe bullish structure remains intact, and the broader upside thesis is upheld.

While there are ambitious upside targets projected for XRP in the long term, these are not specified in this analysis. However, the bullish outlook could be compromised if XRP closes below the $1.30 level on higher timeframes, which would indicate a breakdown in market structure and a shift in bias.

## Trendline Structure and Market Dynamics

Despite a recent rejection near the psychological level of $2.37, the broader trendline structure for XRP remains unbroken. The recent price action shows that, although momentum indicators exhibited initial weakness, the price reaction did not lead to a confirmed breakdown of the overall market structure.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) displayed a decline ahead of the price, coinciding with XRP losing its range Point of Control (POC). This sequence triggered a sharp pullback; however, it is important to note that the move did not reflect a clear structural failure. Instead, it suggests that the decline is corrective rather than indicative of a trend-ending scenario.

During a recent market downturn led by Ethereum, XRP experienced a sell-off but managed to rebound quickly, outperforming many Ethereum-related assets. This behavior indicates a rotation of capital into assets demonstrating relative strength, rather than a widespread distribution throughout the market.

Looking forward, the market bias for XRP remains constructive as long as the trendline holds. If the price can reclaim levels above the range POC, the bullish outlook may be further solidified. Conversely, sustained acceptance below this area could invalidate the bullish setup, shifting focus to lower price levels.
