## Overview

The global cryptocurrency market has experienced a notable increase, with a market cap reaching $3.16 trillion. Major cryptocurrencies are trading higher, reflecting a positive sentiment in the market. This increase is underscored by significant movements in both established and emerging tokens, alongside developments in regulatory and institutional engagement.

## Market Movement

As of the latest reports, the cryptocurrency market cap has risen by 1.5%, reaching $3.16 trillion. Major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Solana have shown positive trading patterns. Specifically, Bitcoin has increased by 2% to $93,000, while Ethereum has risen by 1% to $3,175. Binance Coin has seen a more substantial increase of 2.5%, trading at $906, and Solana has climbed by 1% to $135.

In addition to these major cryptocurrencies, several other tokens have demonstrated impressive performance. Virtuals have surged by 24%, while Render and BitTorrent have each increased by 17% and 11%, respectively. Furthermore, Fetch.ai has also seen an 11% rise, showcasing the diverse growth within the crypto sector.

A significant development contributing to this positive market atmosphere is the substantial net inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On the first trading day of 2026, Bitcoin ETFs recorded $471 million in net inflows, marking the highest single-day total since November of the previous year. This influx of capital into Bitcoin ETFs signifies growing institutional interest and confidence in the cryptocurrency market.

Another noteworthy event in the regulatory landscape is the departure of SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, who officially left the agency on January 2nd. Her exit leaves behind an all-Republican commission, which may influence future regulatory decisions regarding cryptocurrencies.

In the corporate arena, the Big Four firm PwC has announced plans to deepen its involvement in the cryptocurrency sector, with a specific focus on stablecoins and payment solutions. This move by a major consultancy firm indicates a growing recognition of the importance of cryptocurrencies in the broader financial ecosystem.
