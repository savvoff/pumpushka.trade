## Overview

Cardano (ADA) appears to be approaching the conclusion of a lengthy corrective phase, which has drawn parallels to its 2020 market behavior. A recent analysis by crypto analyst Quantum Ascend suggests that this corrective phase could set the stage for future price increases, similar to past patterns observed in Cardano's performance.

## Technical Analysis Insights

In a recent video, Quantum Ascend examined Cardano's weekly chart, framing it within a macro, multi-leg corrective structure. The analysis suggests that Cardano is currently navigating through an A, B, C, D, and is awaiting an E phase. This sequence indicates that the market is in the late stages of broader consolidation rather than entering a new downtrend. The E phase is particularly significant as it represents the final stage of a wedge-like compression.

Quantum Ascend emphasized the importance of an upper trendline and Fibonacci levels to substantiate potential upside targets once this market structure has been completed. The analyst noted that historical patterns indicate significant price movements following such consolidations. 

To reinforce his argument, Quantum Ascend compared the current corrective phase to a previous one in 2020. He highlighted a historical “fractal” that illustrates comparable price behaviors, noting how past corrections have mirrored the present situation. The analyst suggested that the market’s previous correction forced ADA to establish a lower trendline, setting the stage for potential future growth.

## Indicators and Market Sentiment

Quantum Ascend pointed out several indicators suggesting a potential shift in momentum for Cardano. He noted early signs of a weekly momentum shift, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) beginning to rise after a prolonged period of low values. The analyst observed that negative momentum has been decreasing, with a structure on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicating a similar turning narrative. 

He stated that significant market moves often occur when the weekly RSI transitions from low to high, implying that higher timeframes may offer more reliable signals for traders and investors. Despite not holding a position in Cardano at present, Quantum Ascend expressed confidence in the project’s future potential.

## From Author

The analysis serves as a reminder of how past market behaviors can inform present expectations, especially in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. It is crucial for investors to remain vigilant and consider both macro and micro trends when evaluating their strategies in the crypto market.
