## Overview

Solayer has announced the launch of a $35 million fund, aimed at supporting on-chain applications that focus on real-time decentralized finance (DeFi), artificial intelligence (AI), and tokenization. This initiative is backed by both Solayer Labs and the Solayer Foundation, highlighting a commitment to fostering innovation in the blockchain space.

## What Happened

The newly established fund is designed to target on-chain applications that demonstrate significant revenue potential and high usage rates. By concentrating on these areas, Solayer aims to encourage the development of applications that not only leverage blockchain technology but also provide tangible benefits to users and stakeholders.

The focus on real-time DeFi applications is particularly noteworthy, as this area has garnered substantial attention within the cryptocurrency community. DeFi represents a shift away from traditional financial systems, allowing users to engage in financial transactions directly on the blockchain without intermediaries. This fund seeks to enhance the capabilities of DeFi applications, making them more efficient and accessible.

In addition to DeFi, the emphasis on AI applications suggests a recognition of the growing intersection between artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. By supporting projects that integrate AI, Solayer is positioning itself at the forefront of a technological evolution that could redefine how data is processed and utilized within the crypto ecosystem.

Tokenization is another critical focus of the fund. This aspect entails converting physical or digital assets into tokens that can be traded on a blockchain. Tokenization has the potential to revolutionize various industries by increasing liquidity and enabling fractional ownership.

The backing from both Solayer Labs and the Solayer Foundation indicates a strong organizational commitment to this initiative. This dual support is likely to enhance the fund's credibility and attract high-quality projects looking for financial assistance and mentorship.

This strategic focus could lead to the development of innovative solutions that address current market needs, ultimately benefiting users and investors alike.
