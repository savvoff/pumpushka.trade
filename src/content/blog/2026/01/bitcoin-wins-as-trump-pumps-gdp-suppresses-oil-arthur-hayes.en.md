## Overview

Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, argues that the U.S. strategy to gain control over Venezuelan oil is driven more by electoral considerations than geopolitical concerns. He believes that this approach, which aims to stimulate nominal economic growth while keeping energy costs low, is favorable for Bitcoin and high-beta cryptocurrencies.

## Analysis of the Situation

In his recent essay titled "Suavemente," Hayes presents a perspective on U.S. political dynamics, suggesting that politicians prioritize re-election while the average voter seeks economic stability. He questions the impact of U.S. involvement in Venezuela on the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin. Hayes emphasizes that the key factor influencing voter sentiment is the economy, especially concerning inflation in essential areas like food and energy.

Hayes outlines a critical observation regarding gasoline prices, asserting that they serve as a daily indicator of economic management for Americans. He notes that U.S. politicians can enhance nominal GDP through credit expansion, a tactic he associates with the policies of former President Trump. However, he cautions that rising inflation, particularly in gasoline prices, can have adverse effects. He introduces what he calls the "10% rule," which suggests that a significant increase in national gasoline prices in the run-up to elections can shift political control.

This situation creates two potential market regimes: one where nominal GDP and credit rise alongside oil prices, and another where they increase while oil prices remain stable or decline. Hayes argues that Bitcoin stands to benefit if oil prices are contained, as the price of oil influences the sustainability of monetary expansion rather than the mechanics of Bitcoin itself.

He elaborates on the relationship between energy costs and Bitcoin mining, stating that Bitcoin represents the most abstract form of money. Consequently, fluctuations in energy prices impact all miners uniformly, meaning that the price of oil is only relevant in terms of its effect on political decisions regarding monetary policy.

Hayes identifies macroeconomic indicators, such as the 10-year Treasury yield and the MOVE Index (which measures bond-market volatility), as stress signals for the market. He warns that if oil prices rise significantly, they could lead to increased yields and volatility, prompting policymakers to alter their strategies. He references a previous incident involving tariffs during Trump's administration, where market volatility led to a policy reversal, suggesting that similar dynamics could play out in the current scenario.

In the absence of such stress, Hayes anticipates aggressive credit expansion with oil prices either stabilizing or falling, which he believes would drive Bitcoin's value higher. He connects the expansion of dollar liquidity to Bitcoin's price trajectory, arguing that as more dollars enter the market, the prices of Bitcoin and certain cryptocurrencies will surge.

## From author

Hayes' analysis presents a compelling argument about the intertwined nature of U.S. economic policy and the cryptocurrency market. His emphasis on the influence of political dynamics on economic conditions highlights the complexity of market reactions to external events. Understanding these relationships is crucial for investors and market participants as they navigate the volatile landscape influenced by both macroeconomic factors and political strategies.

## Impact on the crypto market

- U.S. control over Venezuelan oil may lead to policies that support economic growth, positively impacting cryptocurrency values.
- The relationship between gasoline prices and voter sentiment could influence monetary policy, affecting the overall market for Bitcoin and other digital assets.
- A stable or declining oil price environment could enhance Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against inflation and a store of value.
- Increased dollar liquidity may create upward pressure on Bitcoin prices, as suggested by Hayes’ observations.
- Market volatility, particularly driven by oil price fluctuations, could prompt significant shifts in investor behavior and sentiment towards cryptocurrencies.
