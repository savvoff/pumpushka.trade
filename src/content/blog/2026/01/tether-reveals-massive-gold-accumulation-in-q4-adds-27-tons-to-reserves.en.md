## Overview

Tether, the issuer of the leading stablecoin USDT, has announced a significant increase in its gold reserves, reflecting a trend towards hard assets amidst volatility in both cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets. This move highlights Tether's commitment to gold-backed stablecoins as a stable investment option.

## Tether's Gold Accumulation

In the fourth quarter of 2025, Tether disclosed a substantial expansion of its gold holdings. This accumulation is noteworthy particularly as gold prices reached unprecedented levels, crossing the $5,000 per ounce mark for the first time. The surge in gold prices was driven by a heightened demand for safe-haven assets, amid rising geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty.

Tether's attestation report revealed that the company's gold-backed stablecoins, known as XAU₮, have experienced rapid growth throughout the year. The total market capitalization of gold-backed stablecoins surged from approximately $1.3 billion to over $4 billion. Tether Gold has emerged as a leading issuer in this market, controlling around 60% of the total supply of gold-backed stablecoins in circulation.

By the end of the fourth quarter, Tether's total physical gold reserves were reported to be 520,089.350 fine troy ounces, with each XAU₮ token backed on a one-to-one basis by a fine troy ounce of physical gold. At current gold prices, the estimated market value of these holdings is around $2.25 billion.

## Tether's Position in the Global Gold Market

Tether's growing gold reserves have positioned the company among the top global holders of gold. According to data from the International Monetary Fund and a Jefferies report from late 2025, Tether ranks within the top 30 gold holders worldwide, surpassing the gold reserves of several countries, including Greece, Qatar, and Australia.

During just the fourth quarter of 2025, Tether Gold Investments added approximately 27 metric tons of gold to its portfolio. This significant accumulation underscores Tether's strategic approach to enhancing its asset backing, especially in times of economic uncertainty.

Tether has confirmed that all gold reserves are securely stored in Switzerland, adhering to the London Good Delivery standards set by the London Bullion Market Association, a recognized benchmark for institutional gold custody. This compliance reinforces Tether's credibility and reliability in the gold market.

## From author

Tether's recent actions reflect a broader trend in the financial landscape where the demand for tangible assets like gold is increasing.
