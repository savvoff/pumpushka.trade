## Overview

Ethereum has recently experienced a significant decline in price, dropping after failing to surpass a key resistance level. Currently, the price is struggling to maintain its position above a critical support area, which has raised concerns among traders and investors.

## Price Decline and Support Levels

Ethereum price started a major decline after it was unable to clear the $3,050 resistance level. Following this failure, ETH has seen a decrease of 10%, with the price now hovering near the $2,700 support level. The decline began when Ethereum could not maintain stability above $2,880, which led to a fresh downturn. The current trading price is below $2,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, indicating a bearish trend.

A steep bearish trend line is forming with resistance positioned at $2,820 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The price has dipped below $2,750, reaching a low of $2,680. At this point, it is showing signs of weakness, trading below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent decline from a swing high of $3,040 down to the low of $2,680.

For Ethereum to initiate a recovery, it needs to stay above the $2,700 zone. Immediate resistance is noted around the $2,765 level, while the first key resistance is near $2,820, coinciding with the bearish trend line. The next significant resistance level is around $2,860, which aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent decline.

If Ethereum manages to break above the $2,860 resistance, it could potentially move towards the $2,900 resistance level. A further upward movement beyond this point might indicate a chance for gains towards the $3,000 resistance zone or even toward the $3,050 level.

## Potential for Further Losses

Conversely, if Ethereum fails to overcome the $2,820 resistance, it may trigger another round of declines. The initial support on the downside is located near the $2,700 level, while the first major support area is near $2,680. A clear move below this support could lead to a decline towards the $2,620 support level. Further losses could push the price down to the $2,550 region, with the main support potentially resting at $2,500.

### Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.
- **Hourly RSI**: The RSI for ETH/USD is currently below the 50 zone.
