## Overview

In the latest developments within the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin has experienced a decline, falling below a notable threshold. Meanwhile, altcoins such as Solana, XRP, and Cardano have reported weekly losses, contributing to the cautious sentiment among investors.

## Market Movements

On Tuesday, the cryptocurrency market exhibited a steadier performance compared to the previous day's fluctuations, which were influenced by tariff-related concerns. Despite this slight stabilization, the overall sentiment in the market remains cautious. Altcoins continue to show weaker performance relative to Bitcoin, indicating a potential shift in investor confidence. 

The decline of Bitcoin below the $91,000 mark has raised eyebrows among market participants, as it suggests a shift in the dynamics of trading and investment strategies. The pressure on altcoins is evident as they struggle to maintain momentum, reflecting a broader trend of investor sentiment tilting towards caution.

The performance of altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Cardano is particularly noteworthy. These cryptocurrencies have been nursing losses throughout the week, which may indicate underlying issues or market reactions to broader economic factors. The weaker performance of altcoins compared to Bitcoin suggests that investors may be favoring Bitcoin as a safer asset during uncertain market conditions.
