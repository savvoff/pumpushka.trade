## Overview

Ethereum is experiencing downward pressure in its trading activity, unable to maintain levels above $3,000. This situation reflects a shift in trader sentiment across the derivatives markets, as funding rates trend toward negative territory, indicating a growing preference for short positions.

## Current Market Dynamics

As of the latest data, Ethereum is trading at approximately $2,925, marking a decline of 2.7% within the day. This price movement has been confined within a 24-hour range, peaking at about $3,012.99 and dipping to lows around $2,909.60. The inability to sustain a price above the $3,000 threshold has significant implications for trader psychology, particularly as this level has proven to be a consistent resistance point.

Traders have faced challenges in maintaining momentum after a previous rejection at around $3,360 on January 18. The subsequent move toward the high-$2,900s reflects a market dominated by sellers. Despite this orderly pullback, the derivatives market is showing signs of weakening momentum, particularly evident in Ethereum's open interest-weighted funding rates, which are nearing negative territory.

### Funding Rates and Market Sentiment

The funding rates for Ethereum are a critical indicator of market sentiment. Currently, the OI-weighted funding rate for Ethereum is approximately 0.0008%, a notable decrease from earlier readings of about 0.009%. When funding rates dip into negative territory, it typically signals that short positions are paying longs, suggesting a rising demand for bearish exposure among traders.

The funding spikes that previously accompanied earlier price rebounds have diminished, indicating that bearish positioning is increasingly dominating the market landscape. This shift is crucial as it highlights a change in trader sentiment, moving toward a more defensive posture.

## Open Interest and Liquidations

Despite the downward price movement, Ethereum's derivatives market remains active, with total open interest remaining high. Data indicates that Ethereum's aggregate open interest has risen by 0.68% in the past 24 hours, now sitting at approximately 13.36 million ETH, which translates to around $39.19 billion. This suggests that many traders have opted to stay in the market rather than exiting entirely.

Looking at major exchanges, Binance holds the largest share of Ethereum open interest, valued at around $8.95 billion, although it has seen a slight decline of 0.8% in the past 24 hours. In contrast, CME has reported an increase of 3.72% in open interest, bringing its total to about $5.73 billion. Other exchanges, such as Gate and MEXC, also contribute to the overall open interest figures.

Over the past day, liquidations for Ethereum reached a total of $64.34 million, with long positions accounting for the majority of these losses, totaling approximately $52.52 million. The market's ability to hold above the $2,900 mark could allow for a normalization of funding rates, potentially facilitating another attempt to approach the $3,000 level.

## From author

The recent trends in Ethereum's market activity highlight the complex dynamics at play within the derivatives sector. The shift toward negative funding rates and the persistence of high open interest reveal a cautious approach among traders as they navigate the current market conditions. The interplay between bearish sentiment and the potential for recovery will be pivotal in shaping Ethereum's price movements in the near future.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Ethereum's inability to hold above $3,000 reflects broader trader sentiment and psychological resistance levels.
- The movement toward negative funding rates indicates a growing preference for bearish positions among traders.
- High open interest suggests that traders are maintaining their positions, indicating ongoing interest in Ethereum despite current price pressures.
- Liquidation trends highlight the risks associated with long positions in the current market environment.
- The potential for a rebound hinges on maintaining support above $2,900, which could stabilize funding rates and restore bullish sentiment.
