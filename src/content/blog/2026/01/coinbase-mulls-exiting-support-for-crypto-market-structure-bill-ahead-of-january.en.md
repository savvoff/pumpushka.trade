## Overview

As the January 15 markup of the crypto market structure bill, known as the CLARITY Act, approaches, Coinbase is reportedly reconsidering its support for the legislation. This potential shift is tied to the bill's provisions regarding stablecoin rewards, which are vital to Coinbase's business model.

## Coinbase's Position on the CLARITY Act

Recent reports indicate that Coinbase's support for the CLARITY Act may be contingent on the inclusion of provisions that extend beyond enhanced disclosure requirements associated with stablecoin rewards. The bill is slated for markup in at least one Senate committee, and Coinbase's potential withdrawal could have far-reaching implications for the legislation. A source familiar with Coinbase's position indicated that the exchange would reassess its support if the bill diverges significantly from its interests, particularly concerning stablecoin incentives.

The stakes for Coinbase are high. The exchange currently allows users to earn rewards on their stablecoin holdings, which forms a crucial part of its business strategy. Any restrictions on these rewards could adversely affect user engagement on the platform. Reports suggest that the proposed bill might limit the ability of exchanges to offer rewards, a concern that resonates with the banking sector, which fears a loss of deposits to crypto platforms.

## The Implications of Reward Restrictions

Coinbase holds applications for a national trust charter, which would enable it to offer rewards under specific regulatory frameworks. The exchange currently provides rewards of 3.5% on Circle's USDC holdings. If the market structure bill includes provisions that ban such incentives, it may lead to a decrease in the number of users opting to hold stablecoins on Coinbase. This shift could jeopardize anticipated revenue streams, with projections indicating a potential $1.3 billion in revenue by 2025.

The GENIUS Act, which became law in July of the previous year, already prohibits stablecoin issuers from offering interest on token holdings. However, it does not prevent exchanges like Coinbase from providing rewards based on customer balances. The banking industry has raised concerns that allowing exchanges to offer rewards could displace significant amounts of deposits, potentially harming community lending and local businesses.

In contrast, Coinbase's chief policy officer has argued that maintaining rewards tied to stablecoins is essential for preserving the dollar's dominance, especially in light of competing initiatives from other countries, such as China's digital yuan offering interest.

## Potential Compromises and Industry Reactions

A potential compromise under discussion would limit the ability to provide rewards strictly to licensed banking entities and financial institutions. This proposal has sparked opposition from the crypto sector, which is concerned about the competitive implications of such restrictions. Recently, several crypto firms, including Ripple, Circle, and Paxos, received conditional approvals from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to become national trust banks, further complicating the landscape.

If restrictions are enforced, the crypto industry may need to explore alternative methods to reward customers creatively, in response to the changing regulatory environment.

## From Author

As the landscape evolves, the implications for both the banking sector and crypto firms will be significant.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- Coinbase's reconsideration of its support for the CLARITY Act could lead to increased volatility in the crypto market as stakeholders react to potential regulatory changes.
- Restrictions on stablecoin rewards may prompt users to seek alternative platforms or methods for earning incentives, impacting user engagement on major exchanges.
- The outcome of the CLARITY Act markup could set a precedent for how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the United States, influencing future legislation and compliance requirements.
