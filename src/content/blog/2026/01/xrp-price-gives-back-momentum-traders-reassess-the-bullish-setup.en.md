## Overview

XRP has recently experienced a downturn after failing to maintain momentum above the $2.20 mark. As the price corrects its gains, traders are closely monitoring key support and resistance levels, particularly around the $2.080 zone.

## Recent Price Action

XRP price has initiated a downside correction following its inability to surpass the $2.20 threshold. Currently, the price is facing challenges in maintaining levels above $2.080 and has dipped below the $2.120 mark, as well as the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. This decline has placed XRP in a vulnerable position, underperforming against major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The price action has seen XRP test the $2.080 zone, where bulls are attempting to establish a foothold. A bullish trend line is forming, indicating potential support at this level on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. A significant resistance level appears at $2.120, and if XRP manages to clear this barrier, it could pave the way for further upward movement. The next notable resistance level is around $2.150, and surpassing this could lead XRP to test the $2.20 mark again.

XRP's recent performance has also shown a decline below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of its prior upward move, which extended from a swing low of $2.032 to a high of $2.193. This indicates that the bulls are currently under pressure, and the price may face additional challenges if it fails to regain momentum.

## Technical Analysis

If XRP cannot break through the $2.120 resistance zone, it risks entering a fresh decline. Initial support is observed at the $2.080 level, with a subsequent major support level near $2.070, which coincides with the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level from the previous upward movement. Should the price close below $2.070, there is potential for a further decline towards the $2.050 area. The next critical support level is identified at around $2.020, which, if breached, could lead to a continued downward trend toward the $2.00 mark.

### Technical Indicators
- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for XRP/USD is currently gaining momentum in the bearish zone.
- **Hourly RSI**: The Relative Strength Index for XRP/USD is positioned below the 50 level.
- **Major Support Levels**: $2.080 and $2.050.
