## Overview

The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant sell-off, primarily influenced by ongoing tariff controversies linked to former President Trump. Major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, saw notable declines, while some smaller tokens managed to gain traction. This volatility highlights the ongoing challenges and dynamics within the crypto market.

## Market Performance

In the wake of Trump's tariff turmoil, major cryptocurrencies faced declines. Bitcoin experienced a decrease of 2%, settling at a price of $91,100. Ethereum followed closely, dropping by 4% to $3,105. Solana and XRP also saw reductions, with Solana down 3% at $129 and XRP decreasing by 2% to $1.93. This downturn in major cryptocurrencies reflects the broader sentiment in the market, which is sensitive to geopolitical events and economic policies.

Conversely, certain tokens experienced gains amid the overall market weakness. CC led the top movers with a significant increase of 12%, followed by MYX with a 5% rise and SYRUP, which gained 4%. These movements indicate that while the larger market struggled, some assets found opportunities for growth.

In the corporate sector, Steak ’n Shake disclosed its exposure to Bitcoin, revealing a rough estimate of $10 million, alongside its intentions to establish a corporate Bitcoin strategic reserve. This move signifies a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional businesses, suggesting a potential shift in corporate treasury strategies.

Additionally, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is preparing for 24/7 trading of tokenized stocks and ETFs. This development is noteworthy as it could enhance liquidity and accessibility in the cryptocurrency market, appealing to a broader range of investors.

In governance discussions, Vitalik Buterin emphasized the need for more sophisticated decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance models. He highlighted the importance of improving accountability, coordination, and long-term sustainability within these organizations, which are crucial for the future of decentralized finance.

Bermuda is also making strides towards a fully on-chain national economy, collaborating with Coinbase and Circle on developments related to payments, identity, and tokenized financial infrastructure. This initiative could set a precedent for other nations considering similar technological advancements.

In the realm of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Bitcoin ETFs faced net outflows of $394 million on Friday, breaking a four-day inflow streak. In contrast, Ethereum ETFs recorded positive inflows of $4.7 million, indicating a divergence in investor sentiment between the two leading cryptocurrencies.

The meme coin sector mirrored the overall market's downward trend, with notable declines in various tokens. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and others experienced reductions, while on-chain movers like USOR, GSD, and Eliza Town showed remarkable increases, highlighting the diverse nature of the crypto ecosystem.
