## Overview

Recently, the Shiba Inu price experienced a notable increase of over 13%, marking a departure from a prolonged bear trend that had constrained its performance. This price movement is part of a larger trend observed in 2026, where meme coins, including Shiba Inu, are capitalizing on a broader positive shift in the crypto market and rising demand.

## Key Drivers Behind The Shiba Inu Price Rally

On January 4, Shiba Inu surged more than 13% amidst an unexpected meme coin frenzy in 2026. This rise was highlighted by significant capital rotation among speculative assets. According to data from Santiment, a crypto analytics platform, the recent price surge was primarily driven by aggressive accumulation from large holders, known as whales, rather than an increase in retail demand.

Santiment analysts noted that top holders were consolidating their grip on Shiba Inu's supply, indicating a lack of retail distribution during this period. This accumulation suggests increasing confidence among the dominant whale wallets, pointing out that the rally was not merely a result of short-term hype-driven buying.

The price movement for Shiba Inu began at the start of January after several weeks of consolidation near recent lows. The recent bounce followed a prolonged downtrend that lasted from late October through December 2025, making the 13% increase a significant shift in momentum.

The analysis from Santiment also highlighted a rising trend in the percentage of Shiba Inu supply held by the top 10 whale wallets. Despite price fluctuations throughout the latter half of 2025, this metric showed a steady increase, indicating ongoing accumulation even amid weak broader market conditions. At the time of the analysis, the 10 largest Shiba Inu wallets collectively controlled about 62.65% of the total supply, a high concentration that grants these large holders considerable influence over short-term price movements.

The largest wallet alone held approximately 41% of the total Shiba Inu supply, valued at around $3.3 billion. Other top whale wallets controlled between 2.8% and 5.7% of the total supply, with several individual addresses valued in the hundreds of millions. The timing of Shiba Inu's price jump coincided with a notable increase in whale concentration, as more supply became locked up. This reduction in available liquidity allowed for modest buying pressure to drive prices significantly higher.

## From author

The recent surge in Shiba Inu's price illustrates the impact of whale behavior on market dynamics. As large holders accumulate and restrict supply, they can significantly influence price movements, especially in a market characterized by speculative trading. The concentration of holdings among a small number of wallets raises questions about market stability and the potential for volatility moving forward.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Shiba Inu's price increase reflects a broader bullish sentiment in the meme coin sector.
- The accumulation by whale wallets suggests a strategic approach to holding assets, potentially impacting liquidity.
- High wallet concentration may lead to increased volatility as prices react to changes in whale behavior.
- The positive performance of Shiba Inu in 2026 could attract more attention to meme coins, influencing investor behavior across the sector.
- This trend indicates a possible shift in market dynamics, where large holders play a more significant role in price movements compared to retail investors.
