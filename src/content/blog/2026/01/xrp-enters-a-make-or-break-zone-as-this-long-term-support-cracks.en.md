## Overview

XRP is currently at a pivotal moment in its market performance, as it has recently breached a significant long-term support level for the first time in over 400 days. This break below the 200-day moving average has raised concerns about the cryptocurrency's potential trajectory, placing it in a critical zone where the next movement could significantly impact its future.

## Key Developments

XRP has been consolidating around the psychological $2 mark, yet it has faced considerable resistance in maintaining this level. The price has recently stalled, fluctuating between $1.85 and $1.88, which indicates a tight range that often precedes a significant price movement. This situation suggests that XRP may be approaching a decisive breakout or breakdown.

Despite the recent downward movement, the daily chart still shows some resilience. Buyers have been active in defending nearby support levels, which has prevented a complete breakdown of the price structure. This defensive action keeps the broader bullish scenario intact, especially if XRP can regain higher levels with increased trading volume.

However, a broader analysis using the 3-day chart introduces a note of caution. The recent close below the 200-day moving average marks a significant technical shift, as it is the first occurrence of this nature in over 400 days. This development is critical as it could negatively affect market sentiment if not quickly reversed. The historical price structure following the notable rally in November 2024, which saw XRP rise from $0.50 to $3, is relatively thin. This suggests that any increase in selling pressure could result in sharper declines.

In light of this, potential downside targets have been identified around $1.45, $1.10, and $0.69 if a confirmed breakdown occurs. Furthermore, the recent $1 billion token unlock by Ripple adds another layer of complexity, introducing additional supply into an already sensitive market.

## Structural Analysis

According to a monthly update from a crypto analyst, XRP is currently above a crucial level that previously acted as resistance but has now transitioned to support. This shift indicates that buyers are still defending this structure, contributing to a more constructive overall setup despite recent hesitations in price movement.

A double-top formation is visible on the chart; however, it is noted that this pattern does not necessarily have to fully materialize as long as XRP remains above the 0.786 logarithmic Fibonacci level. Currently, XRP is in a consolidation phase, with price action contained within the 0.786 to 0.886 log Fibonacci range. This behavior signifies a period of balance in the market as participants await a clearer directional catalyst.

## From author

The current situation surrounding XRP illustrates the delicate balance between bullish and bearish sentiments in the cryptocurrency market. With key technical support levels being tested, the next moves will be critical in determining the asset's future direction. It is essential for investors and traders to closely monitor these developments as they unfold.

## Impact on the crypto market

- XRP's break below the 200-day moving average may lead to increased bearish sentiment among traders.
- The potential for accelerated selling pressure could affect broader market stability, particularly for altcoins.
- The successful defense of nearby support levels by buyers may bolster confidence and encourage buying activity.
- The recent token unlock by Ripple could contribute to increased volatility and price fluctuations.
- The current consolidation phase may lead to a significant breakout or breakdown, impacting trading strategies across the market.
