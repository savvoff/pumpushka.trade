## Overview

Ripple's recent developments have sparked discussions among industry participants regarding the potential for significant institutional adoption of XRP. Software engineer Vincent Van Code has emphasized the importance of infrastructure enhancements that facilitate large-scale participation in XRP, claiming that Ripple's efforts have transformed the operational landscape for institutional investors.

## Ripple's Institutional Infrastructure

In a recent post on X, Vincent Van Code outlined how Ripple has shifted the barriers to holding and utilizing XRP from market structure to what he refers to as "plumbing." He argues that Ripple has dedicated the years 2025-2026 to building an institutional stack that includes custody solutions, treasury management, and prime brokerage services. This infrastructure is designed to make it easier for large entities—such as pension funds, banks, and hedge funds—to engage with XRP without facing the complexities associated with self-custody.

Van Code critiques the traditional self-custody model, stating that it poses significant challenges for institutions managing large sums of money. He described self-custody as "audit hell" and a source of compliance nightmares, which would deter risk officers from approving its use. He believes that Ripple has addressed these concerns by developing a "Wall Street kit" that provides regulated, scalable, and bank-trusted infrastructure.

One of the key components of this infrastructure is Ripple Payments, which Van Code describes as an ISO 20022-compliant transaction layer capable of facilitating real-time cross-border payments. He notes that this system is already moving substantial amounts for global banks, which is indicative of its operational viability.

Van Code also highlighted Ripple's acquisition of GTreasury, an enterprise treasury management platform, which he claims allows corporations to manage both fiat and digital liquidity in real-time. Additionally, he mentioned Ripple Prime, powered by the Hidden Road acquisition, which offers a prime brokerage stack that includes clearing, financing, and over-the-counter trading services, all of which could utilize XRP and Ripple's RLUSD.

Regarding custody solutions, Van Code asserted that Ripple has established a bank-facing offering through various strategic acquisitions and integrations. He described Ripple Custody as a regulated storage solution with multi-chain support and security features, which he claims is auditable, insured, and scalable for substantial amounts of assets.

## From author

Vincent Van Code's assertions reflect a growing sentiment among XRP advocates that the infrastructure being built by Ripple is crucial for attracting institutional investment. The emphasis on compliance and regulated custody solutions may indeed serve to alleviate some of the concerns that traditional financial institutions have about entering the cryptocurrency space. By addressing these operational challenges, Ripple may open the door for more substantial participation from institutional players, which could have far-reaching implications for the broader market.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Ripple's focus on creating a compliant and secure infrastructure could lead to increased institutional interest in XRP.
- The development of a robust custody solution may help alleviate concerns surrounding asset security for large-scale investors.
- Enhanced liquidity and operational efficiency through Ripple Payments and Ripple Prime could facilitate greater adoption of XRP in financial transactions.
- The potential for corporate use of XRP and RLUSD may lead to new use cases and applications within traditional finance.
- If institutional flows increase as a result of these developments, it could significantly impact the overall liquidity and price discovery mechanisms in the crypto market.
