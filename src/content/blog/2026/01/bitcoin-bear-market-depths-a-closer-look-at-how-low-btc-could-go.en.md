## Overview

Recently, Bitcoin experienced a notable decline, dipping below the $90,000 mark once again. This situation has raised concerns about the possibility of entering a new bear market, prompting discussions about the cryptocurrency's future trajectory.

## Bitcoin's Recent Decline

On Tuesday, Bitcoin fell beneath the critical $90,000 threshold, igniting fears of a potential bear market. Market analyst Raun Neuner shared insights regarding this development in a post on X (formerly Twitter). While traditional stocks are reportedly performing well and commodities are undergoing what Neuner describes as a "supercycle," the cryptocurrency market continues to struggle for momentum. This disparity raises an important question: what could be the worst-case scenario for Bitcoin?

Historically, Bitcoin's bull markets have been known to peak approximately 532 days after each Halving event. If this historical pattern holds true for the current market cycle, Bitcoin might have reached its peak around early October, when it briefly approached a price of $125,000. Following such peaks, Bitcoin typically experiences significant declines of 70 to 80%. Based on this historical trend, Neuner has suggested that Bitcoin could potentially drop to around $37,000 if a full bear market materializes.

The current market dynamics also warrant consideration. After a year characterized by strong performances in both stocks and commodities, market corrections are anticipated. During periods of risk aversion in equity markets, Bitcoin has historically intensified these downward movements, which could contribute to increased pressure on its price.

Neuner indicated that a crucial reference point for Bitcoin could be around the $57,000 mark, where the 200-week moving average (MA) is located. This level may serve as a significant indicator for traders and investors alike.

## Factors Influencing Bitcoin's Price Drop

The recent decline below the $90,000 level can be attributed to various factors, including heightened volatility in global bond and equity markets, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions. Walter Bloomberg, a market analysis expert, noted that the current downtrend has been influenced by several macroeconomic factors. These include renewed tariff threats from political figures and fiscal strategies from countries like Japan, which have contributed to overall market instability.

As a result of these uncertainties, many investors have shifted their focus to safe-haven assets, such as gold, which has recently reached a record price exceeding $4,700. Bloomberg has cautioned that the macro risks facing the market may not be fully appreciated by investors. Additionally, there has been a noticeable increase in demand for downside protection within Bitcoin's options market, indicating that investors are becoming increasingly aware of the potential for further price declines.

In the near term, Bloomberg identified the next significant support levels for Bitcoin to be between $84,000 and $85,000. If Bitcoin fails to maintain these levels, the fears surrounding a deep bear market may become more pronounced.

## From author

The current situation surrounding Bitcoin serves as a crucial reminder of the volatility and unpredictability inherent in the cryptocurrency market. As traditional markets exhibit strength, Bitcoin's struggles raise questions about its resilience and future potential. The historical patterns and current market dynamics outlined by analysts like Neuner and Bloomberg provide valuable context for understanding the challenges Bitcoin may face moving forward.
