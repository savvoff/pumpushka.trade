## Overview

Seventy economists have expressed their support for a public digital euro, urging European Union lawmakers to prioritize the public interest in its development. Their warning emphasizes that private stablecoins and foreign payment firms pose a threat to Europe’s monetary sovereignty, highlighting the need for a robust digital currency that serves the public good.

## The Call for a Public Digital Euro

The group of economists asserts that the introduction of a public digital euro is essential for maintaining European monetary sovereignty. They argue that the rise of private stablecoins and the increasing influence of foreign payment companies could undermine the control that European authorities have over monetary policy and financial stability. By advocating for a public digital euro, these economists aim to ensure that the European currency remains a reliable and stable means of exchange that aligns with the broader interests of the public rather than the profit motives of private entities.

The economists' statement reflects growing concerns about the impact of unregulated digital currencies on the existing financial ecosystem. They argue that private stablecoins, which are often pegged to traditional currencies, could lead to fragmentation in the payment system and create risks for consumers. Additionally, the dominance of foreign payment firms could limit the effectiveness of European financial policies and compromise the economic sovereignty of EU member states.

By calling for a public digital euro, the economists highlight the importance of having a digital currency that is governed by public institutions rather than private interests. They believe that a state-backed digital currency could provide a safe and efficient alternative to private digital currencies, ensuring that the monetary system remains resilient and secure.

## From author

The push for a public digital euro reflects a significant sentiment among economic experts regarding the future of digital currencies in Europe. As the landscape of finance evolves with the introduction of digital assets, the role of government-backed currencies becomes increasingly crucial. The concerns raised by these economists underline a pivotal moment in the discourse surrounding digital currencies, emphasizing the need for regulatory frameworks that safeguard public interests while fostering innovation.

The debate around the digital euro is not merely about technology; it encompasses broader issues of economic control, privacy, and the future of financial transactions. As private entities continue to innovate and attract users, the challenge for policymakers will be to create a digital currency that not only competes with these alternatives but also serves the public effectively.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The call for a public digital euro may influence regulatory discussions within the EU regarding the framework for digital currencies.
- A state-backed digital euro could set a precedent for other regions considering similar initiatives, potentially reshaping the global landscape of digital currencies.
- The emphasis on public interest may lead to increased scrutiny of private stablecoins and foreign payment firms, impacting their adoption and use.
- The establishment of a public digital euro could increase trust and stability in digital transactions, potentially attracting new users to the digital currency space.
- This movement may spur further innovation in the realm of digital currencies as governments seek to respond to the challenges posed by private alternatives.
