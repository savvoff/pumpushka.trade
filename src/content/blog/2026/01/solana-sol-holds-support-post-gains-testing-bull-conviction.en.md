## Overview

Solana (SOL) has recently experienced a notable increase, consolidating above the $135 mark. As it navigates this support level, the cryptocurrency is testing the conviction of bulls while eyeing potential further gains above $140. The current market dynamics are crucial for understanding the ongoing trends in the Solana ecosystem.

## Recent Performance

Solana's price began a fresh upward movement, surpassing the $135 and $138 levels against the US Dollar. This increase is significant as it places SOL in a short-term positive zone, aligning with movements seen in other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price has been observed to trade above $135, in conjunction with the 100-hourly simple moving average, indicating a degree of bullish sentiment.

A contracting triangle is forming on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair, with established support at $138. This technical pattern suggests that the price could extend its gains if it successfully breaks through the $140 resistance zone. The bulls have previously managed to push the price above $142, highlighting their strength in the current market.

However, there has been some volatility, with the price recently dipping below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent upward movement from a swing low of $136 to a high of $141. Despite this, Solana is still trading above the critical $138 threshold and remains supported by the 100-hourly simple moving average.

On the upside, the price faces resistance around the $140 level, with the next major resistance situated near $142. A successful close above the $145 resistance zone could potentially pave the way for another steady increase, with a key resistance target set at $150. 

## Potential Downside Risks

Conversely, if SOL fails to rise above the $142 resistance, it could trigger a decline. Initial support is identified near the $138 zone, which is reinforced by a trend line and the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent upward move. The first major support level is at $136, and a significant breach of this level might lead the price toward the $130 support zone. A close below the $130 level could further result in a decline toward the $120 support in the near term.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for SOL/USD is losing momentum within the bullish zone, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment.
- **Hourly RSI**: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for SOL/USD remains above the 50 level, suggesting that the asset is still in a relatively strong position.

### Major Support Levels
- $138
- $136

### Major Resistance Levels
