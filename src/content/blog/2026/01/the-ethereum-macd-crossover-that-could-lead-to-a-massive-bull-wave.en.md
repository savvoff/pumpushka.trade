## Overview

Ethereum is demonstrating notable bullish technical strength, as momentum indicators are shifting in favor of buyers. The ETH/USD chart on the 3-day timeframe has recently printed a MACD bullish crossover, a significant signal that has historically preceded Ethereum's rallies.

## The MACD Bullish Crossover

The latest analysis indicates that Ethereum is poised for a potential rally, building on the momentum seen after a MACD bullish crossover in December 2025. This crossover, observed on the 3-day chart, occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line from below, suggesting a shift in market sentiment. This development is crucial as it indicates that downside momentum has waned and bullish pressure is beginning to strengthen among Ethereum traders.

Currently, Ethereum is trading around the $3,300 mark, which is approximately 33% below its peak in August 2025. However, it remains above the swing lows recorded in November 2025. Analysts believe this recent price action may signal the initial stages of a larger bull wave for Ethereum.

This projection draws parallels to a previous crossover that took place in April 2025, which followed a period of consolidation and pullbacks that lasted several months. That crossover marked the beginning of a multi-month rally, propelling Ethereum to a new all-time high in August 2025. 

Following the April crossover, Ethereum's price did not immediately surge. Instead, it stabilized for a few days before establishing higher lows above $1,500. Once it broke through resistance at $2,000, the rally gained momentum, ultimately pushing Ethereum from the mid-$2,000 range to above $4,800. This period saw Ethereum surpass its previous record of $4,878, which had been in place since November 2021, culminating in a peak of $4,946 in late August.

## From author

The recent MACD bullish crossover for Ethereum is a significant technical signal that could indicate a shift in market dynamics. As historical patterns suggest, such crossovers can lead to extended upward movements, creating potential opportunities for traders and investors. However, it is essential to approach these indicators with caution, as market conditions can change rapidly and unpredictably.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The MACD bullish crossover suggests a potential shift in momentum favoring buyers, which could influence trader sentiment.
- Historical precedents indicate that such crossovers may lead to significant price rallies, attracting more traders and investors to Ethereum.
- If Ethereum continues to stabilize and break through key resistance levels, it may set the stage for broader market movements within the cryptocurrency space.
- Increased bullish sentiment in Ethereum could also spill over into other cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to a wider market rally.
- The potential for Ethereum to reach new all-time highs could reinvigorate interest in the crypto sector, drawing in new investors.
