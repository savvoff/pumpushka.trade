## Overview

XRP has garnered attention from analysts despite its recent sluggish performance. A notable focus has shifted to its ratio against gold, with an analyst identifying a critical historical support zone that could influence XRP's future movements. This analysis highlights the potential for a significant reversal based on historical patterns.

## XRP/Gold Ratio Arrives At Critical Support Level

Market analyst 'Steph is Crypto' has provided insights into the XRP to gold ratio, emphasizing its historical behavior. The ratio has recently returned to a support zone around $0.0004, a level that has previously marked significant turning points in XRP's performance relative to gold. 

In the analysis shared on social media, it was noted that previous interactions with this support zone have been followed by substantial upward movements in the XRP/gold ratio. The analyst pointed out that each time the ratio approached this level, it was succeeded by sharp reversals, indicating a potential for future price increases. Historical data shows that past rallies included substantial gains, including notable increases in 2020, 2022, and 2024.

Additionally, the analyst highlighted momentum conditions, referencing the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which was previously in an oversold state when the XRP/gold ratio hit this historical support. Currently, the RSI is around 33.38, suggesting a similar oversold condition as seen in prior cycles. This oversold situation indicates that the downside momentum may be diminishing, which could set the stage for a potential rally if historical trends are to repeat.

The general outlook from this analysis suggests that if the past is any indication, the XRP/gold ratio might experience another significant rally, potentially moving from the established support level of $0.0004 to over $0.0018.

## Analyst Links XRP Trajectory To That Of Gold And Silver

In a follow-up analysis, Steph is Crypto drew parallels between the historical price movements of gold and silver with that of XRP. The analyst presented charts that illustrated the distinct phases of price action for these assets, particularly focusing on the periods leading up to major rallies in the precious metals market.

The review of gold and silver's price history revealed that both assets underwent a major distribution phase in 2021, followed by a compression phase in 2023, and are expected to enter an expansion phase in 2026. Gold, for instance, experienced a sharp and vertical price reversal, reaching significant highs with minimal pullbacks. Conversely, silver's price movements exhibited more volatility before accelerating in 2026.

Based on these observations, the analyst predicts that XRP may follow a similar trajectory. Having completed its distribution phase above $3 and its compression phase near $2.3, there is an expectation for XRP to enter its own expansion phase, with ambitious projections for its all-time high.

The focus on technical indicators like the RSI and the comparison with precious metals provides a framework for understanding XRP's possible future movements. As is often the case in the crypto market, past performance can offer insights, but it remains essential for investors to approach with caution given the inherent volatility.
