## Overview

Bitwise, a prominent player in the crypto space, is set to launch on-chain vaults in collaboration with Morphos. The initial strategy of these vaults aims to achieve a 6% annual percentage yield through over-collateralized lending pools, which will be managed by Bitwise.

## Details of the Vault Strategy

The launch of on-chain vaults marks a significant development for Bitwise as it expands its offerings in the crypto market. The first vault strategy is designed with a clear goal: to provide participants with an annual percentage yield of 6%. This yield is expected to be generated through the use of over-collateralized lending pools. 

Over-collateralization is a method commonly used in decentralized finance (DeFi) that ensures borrowers provide collateral exceeding the value of the loan they seek. This practice helps mitigate risks associated with lending, as it provides a buffer against market volatility and borrower defaults. By employing this strategy, Bitwise aims to create a more secure investment environment for users engaging with their vaults.

The management of these lending pools will be handled by Bitwise, which brings a level of expertise to the operation. As a well-established entity in the crypto sector, Bitwise's involvement in managing these pools could enhance investor confidence. The combination of a structured yield generation strategy and the experienced management team suggests that Bitwise is committed to delivering a reliable product to its users.

## From author

The introduction of on-chain vaults by Bitwise represents a strategic move to tap into the growing interest in yield-generating opportunities within the cryptocurrency landscape. By focusing on over-collateralized lending pools, Bitwise is taking a prudent approach to risk management, which is crucial in the often-volatile crypto market. The emphasis on a specified annual percentage yield adds an attractive feature for potential investors looking for stable returns.

This initiative could also reflect a broader trend within the crypto industry, where traditional financial strategies are being adapted to fit the decentralized framework. As more companies explore similar avenues, the competitive landscape will likely shift, pushing for innovation and more secure investment options.
