## Overview

Bitcoin has recently experienced a significant price increase, surpassing the $92,000 mark and showing signs of bullish momentum. However, it faces potential challenges at the $95,000 resistance level, which could impact its upward trajectory in the near term.

## Recent Price Movements

Bitcoin's price began a fresh increase, moving above the $92,200 zone. Currently, it is trading above $92,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A key bullish trend line is forming, providing support at $92,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. This trend suggests that if Bitcoin maintains its position above the $92,000 zone, it may continue to rise.

After remaining supported above the $91,200 zone, Bitcoin started to gain momentum, breaking through the $92,000 and $92,200 resistance levels. The price even exceeded $94,000, reaching a new multi-week high at $94,783 before entering a phase of consolidation. Following this peak, there was a slight decline below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent upward move from a swing low of $90,805 to the high of $94,783.

Bitcoin continues to trade above $92,500, supported by the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance levels are identified around $94,200 and $94,500, with a critical barrier at $95,000. If Bitcoin manages to close above this resistance, it could pave the way for further increases, potentially reaching the $95,800 resistance level, followed by targets at $96,500, $97,000, and $97,200.

## Potential Downside Risks

Conversely, if Bitcoin fails to break through the $94,500 resistance zone, it may face another decline. Immediate support is located near the $93,200 level, with the first major support around $92,800, coinciding with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent upward move. Additional support can be found near the $92,500 zone, and if losses continue, the price could drop toward the $91,200 support level. The main support level is positioned at $90,000, and a drop below this threshold could result in a more significant downward movement.

## From author

The current situation surrounding Bitcoin's price reflects a critical moment for traders and investors. The resistance levels, particularly at $95,000, are essential for gauging the potential continuation of Bitcoin's bullish trend. Observing how Bitcoin reacts to these resistance and support levels will provide insight into market sentiment and future price movements.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Bitcoin's recent price surge may influence other cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to a broader bullish market sentiment.

- The overall market volatility may increase as traders react to Bitcoin's movements around these key levels, impacting trading strategies across the board.
- Monitoring Bitcoin's performance in relation to these support and resistance levels will be crucial for understanding market dynamics in the coming days.
