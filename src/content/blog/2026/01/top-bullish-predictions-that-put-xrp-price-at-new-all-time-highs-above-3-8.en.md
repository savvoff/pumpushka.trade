## Overview

Recent predictions have emerged suggesting that XRP could reach new all-time highs, surpassing the $3.8 mark. Despite currently trading significantly below its previous peak, various analyses from financial institutions and market analysts indicate a potential bullish trend for XRP in the near future.

## Current Price Action

As of January 13, 2026, XRP is trading around $2.06, which is a notable decrease from its July 2025 peak of $3.65. This decline represents a drop of approximately 44%. Analysts have pointed out that XRP is struggling to maintain its price above $2, a crucial psychological barrier. Despite this, there are bullish predictions circulating that suggest XRP could reclaim its previous highs and push into new price territories above $3.8. 

## Institutional Projections

One of the most significant institutional forecasts comes from Standard Chartered’s digital assets research team. Their analysis indicates a multi-year trajectory for XRP, projecting that it could exceed the $3.8 threshold and potentially reach as high as $8 by the end of 2026. This prediction implies a substantial upside potential from current price levels, contingent on ongoing institutional adoption and strong inflows into XRP-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Geoffrey Kendrick, the Global Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, has contributed to this optimistic outlook, emphasizing the role of institutional interest in driving XRP's price recovery. The presence of institutional buying activity is seen as a positive sign amid the current market struggles.

## Technical Analysis

Technical analyses have also adopted a bullish stance regarding XRP's price trajectory. Analysts have observed a developing breakout retest structure on the monthly candlestick timeframe. One analyst, EGRAG CRYPTO, noted that as long as XRP maintains its position above the $1.60 to $1.40 range on higher timeframes, historical probabilities favor an upward movement. Long-term projections suggest that XRP could potentially reach as high as $22.

In the short term, another analyst, Crypto Feras, identified XRP's recent price movement above $2 as a bullish reversal signal. He highlighted resistance levels at $2.67 and $3.01, which, if surpassed, could pave the way for a full retest of the previous peak near $3.8. Additionally, ChartNerd indicated that XRP’s long-term upside fractal structure remains intact despite recent corrections.

## Ripple's Strategic Positioning

Ripple is actively positioning itself for a pivotal year ahead. CEO Brad Garlinghouse has pointed to significant progress made in 2025, including acquisitions of Ripple Prime and GTreasury, as well as an expanding global licensing footprint. This strategic positioning reinforces the narrative that XRP may be on the verge of a significant price movement as Ripple heads into what is being described as a consequential 2026.

## From author

The convergence of institutional interest, positive technical analyses, and Ripple's strategic initiatives provides a compelling case for XRP's potential recovery. As the market continues to evolve, the insights from both institutional analysts and market commentators will play a crucial role in shaping investor sentiment and expectations.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased institutional interest in XRP could signal a broader trend of institutional adoption within the crypto space.
- A successful price recovery for XRP may influence other cryptocurrencies, leading to increased market confidence.
- Technical bullish projections could attract more retail investors, further driving demand.
- Ripple's strategic acquisitions and global licensing efforts may enhance its competitive position in the crypto market.
