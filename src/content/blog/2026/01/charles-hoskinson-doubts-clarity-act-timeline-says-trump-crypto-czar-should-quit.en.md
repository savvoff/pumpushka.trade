## Overview

Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has expressed skepticism regarding the passage of the CLARITY Act within the current quarter. He has also voiced concerns about the existing cryptocurrency regulations in the United States, suggesting that they tend to favor large financial institutions at the expense of innovation in the crypto space.

## Hoskinson's Concerns About the CLARITY Act

During a recent discussion, Hoskinson indicated that he does not anticipate the CLARITY Act to be approved in the near term. His comments highlight a growing frustration among crypto advocates regarding the legislative process surrounding cryptocurrency regulation. The CLARITY Act, which aims to provide a clearer framework for cryptocurrency regulations, has been a focal point for those seeking to establish a more defined legal environment for digital assets.

Hoskinson's criticism extends beyond just the timeline of the CLARITY Act. He has pointed out that the current regulatory landscape in the United States seems to prioritize the interests of large banks and financial institutions rather than fostering an environment conducive to innovation and growth within the cryptocurrency sector. This perspective aligns with broader concerns among industry stakeholders who argue that overly restrictive regulations could stifle the development of new technologies and business models in the crypto space.

## Implications of Current US Crypto Laws

Hoskinson's remarks reflect a growing sentiment that the current regulatory framework may not be conducive to the advancement of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. The criticism of US crypto laws for favoring large banks raises important questions about the future of innovation in the sector. As regulatory discussions continue, the balance between ensuring consumer protection and promoting innovation remains a key point of contention.
