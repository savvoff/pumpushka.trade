This potential move was discussed by co-founder and CEO Ronghui Gu during an event in Davos, highlighting the significance of such a listing for companies operating within the blockchain and decentralized technology sectors.

## CertiK's Potential IPO

During his address in Davos, Ronghui Gu articulated that a public offering for CertiK would mark a pivotal moment for the company and the broader Web3 industry.
