## Overview

Natix, a project based on the Solana blockchain, has partnered with Valeo to develop a decentralized self-driving camera model. This initiative aims to provide a transparent framework for the secure and widespread adoption of physical artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.

## What Happened

The collaboration between Natix and Valeo signifies a notable advancement in the integration of decentralized technology and artificial intelligence. The two entities are working together to create a self-driving camera model that will utilize decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN). This partnership is focused on ensuring that the deployment of physical AIs can be conducted safely and transparently, which is crucial for gaining public trust and regulatory approval.

The self-driving camera model is expected to leverage the capabilities of decentralized networks to enhance the data collection and processing necessary for autonomous operations. By utilizing blockchain technology, the model aims to provide an immutable record of data and actions taken by the AI, which can be crucial for accountability and safety in real-world applications.

The importance of this initiative cannot be overstated, as the deployment of physical AIs, such as autonomous vehicles and smart cameras, raises significant safety and ethical concerns. By establishing a transparent framework, Natix and Valeo aim to address these concerns proactively, potentially setting a precedent for future developments in the field of AI.
