## Overview

Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a notable decline on Thursday, continuing a downward trend that has persisted throughout the week. The cryptocurrency briefly fell below the significant $85,000 threshold, despite recent advancements in US legislation aimed at establishing a clearer framework for the crypto market.

## Market Reaction to Regulatory Developments

The decline in Bitcoin's value occurred on the same day that the Senate Agriculture Committee advanced its segment of the proposed crypto market structure legislation, known as the CLARITY Act. This legislative move was generally perceived as a positive step for the digital asset industry. However, the anticipation surrounding the bill did not translate into immediate market support, as prices continued to slide.

Instead of responding favorably to the news, the market faced a sharp sell-off. Bitcoin's price dropped by approximately $2,700 in a short timeframe, triggering a wave of liquidations across the market. Reports indicate that this sell-off resulted in an estimated $356 million in long positions being liquidated. Additionally, data from Coinglass revealed that total liquidations across the entire crypto market reached around $803 million within a 24-hour period, which included approximately $693 million from long liquidations and about $109 million from short liquidations.

## Legislative Progress and Its Implications

The CLARITY Act's advancement represents a crucial step in the ongoing effort to create a more defined regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. Following the Agriculture Committee's approval, the next phase involves merging the provisions that expand the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) authority with corresponding sections overseen by the Senate Banking Committee that relate to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s jurisdiction.

Lawmakers now face the challenge of determining if bipartisan support can still be garnered for this significant measure, which has the potential to reshape the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the US. The ability to unify these legislative efforts may play a critical role in the future development of the digital asset market.

## Technical Analysis

From a technical standpoint, market analyst Rekt Capital suggested that Bitcoin must avoid allowing the former range low around $86,000 to become a point of resistance in the near term. He emphasized that a weekly close above this level is essential to prevent a deeper breakdown in price. A decisive drop below the $86,000 mark could potentially lead to a retest of the macro triangle bottom near $82,500, which, if breached, might signal an acceleration of bearish momentum.

Currently, Bitcoin has only managed a brief recovery to around $85,135, but it remains significantly distant from the critical levels identified by analysts. Thus, the price movements on Friday are anticipated to be pivotal in determining Bitcoin's forthcoming trajectory.

## From author

The interplay between regulatory developments and market sentiment is often complex in the cryptocurrency space. While legislative progress like the CLARITY Act is necessary for the maturation of the market, the immediate market reactions can sometimes defy expectations. The ongoing volatility underscores the need for investors to remain vigilant and informed as the landscape evolves.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Bitcoin continues to struggle with maintaining key support levels, impacting overall market sentiment.
- The legislative advancements, while positive, have not yet translated into price stability for cryptocurrencies.
- Significant liquidations indicate heightened volatility and risk among traders in the crypto market.
- The potential for further regulatory clarity may influence future investment decisions and market dynamics.
- The outcome of the ongoing legislative discussions could have long-term implications for the regulatory framework governing digital assets in the US.
