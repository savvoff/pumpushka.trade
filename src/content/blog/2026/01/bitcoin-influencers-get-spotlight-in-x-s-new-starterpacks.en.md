## Overview

X is introducing a new feature called Starterpacks, aimed at facilitating the discovery of accounts centered around specific interests, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency topics. This initiative is designed to streamline the process for new users to find relevant accounts to follow, ultimately enhancing their engagement with the platform.

## Details of the Starterpacks Feature

The Starterpacks feature will allow users to follow curated groups of accounts that are organized by themes, encompassing over 1,000 interest categories. This extensive range includes several packs focused on Bitcoin, which will bring together prominent commentators, active traders, and market analysts. The goal is to ensure that newcomers can quickly engage in meaningful conversations without the hassle of searching for individual accounts.

X's product team has reportedly spent months developing these curated sets, which are generated internally rather than by user contributions. This approach differs from similar features on competing platforms, where users typically create their own lists. The Starterpacks aim to simplify the onboarding process for new users by providing them with a starting point that includes a mix of analysts, podcasters, and traders in the cryptocurrency space.

## Why the Focus on Crypto?

Reports indicate that engagement related to cryptocurrency on X has declined, particularly concerning Bitcoin discussions. This decrease in activity in 2025 appears to have influenced product teams to revitalize the visibility of crypto creators on the platform. By implementing Starterpacks, X aims to reduce the friction for users who wish to engage in market discussions without the need to follow numerous accounts individually.

## How Starterpacks Operate

Each Starterpack is designed to group a limited number of accounts around a specific theme. Users have the flexibility to accept a pack as a starting point and can easily add or remove accounts according to their preferences. Some packs will cater to regional interests, while others focus on specific hobbies or professional fields. The assembly of these lists involved a comprehensive search for active voices across various niches, ensuring that users have access to a variety of perspectives.

## Community Reactions

The introduction of Starterpacks has elicited mixed reactions within the cryptocurrency community on X. While many creators have expressed enthusiasm about the potential for increased visibility and engagement with their posts, there are concerns that the curated nature of these packs may favor certain voices over others. This has sparked a debate regarding the implications of curated content on smaller accounts and the overall shaping of feeds as the feature rolls out.

## From Author

The introduction of Starterpacks by X represents a significant shift in how users can engage with cryptocurrency discussions on the platform. By focusing on the curation of accounts, X is not only responding to a decline in crypto-related engagement but also attempting to enhance the user experience for newcomers. As the feature rolls out, it will be interesting to observe how it influences the dynamics of community interaction and whether it addresses the concerns raised by users.
