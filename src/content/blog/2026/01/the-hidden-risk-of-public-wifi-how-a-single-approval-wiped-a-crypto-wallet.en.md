## Overview

A recent incident highlights the vulnerabilities associated with using public WiFi networks, particularly for crypto users. A crypto user experienced a significant loss after approving a transaction while connected to an open WiFi network at a hotel, emphasizing the risks of such environments.

## Incident Details

The crypto user reported losing $5,000 from a hot wallet during a hotel stay. The individual attributed the loss primarily to the dangers posed by open WiFi networks. While using the hotel’s WiFi, the user made a casual phone call from the lobby, which inadvertently contributed to the loss.

The wallet approval, a necessary step for executing transactions in the crypto space, was executed carelessly. This suggests that the user was not fully aware of the implications of the approval process while connected to an unsecured network. The combination of an open WiFi connection and a lack of attention to wallet approvals created a perfect storm for the theft.

This incident serves as a cautionary tale for crypto users who may underestimate the risks associated with public WiFi. The user’s experience underscores the importance of maintaining vigilance and security protocols in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.
