## Overview

Ethereum is currently experiencing a decline after failing to maintain stability above a significant resistance level. The cryptocurrency is now at risk of further losses as it trades below key price points. 

## Recent Price Movements

Ethereum began to decline from the $3,300 resistance level, entering a bearish phase. The price has fallen below $3,250 and is currently trading below $3,220, indicating a consolidation of losses. This downward movement is accompanied by the formation of a short-term declining channel, with resistance identified at $3,210 on the hourly chart for ETH/USD.

The decline has been exacerbated by the bears, who have managed to push the price below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, which was derived from the recent price wave between the $3,060 swing low and the $3,402 high. As a result, Ethereum has tested the $3,160 level and is currently in a phase of consolidating its losses.

Despite the bearish sentiment, there is potential for a rebound if Ethereum can maintain its position above the $3,160 zone. Immediate resistance is observed near the $3,220 level, while the first key resistance is noted around $3,260. A move above $3,280 could lead to further gains, potentially pushing the price toward the $3,320 resistance level. If this region is cleared, there may be a possibility for Ethereum to rise toward the $3,400 or even the $3,450 resistance zones in the near future.

## Potential for Further Decline

On the downside, Ethereum faces challenges if it cannot breach the $3,220 resistance. Initial support is positioned near the $3,160 level, while the first major support is located around the $3,140 zone, corresponding to the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent price movement. A decisive move below the $3,140 support could lead to further declines, possibly targeting the $3,080 support level. Any sustained losses beyond this point might push Ethereum toward the $3,050 region, with a significant support level identified at $3,000.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for ETH/USD is currently gaining momentum in the bearish zone, indicating a strengthening downward trend.
- **Hourly RSI**: The RSI for ETH/USD has fallen below the 50 zone, reflecting bearish momentum.
- **Major Support Level**: $3,160
