The report highlights record-breaking achievements in revenue, daily active wallets, and decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, underscoring the blockchain's robust performance.

## Major Growth Metrics

In its 2025 annual review, Solana reported that applications built on its platform generated $2.39 billion in revenue, marking a year-over-year increase of 46% and establishing a new all-time high (ATH).

Additionally, smaller applications collectively contributed over $500 million in revenue.

Solana's network performance indicators also reflected impressive growth. The blockchain achieved a revenue of $1.4 billion, representing a significant increase over the past two years. Non-vote transactions reached a new ATH of 33 billion, with a year-over-year growth of 28%. The network averaged 1,054 non-vote transactions per second (TPS) while unique active wallets averaged 3.2 million daily, which is a 50% increase compared to the previous year. Throughout the year, Solana saw the creation of 725 million new wallets.

In terms of asset management, Solana's stablecoin supply ended 2025 at $14.8 billion, more than doubling compared to the previous year. The blockchain facilitated a total of $11.7 trillion in stablecoin transfers, marking a sevenfold increase over two years. Notably, equities made their debut on Solana in 2025, achieving a supply of $1 billion and a trading volume of $651 million.

Bitcoin trading volume also experienced significant growth, reaching $33 billion, which solidified a new ATH. The total Bitcoin supply doubled to 770 million. In addition, the number of staked SOL tokens increased to 421 million, representing an 8% growth and another ATH. The introduction of Solana ETFs attracted net inflows of $1.02 billion, further enhancing the platform's investment appeal.
