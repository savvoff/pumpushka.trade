## Overview

Mandiant, a security firm operating under Google Cloud, has identified a malware campaign linked to North Korean scammers. This campaign has been tracked since 2018, but advancements in artificial intelligence have significantly increased the scale of these malicious attacks beginning in November 2025.

## Details of the Malware Campaign

Mandiant has been monitoring the activities of suspected North Korean cyber criminals for several years. Since 2018, they have gathered intelligence on the tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by these scammers. The focus of their investigation has been to understand how these actors operate and the potential impact they have on the cryptocurrency landscape.

The significance of this malware campaign lies in its connection to North Korea, a nation known for its cyber operations aimed at financial gain. The activities attributed to these scammers can have far-reaching implications for the security of cryptocurrency networks and the overall integrity of digital assets.

A critical factor in the escalation of these attacks is the integration of artificial intelligence technology. Since November 2025, AI has played a pivotal role in enhancing the capabilities of these cybercriminals. The use of AI can allow for more sophisticated methods of attack, making it easier for scammers to exploit vulnerabilities in systems and potentially compromise the security of cryptocurrency transactions.
