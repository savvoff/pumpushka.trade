## Overview

Recent findings from JPMorgan Private Bank's 2026 Global Family Office Report reveal a significant reluctance among wealthy families to engage with cryptocurrency. The report indicates that a staggering 89% of family offices currently do not hold any digital assets, highlighting a cautious stance towards the crypto market despite its growing prominence.

## Findings from the JPMorgan Report

The 2026 Global Family Office Report by JPMorgan Private Bank sheds light on the investment behaviors of wealthy families regarding traditional and emerging hedges. The report illustrates a clear trend: the majority of family offices are steering clear of cryptocurrency investments. Specifically, 89% of these family offices have reported that they do not hold any form of digital assets.

This finding raises important questions about the factors influencing the investment decisions of wealthy families. Despite the ongoing hype surrounding cryptocurrency and its potential for high returns, it appears that family offices are prioritizing stability and security over speculative assets. This cautious approach could be attributed to a variety of concerns, including market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and the perceived risks associated with digital currencies.

The report further suggests that wealthy families continue to favor more traditional forms of investment, which may include equities, real estate, and fixed income. Such preferences indicate a broader trend among family offices to seek out investments that align with their long-term financial goals and risk tolerance.

## From author

The findings from JPMorgan Private Bank's report provide a crucial insight into the current mindset of wealthy families regarding cryptocurrency. The fact that 89% of family offices are not engaging with digital assets suggests a broader hesitation within the investment community, which may be rooted in concerns about the inherent volatility and risks associated with the crypto market. This cautious stance could have implications for how cryptocurrency is perceived and adopted by institutional investors in the future.

As the crypto market continues to evolve, the reluctance of family offices to invest may reflect a need for greater regulatory clarity and a more stable market environment. It remains to be seen whether these wealthy families will eventually embrace cryptocurrencies as a viable investment option or if they will continue to prioritize more traditional asset classes.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The significant reluctance of family offices to invest in cryptocurrencies may contribute to a perception of instability in the market.
