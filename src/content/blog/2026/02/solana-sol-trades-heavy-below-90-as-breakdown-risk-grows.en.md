## Overview

Solana's price has experienced a notable decline, trading below $85 after failing to maintain levels above $90. This downward trend indicates a potential for further losses, with critical support levels identified.

## Breakdown of Recent Price Movements

Solana, a prominent cryptocurrency, has recently struggled to sustain its value above the $90 mark. Following this inability to hold, the price began a downward correction, dipping below the $85 threshold against the US Dollar. Currently, it is trading below the $82 level and has fallen beneath the 100-hourly simple moving average, indicating a bearish sentiment in the market.

A bearish trend line has formed, presenting resistance at the $81 level on the hourly chart for the SOL/USD pair. The current trading environment suggests that if the price dips below the $76 zone, further losses could follow. The movement below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the upward wave from a previous swing low to a recent high further emphasizes this bearish trend.

As Solana's price continues to struggle, it faces significant resistance near the $81 mark, with another notable resistance point at $82.20. The major resistance level is established at $85, where a successful close above this zone could lead to an increase in price momentum. Conversely, if the price does not rise above the $82 resistance, it may initiate another decline.

## Technical Indicators and Support Levels

In terms of technical indicators, the hourly MACD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone, signaling a continuation of the downward trend. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for SOL/USD is currently below the 50 level, reinforcing the bearish outlook.

Support levels have been identified, with initial support near the $76 zone and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the upward wave. The first major support level is at $72.50. A breach of the $72.50 support could lead to further declines, with potential targets around the $68 support zone. If the price closes below $68, it may approach the $60 support level in the near future.
