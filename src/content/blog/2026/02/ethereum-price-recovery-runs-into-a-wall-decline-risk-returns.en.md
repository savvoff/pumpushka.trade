## Overview

Ethereum has encountered significant challenges in its price recovery, experiencing a decline below key support levels. As Ethereum attempts to rebound from a low, it faces substantial resistance that could hinder its upward movement.

## Current Price Movement

Ethereum's price has dipped below $2,220 and $2,200, marking a notable decline. Following this drop, Ethereum is making an effort to recover from a low of $2,107. The price has managed to rise above $2,220, but it continues to face hurdles, particularly around the $2,250 mark. 

The failure to maintain stability above $2,320 has contributed to Ethereum's downward trajectory. This bearish trend has been reflected in the price movement, as Ethereum trades below $2,265 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Additionally, a major bearish trend line is forming, indicating resistance at $2,250 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If the price remains below the $2,350 zone, there is a risk of further declines.

### Resistance Levels

The immediate resistance for Ethereum is situated near the $2,250 level, with the first key resistance identified around $2,265. Should Ethereum manage to break through the $2,460 resistance, it could potentially lead to a price increase towards the $2,575 resistance or the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the decline from the $3,040 swing high to the $2,107 low. 

An upside breakthrough above the $2,575 region could indicate a more significant upward movement, potentially leading Ethereum toward the $2,680 resistance zone or even $2,700 in the near term.

### Support Levels

On the downside, if Ethereum fails to overcome the $2,265 resistance, it may initiate a fresh decline. The initial support level is near $2,200, with the first major support identified at approximately $2,175. A decisive move below $2,175 could further push the price towards the $2,120 support level. Continued losses may lead to a decline toward the $2,050 region, with the main support level being around $2,000.

### Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum within the bearish zone, indicating potential further declines.
- **Hourly RSI**: The RSI for ETH/USD is currently below the 50 zone, suggesting weakness in the price action.
