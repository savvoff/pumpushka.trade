## Overview

Robert Kiyosaki, the author of "Rich Dad Poor Dad," has expressed a strong preference for Bitcoin over gold in a recent social media post. He highlighted the unique supply characteristics of Bitcoin as the primary reason for his choice, sparking discussions among his followers about the merits of both assets.

## Kiyosaki's Perspective on Bitcoin vs. Gold

In his comparison, Kiyosaki emphasized that if he had to choose between investing solely in Bitcoin or gold, he would opt for Bitcoin. He acknowledged that a balanced investment strategy would ideally include both gold and Bitcoin, along with silver for further diversification. However, his preference for Bitcoin stems from its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, which he argues gives it a significant advantage over gold.

Kiyosaki pointed out that the total reserves of gold are uncertain and can be increased through technological advancements and exploration. In contrast, Bitcoin's issuance is mathematically predetermined, ensuring that no more than 21 million coins will ever be mined. Currently, more than 19 million Bitcoin have been mined, indicating that the network is nearing its maximum supply limit. Kiyosaki considers this design to be "brilliant," as it creates a structural advantage for Bitcoin in terms of scarcity.

He explained that as demand for Bitcoin increases while its supply remains fixed, basic economic principles suggest that this dynamic will lead to upward pressure on its price over time. Kiyosaki's commentary reflects a broader sentiment among some investors who view Bitcoin's engineered scarcity as a key factor in its potential for long-term appreciation.

## From author

Kiyosaki's insights into the Bitcoin versus gold debate highlight a fundamental aspect of investment strategy: the importance of understanding supply and demand dynamics.

As discussions around cryptocurrencies and precious metals continue, Kiyosaki's perspective adds to the ongoing dialogue about the future of these markets.
