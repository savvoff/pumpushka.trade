## Overview

Recent analysis of Dogecoin's price action has highlighted a potential pattern that could lead to a significant rally. A crypto analyst has pointed out that the Price Momentum Oscillator (PMO) has reached levels that have historically preceded substantial price increases for the meme coin. This comes amid a broader downtrend in the cryptocurrency market.

## Dogecoin Price Momentum Oscillator Decline

Trader Tardigrade, a crypto analyst, has emphasized the significance of the Dogecoin price weekly chart in a recent analysis. He noted that the PMO has declined to levels that previously triggered notable rallies for Dogecoin. Historically, this meme coin experienced a remarkable surge of 21,000% between 2015 and 2018, as well as an 800% increase between 2022 and 2024, coinciding with similar PMO levels.

The current market conditions have seen Dogecoin's price fall to the $0.10 support level. However, Trader Tardigrade posits that this decline could signify a bottom for the cryptocurrency, particularly as an ascending triangle pattern is forming on the 4-hour chart. This pattern suggests potential bullish momentum could develop.

## Analysts Weigh In on Dogecoin's Future

In addition to Trader Tardigrade, other analysts have expressed their views on Dogecoin's price trajectory. Analyst Crypto GVR has commented that the chart indicates clear signs of a reversal, predicting that Dogecoin could rise to between $0.3 and $0.5 in the long term. Meanwhile, analyst Top Gainer has noted that Dogecoin is currently in an accumulation zone, which could lead to a substantial breakout, potentially targeting the $1 mark.

Furthermore, analyst Bitcoinsensus has indicated that Dogecoin might be aiming for the $0.13 zone for a breakout. He pointed out that a bullish MACD print has been confirmed on the 4-hour timeframe, suggesting a rebound for the meme coin. If this bullish momentum continues, Dogecoin could target its last pivot high, further reinforcing the notion of a potential upward trend.

However, not all analysts are entirely optimistic. Analyst CryptoCeek remarked on the recent price action, indicating that the brief drop below $0.10 could have led to a classic panic flush. He warned that a rejection at the $0.12 level might result in a deeper drop to $0.08. Conversely, if Dogecoin manages to break above this level, it could potentially rally to $0.16 in the short term.
