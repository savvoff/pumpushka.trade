## Overview

Aviva Investors, a prominent asset management firm based in the U.K., has announced a collaboration with Ripple to tokenize traditional fund structures on the XRP Ledger. This partnership marks Aviva's initial foray into the tokenization of funds, a significant step in integrating traditional finance with blockchain technology.

## What Happened

Aviva Investors has embarked on an innovative project to bring traditional fund structures onto the blockchain through a partnership with Ripple. This collaboration represents a strategic move to leverage blockchain technology for fund management, aiming to enhance operational efficiency and transparency in the investment process.
