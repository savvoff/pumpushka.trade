## Overview

LayerZero's native token, ZRO, has experienced a significant surge, climbing over 40% within a single day. This spike follows the announcement of LayerZero's new Layer-1 blockchain, called Zero, which is backed by notable institutional players and aims to transform the landscape of institutional financial markets.

## LayerZero Unveils Zero Blockchain

On Tuesday, LayerZero Labs made a pivotal announcement regarding its new Layer-1 blockchain, Zero. This blockchain is specifically designed to cater to institutional financial markets and is set to launch in the fall of 2026. The initial rollout will include three distinct “zones,” which are described as permissionless environments that will be fully owned and governed by the underlying network.

ZRO will function as the native token of the Zero blockchain, facilitating interoperability between the various zones and the 165+ blockchains that it connects. The architecture of Zero aims to address long-standing scalability challenges faced by decentralized networks. LayerZero Labs has indicated that Zero is capable of processing 2 million transactions per second (TPS) per zone while maintaining near-zero transaction fees. This is achieved by targeting four primary bottlenecks in network performance.

The company elaborated on its innovative approach by stating that it utilizes Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs to separate execution from verification. This structural shift allows for the introduction of two distinct classes of validators: lightweight Block Validators, which can operate on low-grade consumer hardware, and optional higher-performance Block Producers.

Bryan Pellegrino, the CEO of LayerZero Labs, has expressed confidence in Zero's architecture, claiming it advances the industry's development by at least a decade. He articulated a vision where this technology could facilitate bringing the entire global economy onto the blockchain, emphasizing the mission to create permissionless infrastructure for a better world.

## Major Institutional Backing

The launch of the Zero blockchain has garnered support from significant institutional players. Among these are Citadel Securities, The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), ARK Invest, Google Cloud, and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Citadel Securities is not only investing in ZRO but is also exploring how its technology can enhance trading, clearing, and settlement workflows.

ARK Invest has taken a stake in LayerZero equity and ZRO, with CEO Cathie Wood joining LayerZero's advisory board. Alongside her are notable figures such as Michael Blaugrund from ICE and Caroline Butler, the former head of digital assets at BNY Mellon. Wood remarked on the historic opportunity presented at the crossroads of finance and the internet, expressing enthusiasm for accelerating the adoption of Zero within major markets.

DTCC is set to investigate the architecture of the Zero blockchain to improve the scalability of its DTC Tokenization Service and collateral management. ICE aims to explore the blockchain for continuous trading and tokenized collateral. Google Cloud has partnered with LayerZero to investigate the potential for AI agents to facilitate instant micropayments and resource trading. Additionally, Tether has announced a separate strategic investment in LayerZero Labs.
