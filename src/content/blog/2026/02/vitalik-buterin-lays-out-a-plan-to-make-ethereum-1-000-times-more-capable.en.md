## Overview

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has unveiled a comprehensive technical roadmap that outlines a potential plan for the Ethereum network to increase its transaction capacity up to 1,000 times its current level. This ambitious proposal, referred to as the “Strawmap,” focuses on optimizing execution, data handling, and state management without alienating smaller node operators, which is crucial for maintaining the network's decentralization.

## Detailed Roadmap

On February 27, Buterin shared a document that breaks down the strategy into three main problem areas: execution, data, and state. The roadmap prioritizes near-term upgrades that could set the foundation for more significant enhancements in the future.

### Near-Term Upgrades

The first major upgrade mentioned is called “Glamsterdam.” This protocol upgrade aims to introduce block-level access lists, which will enable different components of a block to be processed simultaneously. This change is expected to enhance the efficiency of each 12-second block slot, allowing for more transactions to be packed into each block while maintaining network stability.

Buterin noted that with these improvements and better client software, the Ethereum network might achieve a stable state without the need for the full 1,000x scaling effort. He suggested that if actual usage remains low, the initiative to reach 1,000 times capacity could be postponed in favor of other priorities.

### Long-Term Ambitions

The roadmap also highlights the role of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (ZK-EVMs) in its long-term plans. ZK-EVMs would allow validators to confirm transactions using cryptographic proofs instead of requiring every validator to re-run each transaction. This significant shift could reduce the computational burden on node operators, enabling a substantial increase in network capacity without necessitating upgrades to their hardware.

Reports indicate that Buterin envisions a small group of validators beginning to utilize this method as early as 2026, with broader adoption potentially occurring in 2027. This transition could drastically enhance the network's capacity ceiling while still ensuring that smaller operators are not pushed out of the ecosystem.

### Addressing State Growth

Another critical issue raised by Buterin is state growth, which has been described as an underappreciated problem. The deployment of large smart contracts adds data that must be permanently stored by every Ethereum node, which increases operational costs over time. To address this, Buterin proposes a solution that tracks state creation gas independently, ensuring that the costs of deploying large contracts reflect their actual long-term storage requirements.

It is important to note that the 1,000x scaling figure represents a long-term goal rather than an immediate promise. Each phase of the proposed plan is contingent upon the successful implementation of the preceding phase.

## From Author

Buterin's roadmap presents a strategic approach to enhancing Ethereum's scalability while taking into account the diverse ecosystem of node operators. By emphasizing the importance of decentralization, the proposed upgrades seek to balance increased capacity with accessibility for smaller participants. This careful consideration may play a pivotal role in the network's future adoption and sustainability.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- The proposed upgrades could significantly enhance Ethereum's transaction capacity, potentially increasing its utility in various applications.
- Improved transaction processing efficiency may attract more developers and projects to the Ethereum ecosystem, fostering innovation.
- The emphasis on maintaining decentralization could strengthen community trust and engagement within the Ethereum network.
- The roadmap's focus on zero-knowledge technology might set a precedent for future blockchain scalability solutions across the industry.
- Successful implementation of these upgrades could lead to increased competition among blockchain platforms, impacting market dynamics.
