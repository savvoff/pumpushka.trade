## Overview

Michael Saylor, a prominent advocate for Bitcoin, has issued a strong message urging individuals and companies to invest in Bitcoin, asserting that fiat money will not rectify itself. His firm, Strategy, continues to purchase Bitcoin even amidst significant unrealized losses, reinforcing Saylor's long-standing belief in Bitcoin as a safeguard against the decline of traditional currencies.

## The Current Situation

Saylor's latest assertion emphasizes the urgency of investing in Bitcoin, framing it as a strategic decision in response to the deteriorating value of fiat currencies. Despite Bitcoin trading below his firm's average purchase price, Strategy has maintained its buying activity. Notably, the firm currently holds 714,644 BTC, with an average cost of $76,056 per coin. Recent filings reveal that Strategy acquired an additional 1,142 BTC in the current month at an average price of approximately $78,815, amounting to around $90 million in new investments.

This aggressive accumulation strategy has resulted in an estimated unrealized loss close to $6 billion, given the current trading levels near $68,000. However, the total reported book value of Strategy's Bitcoin holdings exceeds $54 billion, reflecting nearly six years of consistent accumulation.

The significance of this behavior lies in the broader context of corporate Bitcoin holdings. Reports indicate that public companies collectively possess about 1.13 million BTC, with Strategy accounting for nearly two-thirds of that total. Approximately 200 public firms are known to hold Bitcoin, but the majority of recent purchases have been concentrated among a select few, with Strategy leading the charge.

## Strategic Approach

Saylor's firm is guided by a long-term plan, as detailed in its Q4 2025 filings, which outlines a seven-year roadmap aimed at increasing Bitcoin per share by 2032 through various yield scenarios. The firm's strategy is straightforward: buy during market dips and refrain from selling. This approach is encapsulated in Saylor's repeated mantra of purchasing Bitcoin and holding it indefinitely.

The implications of this strategy are multifaceted. On one hand, it signals a strong commitment to Bitcoin that could encourage other corporations and institutional investors to adopt similar strategies. On the other hand, the concentration of corporate exposure to Bitcoin raises concerns about market fragility. A sudden shift in Strategy's approach could potentially lead to rapid price fluctuations, highlighting the importance of liquidity in the market.

## From author

The landscape of corporate Bitcoin investment is evolving, with Strategy's significant holdings and ongoing purchases shaping market dynamics. Saylor's unwavering belief in Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat currency depreciation presents a compelling narrative for both supporters and critics alike. The tension between corporate responsibility and the pursuit of long-term asset appreciation remains a central theme in the ongoing discourse surrounding Bitcoin investments.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Strategy's dominance in corporate Bitcoin purchases in January accounted for over 90% of new additions, highlighting its influence in the market.
- The concentration of Bitcoin holdings within a few firms raises potential risks, particularly regarding market stability and liquidity.
- Saylor's approach may inspire other companies to adopt similar long-term investment strategies, potentially increasing overall market participation.
- Ongoing debates about governance and corporate responsibility in relation to volatile asset investments are likely to intensify.
- The narrative surrounding Bitcoin as a store of value continues to gain traction, especially among those concerned about the erosion of fiat currencies.
