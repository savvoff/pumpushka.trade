## Overview

XRP has experienced a continued decline, trading below $1.550, and is now attempting a recovery. However, it faces significant resistance levels that may hinder its upward movement. The broader market sentiment reflects similar bearish trends seen in other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## Price Movement and Resistance Levels

XRP's price has extended its losses, trading below the $1.550 mark. Initially, there was a recovery attempt from the $1.50 zone, but the price struggles to maintain momentum as it remains below $1.620 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A key bearish trend line is forming, with resistance noted at $1.6150 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.

The inability to hold above the $1.650 level has led to further declines in XRP's price. The cryptocurrency dropped below both the $1.620 and $1.60 thresholds, entering a short-term bearish zone. A notable drop occurred, with the price even dipping below $1.520, ultimately reaching a low of $1.50. Following this, a recovery attempt saw the price rise above the $1.5750 level, surpassing the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward move from the swing high to the low.

Despite these attempts, XRP continues to trade below the critical resistance levels of $1.620 and $1.650. If the price can break through the $1.650 resistance, it may have the potential to rise towards $1.720, which corresponds to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. Further upward movement would encounter resistance near $1.750, and a clear break above this level might push the price toward $1.780 and beyond.

## Potential for Further Decline

Should XRP fail to overcome the $1.650 resistance zone, another drop may be on the horizon. Initial support is seen near the $1.5760 level, with significant support at $1.550. A downside break and a close below $1.550 could lead to further declines, potentially pushing the price toward $1.5250. The critical support level below this is at $1.50, with further declines possible down to $1.4650.

## Technical Indicators

The hourly MACD for XRP/USD is currently losing momentum in the bearish zone, indicating a potential weakening of the downward trend. The hourly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also positioned below the 50 level, suggesting that the selling pressure remains intact.

### Major Support Levels
- $1.5760

### Major Resistance Levels
