## Overview

Bitcoin has recently experienced a significant decline, reaching a 10-month low during trading in Asia on Monday. This downturn follows a weekend selloff, highlighting the current fragility of market sentiment amid broader economic uncertainties.

## What Happened

This decline coincided with a weekend selloff that raised concerns among investors and traders. The broader market is experiencing turbulence, contributing to the fragile sentiment surrounding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
