## Overview

Payward, the parent company of Kraken, has reported a significant growth in its full-year revenue, achieving a 33% increase. This development is noteworthy as it reflects the company's strategic decision to adopt a multibrand corporate structure, which aims to delineate its consumer products from its infrastructure operations.

## Company Structure and Growth

The separation of consumer products from infrastructure operations allows Payward to tailor its strategies and resources according to the specific demands and dynamics of each segment.

This growth in revenue can be attributed to various factors, including increased user engagement and the overall expansion of the cryptocurrency market. The decision to adopt a multibrand structure may also position Payward to better respond to market changes and consumer needs, contributing to its revenue growth.
