## Overview

Russia's Moscow Exchange (MOEX) is set to expand its offerings in the digital asset space by introducing new indices and futures contracts tied to XRP, Solana, and Tron. This development is significant as it provides traders with novel ways to track price movements without the need to directly own the cryptocurrencies.

## Expansion of Digital Asset Offerings

Recently, Maria Silkina, the head of the derivative products group at MOEX, announced plans for this expansion during a radio broadcast. Currently, the exchange offers indices for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but with the introduction of these new indices, traders will gain access to three additional major cryptocurrencies. The new futures contracts based on these indices will be cash-settled, adhering to the regulatory framework established by the Bank of Russia. Settlements for these contracts will occur monthly.

The interest in trading these digital assets has been notable in other markets, prompting MOEX to tap into this demand. By offering futures contracts tied to XRP, Solana, and Tron, the exchange aims to enhance trading opportunities and provide more tools for market participants.

## Additional Product Developments

In addition to the new indices and futures, MOEX is reportedly considering the introduction of perpetual futures and options for Bitcoin and Ethereum in the future. Perpetual contracts differ from the monthly settled contracts currently in use, as they do not have an expiration date. Instead, they operate using funding rates to remain aligned with the spot market, allowing traders to hold their positions indefinitely. This potential shift indicates MOEX's commitment to diversifying its product offerings while ensuring they remain within a regulated framework.

The exchange's approach to rolling out these products gradually suggests a careful strategy aimed at maintaining compliance with existing regulations while simultaneously allowing for more advanced trading strategies.

## Regulatory Context

The expansion of MOEX's digital asset offerings aligns with broader trends in the Russian financial landscape. Since 2025, the exchange has been progressively adding crypto-linked futures and structured products, including those tied to Bitcoin and Ether. Major Russian financial institutions, such as Sberbank, have also begun to offer investment products linked to cryptocurrency prices, indicating a growing acceptance of digital assets in the country.

Despite these advancements, access to these new instruments is expected to be initially limited to qualified investors. However, the introduction of more trading options is likely to enhance liquidity and provide additional avenues for risk management.

## From author

The introduction of these new indices and futures contracts by MOEX marks a pivotal moment in the Russian crypto market. By expanding the range of digital assets available for trading, the exchange is not only responding to trader demand but also potentially setting the stage for increased institutional participation. The regulatory framework established by the Bank of Russia will play a crucial role in shaping how these products are utilized and the overall growth of the market.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The launch of new indices and futures for XRP, Solana, and Tron could attract new traders and institutional interest in the Russian market.
- Cash-settled contracts may simplify trading operations, reducing the need for custody of the underlying assets.
- Increased liquidity and risk management options may emerge as more instruments become available.
- The gradual rollout of advanced products like perpetual contracts could lead to more sophisticated trading strategies among market participants.
- The regulatory framework from the Bank of Russia will ensure that new offerings remain compliant, potentially fostering confidence among investors.
- Overall, these developments may enhance price discovery for the newly introduced digital assets within Russia.
