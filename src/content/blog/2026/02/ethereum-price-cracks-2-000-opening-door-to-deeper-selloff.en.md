## Overview

Ethereum's price has recently experienced a decline, breaking below the $2,000 mark. This movement signals a potential further drop, with the cryptocurrency consolidating at risk of falling below $1,950 as it struggles to maintain upward momentum.

## Recent Price Movements

Ethereum's price began a new decline after failing to sustain levels above $2,050. It has since traded below both the $2,020 and $2,000 thresholds, entering what is classified as a bearish zone. The price action reflects a broader trend, as Ethereum mimics Bitcoin's recent performance.

The cryptocurrency is currently trading below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, indicating a weakening trend. A bearish trend line has formed, with resistance identified at the $1,980 level on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If Ethereum remains under the $2,020 zone, it may initiate another decline.

Despite the bearish sentiment, there was notable buying activity near the $1,900 level. If buyers remain active above this level, there is potential for a price increase. Immediate resistance is observed around the $1,960 mark, along with the aforementioned trend line. The first key resistance remains at $2,000, followed by a significant level at $2,020.

In the event of a clear breakthrough above $2,020, Ethereum could see an upward movement toward the $2,165 resistance area. Should this upward trajectory continue, it might lead to prices reaching the $2,250 or even $2,280 levels in the near term.

## Potential for Further Losses

Conversely, if Ethereum fails to overcome the $2,000 resistance, it could initiate a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is positioned near the $1,920 level, while a major support area lies around $1,900, coinciding with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the upward move from the $1,745 swing low to the $2,169 high. 

A significant drop below the $1,850 support could lead the price toward the $1,820 support level. Continued losses might further push the price down to the $1,750 region, with a critical support level identified at $1,720.

## Technical Indicators
