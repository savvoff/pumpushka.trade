## Overview

The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing significant turmoil, with heavy capital outflows and large-scale liquidations leading to a notable decline in asset prices. XRP, in particular, has seen a 26.5% drop over the past week, prompting analysts to focus on potential support levels rather than rebound timing.

## Panic-Driven Market Breakdown Keeps XRP Under Pressure

The ongoing selloff in the crypto market reflects a state of broad panic rather than a controlled profit-taking strategy. Within this context, Bitcoin has lost close to 10%, while XRP has faced even steeper losses, approaching 20%. This trend highlights the scale of liquidations affecting altcoin markets. 

Casi, a prominent market analyst, has noted that the current market conditions are characterized by invalidated bullish divergence signals. This indicates that momentum indicators are not confirming any price strength, which is a critical signal that traders often rely on to anticipate potential reversals. Instead of seeing a stabilization in prices, the market continues to decline, suggesting that it is still actively searching for demand.

Panic-driven selling, rather than strategic rotation, is driving prices lower. The rapid nature of price declines, combined with thin bid support, points to forced selling conditions. Until market volatility decreases and divergence structures hold, the likelihood of a sustained recovery for XRP remains uncertain.

## Key Fibonacci Zones Define XRP’s Stabilization Path

Amid this high-pressure environment, Casi has identified specific macro retracement zones where structural support for XRP may emerge. The immediate focus is on the $1.09 region, which aligns with the macro 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. This area is considered deep correction territory, indicating potential stabilization for XRP.

The analysis shows that XRP has breached multiple interim support levels while following a descending trend, which suggests ongoing distribution in the market. The anticipated drop into the 0.786 zone coincides with historical demand clusters, marking a potential area where selling pressure may weaken, allowing buyers to re-enter.

However, it is important to note that the analyst refrained from declaring this level as a definitive bottom. The current price behavior is described as fast and emotionally driven, which often leads to overshoots before the market reaches an equilibrium. In this sense, the $1.09 level is viewed as a structural checkpoint, where stabilization could begin if selling pressure diminishes.

Bitcoin's positioning provides additional macro context for XRP's outlook. The analyst is keeping an eye on $64,500 for Bitcoin, which corresponds with its macro 0.5 Fibonacci retracement. If Bitcoin can secure support at this level, it may provide the necessary cross-market stability for XRP to maintain its deeper retracement zone. Conversely, a failure to hold that support could increase the likelihood of further downside across altcoins.

The emotional nature of trading, combined with external pressures, can result in rapid price fluctuations that challenge even seasoned investors. Analysts are now tasked with identifying potential support levels to navigate this turbulent environment, and the identification of key Fibonacci retracement zones is a pivotal aspect of this analysis.
