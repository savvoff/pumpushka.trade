## Overview

XRP price has encountered significant resistance at the $1.550 mark, leading to a notable decline. Currently, the price is correcting its previous gains and faces challenges in maintaining levels above $1.340. This situation is critical for XRP, as it navigates a declining trend and must contend with various resistance and support levels.

## Recent Price Action

XRP's recent price movement has shown a clear inability to surpass the $1.550 threshold, prompting a downside correction. This decline has seen the price dip below the $1.450 level, indicating a shift into a negative zone. As the price continues to trade below $1.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, it has formed a declining channel with resistance identified at $1.430 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.

The downward trend is not isolated to XRP, as it mirrors the movements of other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP's price has dropped below the $1.50 and $1.480 levels, and it has also crossed below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the upward movement from a previous swing low to a recent high.

Looking ahead, should the price manage to initiate an upward move, it is likely to encounter resistance near the $1.430 level. The first significant resistance above this point is positioned at $1.450, which, if surpassed, could lead to a test of the $1.50 mark. A clear breakout above $1.50 may open the door for further upward movement toward the $1.545 resistance level and potentially higher toward $1.625. However, the bulls will face a substantial hurdle at around $1.720.

## Potential for Further Declines

If XRP fails to breach the resistance zone around $1.50, it is at risk of initiating another decline. Initial support is found near the $1.340 level, coinciding with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent upward movement. Should the price break below this support, the next major support level is around $1.30. A decisive move and close below this level could result in continued downward momentum, possibly leading the price toward the $1.240 area. Further losses could see XRP testing the $1.20 zone, with additional declines leading towards $1.150.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly RSI**: The Relative Strength Index for XRP/USD is positioned below the 50 level, further supporting the bearish outlook.
