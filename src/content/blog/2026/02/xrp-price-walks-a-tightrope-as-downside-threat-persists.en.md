## Overview

XRP's price is currently facing significant downward pressure after failing to surpass a key resistance level. The cryptocurrency has entered a corrective phase, raising concerns about its ability to maintain critical support levels.

## Current Price Movement

XRP's price experienced a notable decline after it could not break through the resistance at $1.4650. Following this, the price corrected downward, dipping below $1.40 and now trading below $1.380. This movement indicates a potential bearish trend, as XRP is also under the influence of a declining channel with resistance forming at approximately $1.3880 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair, as sourced from Kraken.

As the price continues to adjust, it has tested the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the upward movement from the swing low of $1.1356 to the high of $1.5435. Currently, the bulls appear to be active near the $1.340 mark, but the overall market sentiment remains cautious.

If XRP can hold above $1.30, there may be a chance for a recovery; however, the resistance near $1.3880 poses a significant barrier. The first major resistance level is identified at $1.40, which, if cleared, could lead to further testing of the $1.420 mark. A successful move above this level might direct the price toward the $1.450 resistance, with further gains potentially reaching $1.4820. The bulls would likely encounter a major hurdle near the $1.50 level.

Conversely, if XRP fails to overcome the $1.40 resistance zone, it risks initiating a fresh decline. Initial support is observed near $1.340, with the next significant support level at $1.30 or the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.2920. A downside break and close below this level could lead to further declines toward $1.2650, with additional support near the $1.250 zone. If the price drops below this, it could continue to weaken, potentially approaching $1.2250.

## From author

The current price dynamics of XRP reveal a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency. With the price struggling to maintain its position above key support levels, traders and investors are closely watching for signs of either recovery or further decline. The technical indicators suggest that the market sentiment is leaning bearish, which could have significant implications for XRP's future price action.
