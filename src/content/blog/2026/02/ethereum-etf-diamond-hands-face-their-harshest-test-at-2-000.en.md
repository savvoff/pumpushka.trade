## Overview

Ethereum ETF investors are currently facing significant challenges as the price of ETH has dipped substantially from their average entry points. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart highlighted this disparity between Ethereum and Bitcoin ETF investors, marking a troubling period for those holding Ethereum positions.

## Current Situation

According to Seyffart, Ethereum ETF holders find themselves in a more precarious situation than their Bitcoin counterparts. The average cost basis for ETF holders is approximately $3,500, while the current price of ETH is around $2,000. This discrepancy has resulted in many investors being "deep underwater," facing a painful reality as their investments have declined sharply. 

The recent trough for Ethereum ETFs has pushed the drawdown beyond 60%, a level reminiscent of previous declines seen by ETH investors. Despite the severity of this situation, Seyffart noted that the response from investors has been relatively stoic. He pointed out that a significant majority of buyers have chosen to hold onto their investments, indicating a level of resilience among Ethereum ETF holders.

The data indicates a troubling trend in net inflows across the Ethereum ETF sector. Inflows dropped from approximately $15 billion to below $12 billion, a more pronounced decline compared to Bitcoin ETFs. However, Seyffart characterized the current scenario as "fairly decent diamond hands in the grand scheme," suggesting that while the situation is challenging, it isn't unprecedented for Ethereum investors.

Recent data from SoSoValue showed that U.S. spot ether ETFs experienced about $13.82 million in net inflows on February 10, following a week marked by significant net redemptions totaling around $166 million. This outflow streak has continued for several weeks, with monthly figures indicating about $350 million in outflows last month. As of February 10, the total net assets in Ethereum ETFs stand at approximately $11.76 billion.

In a contrasting development, Goldman Sachs recently disclosed its crypto-related positions, revealing an increasing interest in Ethereum alongside Bitcoin. The bank's 13F filing showed about $2.36 billion in crypto exposure, including approximately $1.0 billion tied to spot ether ETFs. This disclosure reflects a growing acceptance of Ethereum within traditional finance, showcasing its potential as a significant investment asset.

## From author

The current predicament of Ethereum ETF investors underscores the volatility and challenges inherent in the cryptocurrency market. While the drawdown is steep, the resilience of many holders suggests a broader confidence in the long-term potential of Ethereum. The contrasting signals from traditional finance, particularly with Goldman Sachs' recent disclosures, may provide a glimmer of hope for Ethereum's future as institutional interest grows.
