## Overview

XRP has recently experienced a significant pullback, drawing attention back to its longer-term price trends. The cryptocurrency is currently down from its July all-time high, and analysts are examining potential accumulation zones as indicators of future price movements.

## Current Price Action and Analysis

XRP's recent price activity has resulted in a decline of over 60% from its peak in July. As the price continues to breach established support levels, analysts are looking for signs that the cryptocurrency may be nearing a bottom. One analyst, who previously forecasted a substantial rally in XRP, indicates that the current price movement suggests an entry into a new accumulation phase.

According to the technical analysis of XRP's price action on a two-week candlestick chart, the cryptocurrency has corrected approximately 58% from its recent peak. This correction has brought XRP's price into what the analyst identifies as the first accumulation zone, which lies between $1.50 and $1.30. The analysis emphasizes that this stage is not about pinpointing an exact bottom but rather about gradually building exposure as the price stabilizes.

The analyst's outlook suggests that XRP's decline may find support between $1.5 and $1.3. This area is viewed as an opportune moment for investors to begin accumulating XRP slowly. However, the analysis also considers a scenario where XRP could experience a deeper decline. If the price were to fall below the $1.30 level, the focus would shift to a secondary accumulation band situated between $0.90 and $0.70. Despite this potential for a lower price range, the analyst maintains that such a movement would not invalidate the overall bullish thesis. Instead, it would represent a significant long-term accumulation opportunity for investors seeking maximum profits.

## Long-Term Projections

While XRP's current price does not seem close to the long-term target of $10, many analysts remain optimistic about the cryptocurrency's future. Despite the immediate caution in the market, long-term projections have not changed significantly. The analyst highlighted their long-term price target of $10, noting that it would be more advantageous to accumulate XRP at lower price points, specifically between $1.50 and $1, rather than at higher levels like $3 or $2. 

To reinforce confidence in this long-term target, the analyst referenced a previous successful cycle call, where XRP was positioned around $0.50 during the last bear market. This setup preceded a substantial rally that saw XRP reach $3.66, yielding impressive gains.

In the past 24 hours, XRP's price has fluctuated, crashing from an intraday high of $1.44 to a low of $1.14, before stabilizing back at $1.30. This price point indicates that XRP is currently 670% away from the projected $10 target.

## From author
