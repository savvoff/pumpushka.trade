## Overview

Jervis Johnson, a veteran designer associated with the Warhammer franchise, has voiced concerns about the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) in creative industries. His remarks come in support of Games Workshop's decision to implement a ban on generative AI, emphasizing the potential negative impact of this technology on creative work.

## Concerns Over AI and Creative Integrity

Jervis Johnson has been a prominent figure in the gaming industry for many years, especially noted for his contributions to the Warhammer series. Recently, he expressed his apprehensions regarding the rise of generative AI technologies, which he believes could jeopardize the integrity of creative endeavors. According to Johnson, the increasing reliance on AI tools threatens to diminish the value of original artistic contributions, potentially leading to a homogenization of creative outputs.

His support for Games Workshop's ban on generative AI reflects a broader concern within the creative community about the implications of such technologies. Johnson argues that AI-generated content can undermine the unique qualities that define individual artistic expression. By producing work that lacks the personal touch and nuanced understanding of human experience, generative AI may dilute the very essence of creativity, according to his perspective.

The move by Games Workshop to prohibit the use of generative AI in its projects is significant, as it highlights a growing recognition among industry leaders of the challenges posed by advancements in technology. This decision not only aims to protect the creative integrity of the Warhammer brand but also serves as a statement about the importance of human creativity in an era increasingly dominated by automated processes.

## From author

The concerns raised by Jervis Johnson regarding AI's role in creative industries resonate with ongoing debates about technology's impact on artistic fields. As AI continues to evolve and integrate into various sectors, the implications for originality and creative expression become increasingly complex. The stance taken by Games Workshop, backed by industry veterans like Johnson, may signal a broader movement towards preserving human creativity in the face of technological advancement.

Johnson's warning about AI becoming the "asbestos of the internet" suggests that, much like asbestos in construction, AI could pose unforeseen risks to the creative landscape if not approached with caution. This metaphor implies that while AI may initially seem beneficial, it could lead to detrimental consequences for creators and the quality of artistic output in the long run.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The discussion around AI's impact on creativity may influence perceptions of AI-related projects in the crypto space, particularly those focused on generative art.
- A growing sentiment against AI-generated content could affect the demand for NFTs and digital art created using AI tools.
- Industry leaders may take similar stances as Games Workshop, leading to increased scrutiny of AI applications in crypto and gaming sectors.
- The emphasis on preserving human creativity could foster innovation in blockchain projects aimed at supporting artists and original content creators.
- A potential divide may emerge between AI-driven projects and traditional creative endeavors, influencing investment and community engagement in the crypto market.
