## Overview

Crypto expert Remi has raised the possibility of XRP achieving a base price of $10,000, citing the potential of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to become a leading network for tokenization. This assertion hinges on the development of a "United States Crypto price Floor System" and the growing utility of XRP through tokenization initiatives.

## Predictions on XRP's Price Potential

In an X post, Remi highlighted that XRP could reach a base price of $10,000 if the U.S. establishes a price floor system for cryptocurrencies. This speculation connects to a broader conversation about the U.S. potentially recognizing XRP as a critical asset. The expert emphasized that the XRP Ledger's role in tokenizing gold and Bitcoin could significantly enhance XRP's utility, contributing to the anticipated price increase.

Furthermore, Remi mentioned that all critical minerals would be tokenized on the XRPL, positioning XRP as a bridge currency in these transactions. He reiterated that the altcoin could see substantial price milestones, including $1,000, $10,000, and even $100,000, as these tokenization efforts gain traction.

The XRPL is already witnessing a surge in the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). Recently, Billiton Diamond and Ctrl Alt announced the successful tokenization of over $280 million in certified polished diamonds, with Ripple providing custody services for this initiative. Current data from RWA.xyz indicates that the total value of tokenized assets on the XRPL is approximately $1.9 billion, ranking it sixth among all networks in terms of tokenized RWAs.

## Recent Developments on the XRP Ledger

The XRP Ledger has also activated the Permissioned Decentralized Exchange (DEX), facilitating compliant institutional trading. This upgrade is expected to enhance the network's adoption, which would be beneficial for XRP. Expert X Finance Bull noted that regulated institutions can now engage in trading on the network with vetted counterparties, leading to compliant decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions, on-chain order books, and KYC-gated trading.

X Finance Bull emphasized that Ripple and its partner institutions have been preparing for this upgrade, asserting that the necessary infrastructure is now in place and payment rails are open. He suggested that this development could lead to trillions of dollars entering the XRP Ledger ecosystem.

Additionally, X Finance Bull mentioned that the potential signing of the CLARITY Act into law could serve as a bullish catalyst for XRP, predicting increased institutional inflows into the XRP ecosystem once this occurs.

## From author

The discussions surrounding XRP's potential price trajectory and the developments within the XRP Ledger highlight a growing interest in the tokenization of assets and the role of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance. The assertion of a significant price milestone, while speculative, reflects the optimism within the crypto community about the future utility of XRP and the XRPL.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The potential establishment of a U.S. price floor for cryptocurrencies could influence the regulatory landscape and market perceptions of digital assets.
- The tokenization of critical minerals and other real-world assets on the XRPL may drive further adoption of XRP as a bridge currency.
- Institutional trading capabilities through the Permissioned DEX could attract significant capital inflows into the XRP ecosystem.
- The ongoing development of compliant DeFi solutions may enhance the legitimacy and use cases for XRP in traditional finance.
- The anticipated effects of the CLARITY Act could catalyze increased institutional participation in the crypto market, particularly for XRP.
