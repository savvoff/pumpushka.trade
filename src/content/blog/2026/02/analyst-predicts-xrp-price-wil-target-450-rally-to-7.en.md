## Overview

Crypto analyst Diana has forecasted a potential rally for XRP, suggesting that the altcoin could reach a price of $7, which would represent a significant gain. This prediction is based on technical analysis, including Elliott Wave and Fibonacci levels, indicating that XRP is currently at a critical support zone.

## XRP Price Prediction and Technical Analysis

In a recent post, Diana outlined her analysis of XRP's price movements. She noted that the altcoin is currently situated in a vital support zone between $1.50 and $1.55. This region is crucial for buyers, as maintaining this support could enable a price increase to levels between $1.88 and $2. Diana also indicated that if the support holds, the price chart could open up rapidly, leading to further gains.

Diana provided a detailed short-term, medium-term, and long-term outlook for XRP. In the short term, she anticipates a breakout above $2, which could propel XRP to a range between $2.20 and $2.70. This movement would signify the completion of the current local wave. For the medium-term outlook, Diana suggested that XRP's price structure appears to be in the early stages of a larger Wave 5 impulse, following lows observed in 2025 to 2026. She utilized Fibonacci extensions and channel projections to identify a major target within the $5 to $8 range, with $7 emerging as a realistic cycle high.

Moreover, Diana mentioned the possibility of XRP reaching this target within the next four to eight months if the momentum remains favorable. She speculated that bullish scenarios could see XRP peaking between June and October 2026.

## Insights from CasiTrades

Another analyst, CasiTrades, has shared her insights regarding XRP's price movements. She believes that a Wave 4 relief move is imminent, given that XRP has maintained its current support effectively. CasiTrades identified the first resistance level at $1.78, which corresponds with a prior support breakdown.

She pointed out that the previous Wave 2 move was shallow, with XRP retracing only to the 0.382 level. In Elliott Wave theory, shallow Wave 2 movements often precede deeper Wave 4 retraces. Consequently, she posited that the Wave 4 move could push XRP higher, potentially reaching levels around $1.93 or even the $2.03 macro 0.5 retracement level. CasiTrades emphasized the importance of reclaiming and holding the $2.03 level as support, as failure to do so could result in another downward wave towards $1.55 or lower, jeopardizing the Wave 5 structure.

As of the latest updates, XRP is trading around $1.58, experiencing a decline over the past 24 hours.
