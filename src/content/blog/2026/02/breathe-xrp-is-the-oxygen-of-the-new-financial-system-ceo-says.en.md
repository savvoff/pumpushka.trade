## Overview

XRP is increasingly being recognized not just as a cryptocurrency for trading, but as a fundamental component of a new financial ecosystem. The discussions are shifting towards its potential use as reliable collateral and settlement solutions for on-chain assets, as experts highlight its critical role in real-world finance.

## XRP's Evolving Role in Finance

Recent commentary from industry leaders indicates a significant change in the perception of XRP. Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group, emphasized that XRP should be viewed as foundational collateral rather than merely a speculative asset. He described it as “the most pristine collateral” available, suggesting that many holders may not fully understand its value. This perspective aligns with broader trends among developers and institutional players who are exploring the practical applications of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for financial transactions.

The XRP Ledger has seen an increase in tokenized commodities, reportedly hosting around $1.14 billion in these assets. This development illustrates that companies are actively utilizing the ledger for tangible assets, such as energy-linked tokens and diamonds. This positions XRPL as a significant player in the tokenized commodity space, closely following Ethereum. The implication of this shift is profound, as it suggests that XRP could play a key role in future settlement and collateral processes.

## Ripple's Institutional Focus

Ripple is preparing the XRPL for deeper institutional engagement, as indicated by its strategic roadmap. The introduction of permissioned domains and credentialing systems aims to facilitate compliance and KYC processes for regulated firms. This focus on institutional DeFi may enhance the usability of XRP by making it more accessible for banks and other financial institutions.

Market reactions to these developments have been notable. Following a decline to about $1.11, XRP experienced a recovery, climbing back to approximately $1.53. This recovery, representing over a 35% increase from its recent low, highlights the impact of renewed institutional interest and accumulation by significant wallets. However, it is essential to recognize that broader macroeconomic factors and global risk sentiment continue to influence daily market fluctuations.

## Institutional Preparations for On-Chain Credit

Reports suggest that early institutional adopters are poised to invest capital in XRPL to enhance yield and liquidity. Proposed features such as a permissioned decentralized exchange (DEX), confidential transfer options, and advanced escrow controls are designed to integrate more seamlessly with existing financial processes. Should these features be implemented and adopted, XRP's role as a liquidity provider and settlement asset could be solidified.

## From author

The evolving narrative around XRP reflects a significant transition in how cryptocurrencies are being perceived and utilized within the financial sector. As XRP positions itself as a crucial element in the new financial landscape, it is essential to monitor both technological developments and market dynamics. The potential for XRP to serve as the "oxygen" of a new financial system hinges not only on its technological capabilities but also on its acceptance and integration by traditional financial institutions.

## Impact on the crypto market

- XRP is gaining traction as a foundational asset for real-world finance, shifting focus from speculative trading.
