## Overview

Aster has recently transitioned to a crypto perpetual futures decentralized exchange, marking a significant rebranding effort. This move comes as the trading volume for perpetual decentralized exchanges has surged dramatically, reaching trillions of dollars. The testnet for Aster's layer-1 blockchain has now gone live, with plans for a mainnet rollout expected in the first quarter of the upcoming year.

## What Happened

Aster's rebranding reflects a strategic shift towards the growing market for perpetual futures trading, which has seen exponential growth. This shift is crucial as it positions Aster to capitalize on the increasing demand for decentralized trading solutions. The launch of the layer-1 blockchain testnet is a pivotal step in this process, allowing developers and users to interact with the network and test its functionalities before the mainnet launch.

The decision to focus on perpetual futures trading aligns Aster with current trends in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Perpetual futures contracts have gained popularity due to their unique features, such as the ability to trade without an expiration date and the potential for significant leverage. This has led to a surge in trading volume across various platforms, indicating a robust interest from traders and investors.

The anticipated mainnet rollout in the first quarter is particularly significant, as it promises to deliver a fully operational platform for users to engage in perpetual futures trading. This phase will allow Aster to showcase its technological advancements and attract a wider user base, further amplifying its presence in the competitive DeFi landscape.
