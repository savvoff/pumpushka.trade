## Overview

XRP has recently regained a position above $1.40 after a period of fluctuating trading activity. Some investors are optimistic that this recovery could signal the beginning of a more significant upward trend. Commentary from a European investment executive has reignited discussions about potential price targets for the token.

## Bold Forecasts From A German Investor

During a recent appearance on Der Aktionär TV, Michel Oliver, head of Tokentus Investment AG, made a notable prediction regarding XRP's future value. He suggested that the token could reach between $7 and $9 in a forthcoming bull cycle. Oliver’s forecast is tied to the increasing institutional adoption of the XRP network and its perceived expanding role in global payment systems. He indicated that if the current pace of adoption continues, XRP could become a fundamental asset for settlement purposes.

Oliver emphasized that the growth of XRP's value should be attributed to the underlying infrastructure rather than fleeting market excitement. He pointed out that Ripple, the company behind XRP, is establishing a strong foundation through various licensing achievements and partnerships, which could enable larger transaction volumes over time. However, he cautioned that this growth might not manifest in the current market phase, suggesting that a more significant upward movement in price may follow a reset in market sentiment.

## Licenses And Network Expansion

Ripple's progress in securing regulatory approvals has been noteworthy. Reports indicate that the company has obtained over 60 financial licenses globally, including an electronic money license in the United Kingdom. This particular license allows Ripple to provide regulated payment services within the UK, contributing to its expanding regulatory footprint. This growth in licensing has been cited as a factor for long-term optimism surrounding XRP.

The XRP Ledger, the underlying blockchain technology, was designed to facilitate fast and low-cost transactions, with XRP serving as the medium for these transactions. The expectation is that as more institutions integrate with this ledger, the demand for XRP could increase. However, it is essential to note that an increase in institutional participation does not automatically guarantee a rise in value. 

## European Access Broadens

Access to XRP has been enhanced within Europe, particularly through the crypto exchange Safello, which has expanded its services to more European Union countries. This expansion follows Safello receiving authorization under the Markets in Crypto-Assets framework, allowing it to support XRP trading since December 2025. Greater availability of XRP can lead to improved liquidity and attract new participants to the market. However, it is important to recognize that mere exchange listings do not typically drive substantial price increases.

Currently, XRP appears to be in a phase of rebuilding. Investors are monitoring the growth in licensing and potential inflows from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as early indicators of market strength. Nevertheless, some remain cautious, emphasizing that infrastructure advancements must ultimately translate into sustained demand.

## From author

The discussions surrounding XRP's potential future price are indicative of the broader speculative nature of cryptocurrency markets. The optimism expressed by investment executives highlights the ongoing interest in XRP's role in the evolving financial landscape. However, the inherent volatility and uncertainty in the market mean that investors should approach such forecasts with caution.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The discussion of XRP's potential price targets could influence investor sentiment and market dynamics.
- Increased regulatory approvals for Ripple may enhance institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency sector.
- Greater access to XRP in Europe could lead to improved liquidity and market participation.
- The focus on infrastructure and partnerships may shift investor attention from short-term price movements to long-term growth potential.
- The outcome of ongoing market cycles will be crucial in determining whether ambitious price forecasts become reality.
