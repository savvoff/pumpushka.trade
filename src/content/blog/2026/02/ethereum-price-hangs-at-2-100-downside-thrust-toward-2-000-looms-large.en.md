## Overview

Ethereum's price has recently experienced a notable decline, falling below key support levels and struggling to regain upward momentum. Currently, the price hovers around $2,100, presenting challenges for recovery as it faces significant resistance.

## Recent Price Movements

Ethereum's price trajectory has been downward, with the cryptocurrency failing to maintain stability above the $2,250 mark. Following this failure, Ethereum extended its losses, dropping below $2,200 and entering a bearish phase. The price dipped even further, reaching a low of $2,073 before attempting a recovery.

As of now, Ethereum is trading below the $2,200 threshold and also sits beneath the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A major bearish trend line is forming with a resistance point at $2,255 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. This trend indicates that the market sentiment remains bearish, particularly if the price continues to stay below the $2,320 zone.

Despite a brief recovery above $2,120, Ethereum's price remains significantly below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward move from a swing high of $3,040 to the low of $2,073. The immediate resistance is observed near the $2,200 level, while the first key resistance lies at around $2,250, coinciding with the bearish trend line.

Should Ethereum manage to break above the $2,250 resistance level, it could aim for further gains. The next key resistance is positioned at $2,390, and a clear move above this point might lead the price toward the $2,550 resistance or the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward movement from the previous swing high.

## Potential for Further Declines

If Ethereum fails to overcome the $2,250 resistance, it may initiate another decline. Initial support is identified near the $2,100 mark, followed closely by the $2,075 zone. A decisive move below this latter support could trigger further downward momentum, potentially pushing the price toward the $2,050 level. Any additional losses might see Ethereum testing the $2,000 region, with the main support level being around $1,880.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for ETH/USD is currently gaining momentum in the bearish zone, indicating a prevailing negative trend.
- **Hourly RSI**: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for ETH/USD is positioned below the 50 level, further confirming the bearish sentiment in the market.

## From author

The current situation for Ethereum reflects a challenging market environment where the cryptocurrency struggles to maintain upward momentum. The presence of significant resistance levels and bearish indicators suggests that traders should be cautious as the potential for further declines looms. Observing the behavior around key support and resistance levels will be crucial for understanding the next movements in Ethereum's price.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Ethereum's struggle to maintain above $2,200 may influence overall market sentiment, potentially leading to increased bearish activity.
- A failure to recover above critical resistance levels could signal a broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market.
- Traders may become more risk-averse, impacting trading volumes and liquidity across major exchanges.
- Continued pressure on Ethereum may lead to increased scrutiny and analysis of other cryptocurrencies, particularly those closely correlated with ETH.
- The technical indicators suggest a cautious approach, as bearish momentum could lead to a broader market correction if other cryptocurrencies follow suit.
