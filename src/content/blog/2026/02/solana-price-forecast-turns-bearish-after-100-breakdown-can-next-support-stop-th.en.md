## Overview

Solana's price has recently faced significant downward pressure, notably breaking below a critical psychological threshold of $100. This decline has shifted market focus from potential recovery strategies to more immediate damage control, raising concerns about the token's future performance.

## Recent Price Movements and Market Context

As Solana's price dipped to approximately $98, it marked the lowest level seen in nearly ten months. Over the past week, the token has experienced losses nearing 20%, with a monthly decline of around 25%. This downturn has coincided with a reduction in trading activity, as both spot volume and derivatives participation have diminished. Data indicates a decrease in open interest, suggesting that traders are unwinding long positions, rather than engaging in aggressive short selling.

This trend has not occurred in isolation; a widespread wave of liquidations across the market over the weekend, combined with thin liquidity conditions, has exacerbated the downward momentum seen in major cryptocurrencies. Additionally, macroeconomic factors have contributed to a bearish sentiment, particularly following the nomination of an individual perceived as hawkish to lead the Federal Reserve.

## Technical Analysis of Solana

From a technical standpoint, Solana's market structure has shown signs of weakness. The recent drop below $100 has confirmed a pattern of lower highs and lower lows, with the price currently positioned well below declining short-term moving averages. The widening of Bollinger Bands indicates that downward momentum remains strong, with the price action close to the lower band.

Momentum indicators further reinforce the prevailing pressure, as the daily relative strength index has fallen to approximately 25, placing Solana deep within oversold territory. While this condition may increase the likelihood of short-term price recoveries, it does not inherently signal a reversal of the broader trend.

Traders are now closely monitoring support levels, particularly the $95 area, followed by a broader range from $92 to $90. Should the price decline further, significant historical support levels at $85 and $80 may come into play. Some analyses suggest that if selling pressure intensifies, thinner support could expose deeper price zones later in the year.

## Market Fundamentals Despite Weakness

Even amidst the bearish price outlook, Solana's underlying network metrics appear relatively robust. Transaction counts surged in January, indicating a notable increase in on-chain activity and stablecoin usage. While institutional interest has been mixed—with earlier inflows countered by more recent outflows from Solana ETFs—there remains a foundation of activity that could influence future price movements.

For Solana to alleviate the current bearish pressure, it would need to reclaim the $110 level and sustain trading above key moving averages. Until such a recovery occurs, any price rallies are likely to be interpreted as corrective movements within an overarching downtrend, leaving the market's immediate focus on upcoming support levels.

## From author

The current situation surrounding Solana illustrates the challenges faced by cryptocurrencies in a volatile market. The interplay of technical indicators, market sentiment, and macroeconomic factors will likely determine the token's trajectory in the coming weeks. Investors should remain cautious, keeping an eye on support levels while also considering the underlying fundamentals that may influence future price recovery.
