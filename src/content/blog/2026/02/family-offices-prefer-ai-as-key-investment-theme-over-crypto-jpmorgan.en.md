## Overview

A recent poll conducted by JPMorgan highlights a significant trend among family offices regarding their investment preferences. The survey reveals that a substantial majority of these investment entities are steering clear of cryptocurrencies, with a notable preference for artificial intelligence (AI) as a key investment theme.

## Survey Findings

According to the polling data from JPMorgan, almost 89% of the family offices surveyed reported having no exposure to cryptocurrencies. This statistic underscores a prevailing sentiment within this sector, indicating a cautious approach towards digital assets. Furthermore, for those few family offices that do engage with cryptocurrencies, their average allocations remain minimal, with investments in digital assets and Bitcoin averaging well below 1%.

This trend is particularly relevant as family offices typically possess significant financial resources and often seek to diversify their portfolios across various asset classes. Their reluctance to invest in cryptocurrencies may reflect broader concerns about the volatility and regulatory uncertainties surrounding digital currencies. Instead, family offices appear to be gravitating towards sectors they perceive as more stable and promising, such as artificial intelligence.

The preference for AI over cryptocurrencies highlights a shift in investment priorities. Family offices are likely attracted to the potential of AI technologies to drive innovation and growth across multiple industries. As AI continues to evolve and integrate into various sectors, its perceived value as an investment may overshadow the allure of the cryptocurrency market, which has faced various challenges in recent years.

## From author

The findings from JPMorgan's survey paint a clear picture of the current investment landscape among family offices. The overwhelming lack of interest in cryptocurrencies suggests that many investors are prioritizing traditional or emerging technologies that promise more consistent returns. This trend could have lasting implications for the cryptocurrency market, as family offices typically play a significant role in shaping market dynamics.

As family offices continue to favor sectors such as artificial intelligence, it raises questions about the future growth potential of cryptocurrencies. The lack of substantial investment from these entities could lead to a slowdown in market activity and hinder the overall maturation of the crypto ecosystem.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The significant percentage of family offices with no crypto exposure may indicate a broader hesitance among institutional investors towards digital assets.
- Minimal average allocations to cryptocurrencies suggest that family offices are not viewing digital assets as a core component of their investment strategies.
- The preference for AI over cryptocurrencies could lead to increased capital flow into technology sectors perceived as more stable and innovative.
- This trend may contribute to ongoing volatility in the cryptocurrency market as institutional interest remains subdued.
- The findings could prompt cryptocurrency advocates to reassess their strategies to attract more traditional investors and family offices.
