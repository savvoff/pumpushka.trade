## Overview

OKX Ventures has announced a strategic partnership with Hamilton Lane and Securitize to launch a new stablecoin backed by real-world assets (RWA). This initiative will be implemented on OKX's Ethereum-compatible layer-2 blockchain, known as X Layer. The collaboration aims to leverage the strengths of each company to create a stablecoin that combines the benefits of blockchain technology with the stability of tangible assets.

## Partnership Details

The partnership brings together three prominent entities in the financial and blockchain sectors. OKX Ventures, a well-known venture capital arm of the OKX cryptocurrency exchange, is focused on supporting innovative projects in the blockchain ecosystem. Hamilton Lane is recognized for its expertise in private markets and investment management, while Securitize specializes in digital asset securities and compliance solutions.

The introduction of an RWA-backed stablecoin is significant because it represents a convergence of traditional finance and cryptocurrency. By backing the stablecoin with real-world assets, the project aims to provide a more stable and reliable digital currency option for users. This approach is particularly relevant in the current market environment, where volatility in cryptocurrencies has led to increased demand for stable and reliable financial instruments.

The stablecoin will be built on the X Layer, which is OKX’s Ethereum-compatible layer-2 blockchain. This platform is designed to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs, making it an attractive option for developers and users alike. The choice of X Layer for this stablecoin aligns with the growing trend of utilizing layer-2 solutions to improve the efficiency of blockchain transactions.

The collaboration reflects a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market where traditional financial institutions are increasingly engaging with blockchain technology. By incorporating real-world assets into the stablecoin, the partnership aims to bridge the gap between traditional and digital finance, potentially attracting a wider audience to the cryptocurrency space.
