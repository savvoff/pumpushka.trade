## Overview

LayerZero Labs has announced the upcoming launch of its new blockchain, named "Zero," which is set to debut in the fall of 2026. The project has garnered support from notable entities, including Citadel and ARK. LayerZero Labs asserts that Zero will be capable of processing up to two million transactions per second by utilizing advanced technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs and Jolt.

## The Launch of Zero

LayerZero's Zero chain aims to address scalability issues that many existing blockchains face. The promise of two million transactions per second positions Zero as a potentially transformative player in the blockchain space. This capability is made possible through the implementation of zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic technique that enhances privacy and efficiency in transaction processing, as well as the integration of Jolt, a technology designed to improve transaction throughput.

The backing from prominent financial institutions such as Citadel and ARK adds significant credibility to the project. Citadel, known for its quantitative trading and investment strategies, and ARK, recognized for its focus on disruptive innovation, suggest that Zero may attract attention from both institutional and retail investors alike. Their involvement indicates a strong belief in the technological advancements that Zero aims to deliver and the potential impact on the broader blockchain ecosystem.

The launch timeline set for the fall of 2026 indicates that LayerZero Labs is taking a deliberate approach to development, allowing ample time for testing and refinement. This time frame may also allow for the evolution of market conditions and technological advancements, ensuring that Zero can meet the demands of users and developers when it finally goes live.
