## Overview

The tech billionaire recently announced that X Money is set to launch in a limited beta phase within the next one to two months. This initiative is part of a broader strategy aimed at developing an "everything app" that integrates various functionalities for users.

## Launch of X Money

During a recent discussion, the tech billionaire highlighted the upcoming launch of X Money, which is expected to enter a limited beta phase.
