## Overview

Citadel Securities has partnered with LayerZero to launch a new permissionless blockchain aimed at addressing the scalability and coordination challenges that have hindered previous institutional blockchain initiatives.

Citadel Securities' involvement lends credibility to the initiative and may encourage other financial institutions to explore similar avenues.

Secondly, addressing scalability and coordination issues is crucial for the successful integration of blockchain technology into institutional practices. As financial markets continue to evolve, the ability to process transactions quickly and efficiently will be paramount. The new permissionless chain could serve as a model for future developments in the space, potentially leading to broader adoption of blockchain solutions across various sectors.
