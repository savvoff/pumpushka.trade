## Overview

China is intensifying its scrutiny on public Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization with the aim of preventing capital flight, while simultaneously favoring state-run blockchains over open crypto networks. In the midst of these regulatory changes, LiquidChain is progressing with its presale, raising significant funds, which indicates a strong market demand for solutions that address cross-chain challenges.

## China's Regulatory Landscape

Recent actions by China's regulatory bodies, including the People's Bank of China, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Public Security, indicate a renewed crackdown on public tokenization practices. This regulatory stance is a response to concerns regarding capital flight, which the government perceives as a potential breach of its capital control regime. The regulators are particularly wary of permissionless RWAs, such as tokenized bonds, real estate, or commodities, which could allow investors to bypass restrictions by purchasing assets on public blockchains like Ethereum.

As a result, the Chinese government is promoting a model of "compliant, permissioned tokenization" that operates solely on state-sanctioned platforms, such as the Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN). This shift effectively creates a divide between the permissioned blockchain ecosystem favored by Beijing and the open, permissionless crypto economy that thrives elsewhere. This divergence is leading to a "Splinternet" of value, where China maintains a closed, state-controlled digital environment while the rest of the world operates within a more open and chaotic framework.

## LiquidChain's Response

In this context, LiquidChain is positioning itself as a solution to the challenges posed by regulatory fragmentation. The protocol integrates Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana into a single execution layer, allowing developers to deploy applications once and reach users across multiple platforms. This innovation addresses the issue of fragmented liquidity that can arise due to regulatory barriers and technical incompatibilities.

LiquidChain's presale has reportedly raised over $530,000, indicating a robust interest in infrastructure that tackles cross-chain friction. The current presale price is set at $0.01355, reflecting investor confidence in the long-term viability of cross-chain interoperability. This presale performance suggests that market participants are increasingly valuing utility-driven solutions, as opposed to speculative assets.

## From author

The evolving regulatory landscape in China presents both challenges and opportunities for the crypto market. While the tightening of regulations may hinder certain aspects of tokenization, it simultaneously underscores the importance of interoperability solutions like LiquidChain. By offering a unified layer for cross-chain transactions, LiquidChain aims to bridge the gap created by regulatory barriers, potentially redefining how digital assets are interacted with globally.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased scrutiny in China highlights the necessity for robust, compliant infrastructure in the crypto space.
- The divergence between Eastern and Western regulatory approaches could lead to a bifurcated market environment.
- LiquidChain's presale success signals a strong demand for solutions that facilitate cross-chain liquidity.
- The focus on permissioned tokenization in China may drive innovation in privacy and compliance technologies.
- The emergence of interoperability protocols like LiquidChain could reshape the landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi) by providing essential connectivity across different blockchains.
