## Overview

A crypto analyst known for his accurate predictions regarding Solana's price movements has returned with a new analysis after his previous call proved correct. The analyst, referred to as Crypto Patel, has identified potential new trading opportunities for Solana, contingent upon the cryptocurrency's ability to hold specific price levels.

## Recent Developments

Crypto Patel initially alerted traders to sell their holdings of Solana when the price was near its cycle top, which he identified as being between $250 and $200. Following this advice, Solana's price indeed declined sharply, reaching a low near $67 after peaking around $295, marking a significant drop of 77% from its previous high. 

In his recent commentary, Crypto Patel emphasizes that Solana is currently testing the $85 price level, which aligns with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement on the chart. This level has provided temporary support; however, the overall trend of lower highs since the peak indicates a structurally weak position. The analyst warns that if Solana cannot maintain the $85 level, it could potentially fall into the $50 to $30 range, extending its decline over the past two years. He has categorized this lower range as a strong Fair Value Gap (FVG) accumulation zone, based on historical demand and trading volume patterns.

The analyst also referenced previous price movements, noting that Solana has experienced significant surges in the past. In the 2021 bull cycle, for instance, Solana's price increased dramatically, followed by a substantial correction in the following year. Crypto Patel's current outlook suggests that Solana is in a similar phase of expansion and correction. He predicts that a correction could see prices declining by nearly 89% by mid-2026, following a substantial rise of over 3,699% in 2024.

Despite the bearish short-term forecast, Crypto Patel maintains a long-term bullish perspective for Solana. He believes that once the current corrective phase concludes, Solana could aim for price targets between $500 and $1,000. His analysis projects a sharp upward movement towards $1,000 by 2027, which would represent a significant increase from current levels. Furthermore, he anticipates that if Solana reaches $1,000, it could continue to rise steadily towards a target of $9,270 by late 2029, indicating an extraordinary potential rally.

His analysis serves as a reminder of the importance of technical indicators and historical price patterns in forecasting future movements. As Solana navigates through its current price challenges, the focus on key support levels will be critical for traders and investors alike. 

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- The prediction of a potential decline in Solana's price may influence trader sentiment and lead to increased caution in the market.
