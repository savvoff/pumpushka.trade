## Overview

Dogecoin has experienced a notable decline, trading below a key psychological level against the US Dollar. The cryptocurrency is currently facing significant resistance while holding onto critical support levels, indicating potential for further price movements in the near future.

## Current Situation

Recently, Dogecoin began a downside correction after failing to surpass the $0.1020 mark. This downward trend saw the price drop below the $0.10 and $0.0980 levels, with a notable move falling below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of a previous upward movement. As a result, Dogecoin is trading below the $0.10 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average.

The formation of a key declining channel has been observed, with resistance set at $0.0935 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD trading pair. Currently, the price is holding the $0.0885 support level, which is essential for any potential recovery. If Dogecoin can maintain stability above $0.0880, it may aim for a fresh increase.

Immediate resistance is noted near the $0.0935 level, while the $0.0950 and $0.10 levels serve as major resistance points for bullish movements. Should the price manage to close above the $0.10 resistance, it could potentially lead to further increases toward higher levels.

Conversely, if Dogecoin fails to rise above the $0.10 mark, it may continue to decline. The initial downside support is near $0.0885, which coincides with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the prior upward move. Additional support levels are located around $0.0850 and the main support at $0.080. A significant break below the $0.080 support could trigger further declines, with potential targets noted at lower levels.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD indicator for DOGE/USD is showing increasing momentum in the bearish zone, suggesting a prevailing downward trend.
- **Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: The RSI for DOGE/USD is currently below the 50 level, indicating bearish sentiment among traders.
