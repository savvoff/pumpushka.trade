## Overview

Bitcoin has recently swept through the sell-side liquidity that had accumulated below the market, pushing its price into a deep demand zone. This movement is significant as it raises questions about whether this level will elicit a strong buyer response or signal the beginning of a more extensive market reset.

## Bitcoin's Current Market Position

As Bitcoin's price action unfolds, the focus is now on the implications of this recent drop into a significant demand zone. The completion of the downside move has led to speculation about the potential for a meaningful reaction from buyers in this area. 

### Importance of the 100-Week Simple Moving Average

A cryptocurrency analyst has highlighted that accumulating Bitcoin below the 100-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) has consistently proven to be a sound long-term investment strategy. This specific zone has historically been associated with periods of maximum pessimism in the market, where the risk-to-reward ratio heavily favors patient buyers rather than those looking for quick gains. 

The analyst also mentions a personal strategy that avoids trying to pinpoint the market bottom. Instead, they advocate for steady accumulation by placing buy orders across a range of prices, supported by regular daily purchases. For more conservative investors, waiting for confirmation of upward movement may also yield effective results. 

Historically, Bitcoin's price has never dropped below the previous cycle’s 100-week SMA, establishing this level as a crucial structural support. Investors who have adhered to this strategy in prior market cycles are currently benefiting from significant long-term profits.

### Breakdown and Market Dynamics

According to the latest BTC Heatmap update, the market has followed a previously outlined trajectory. The failure of local lows to hold, combined with weak reactions in trading activity, indicated that the liquidity beneath the market would act as a magnet. This structural weakness led to a continuation of the downside move, which was anticipated.

The analyst notes that Bitcoin is currently trading within a cluster of stronger buy orders situated around the low-$70,000 region. This area is identified as the first point where a "real reaction" is likely to manifest due to the concentration of buy-side interest. The sweep into these deeper liquidity pockets was seen as a necessary event to reach this primary demand zone.

With the anticipated downside fully realized, the immediate focus for analysts and investors now shifts to the response from buyers at this level. With liquidity targets hit and the price resting on significant support, close monitoring is required to determine whether this zone will serve as the foundation for the next upward trend.

The interplay between liquidity, demand zones, and historical price patterns offers a complex landscape for traders and holders alike.
