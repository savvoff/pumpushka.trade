## Overview

SBI Holdings, a financial group based in Japan, has introduced a new on-chain bond that enables ordinary investors to gain exposure to XRP while operating within the country's regulated financial framework. This initiative aims to integrate digital assets into traditional financial products, enhancing their appeal to retail investors.

## SBI Holdings Launches Tokenized Bonds

SBI Holdings has launched an on-chain bond issuance totaling 10 billion yen. This bond is notable for being recorded, issued, and managed on a blockchain system, departing from the conventional securities infrastructure typically used in bond markets. Known informally as “SBI Start Bonds,” these tokenized bonds are being issued on a platform called ibet for Fin, developed by BoosTry, which specializes in registering and managing securities on-chain.

Investors who participate in this offering will receive XRP at the time their purchases are cleared. In addition, SBI Holdings has planned to distribute further XRP benefits during interest payment dates extending through 2029. This structure aims to provide investors not only with fixed-income payouts but also with rewards in the form of cryptocurrency.

## Trading Mechanism and Eligibility

The trading of these security tokens is set to occur on a proprietary platform operated by Osaka Digital Exchange. Secondary market trading is expected to commence on March 25, 2026. Reports suggest that the bonds will yield a modest return, with some sources indicating an indicative coupon range in the low single digits, effectively blending traditional fixed-income returns with the innovative aspect of crypto rewards.

The eligibility criteria for investors are stringent. Only domestic residents who hold an account with SBI VC Trade can claim the XRP benefits associated with these bonds. There is a procedural deadline for completing the necessary steps to receive the benefits by mid-May. Thus, this offering is tailored specifically for onshore retail investors in Japan and is not accessible to a global audience.

## Market Reaction and Implications

Market reactions to this bond issuance have been mixed. Some analysts believe that the structure could stimulate demand for XRP, as SBI Holdings will need to procure the token for distribution and future payouts. However, others note that while the initial offering of approximately 64.5 million dollars is relatively small compared to the overall crypto market, its significance lies in its representation of a mainstream financial institution integrating a digital asset into a regulated bond product. This could encourage other Japanese firms to explore similar ventures.

## From author

The launch of SBI Holdings' tokenized bonds is a significant step toward bridging traditional finance and digital assets. By offering a regulated product that rewards investors with cryptocurrency, SBI Holdings is paving the way for other financial institutions to consider similar initiatives. This move could enhance the legitimacy of digital assets in traditional finance and stimulate interest among retail investors.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Introduction of regulated tokenized bonds could enhance the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies in traditional finance.
- Potential increase in XRP demand due to the structured payouts and rewards in the bond offering.
- Encouragement for other financial institutions in Japan to explore similar tokenization projects.
- Establishment of a new trading platform for security tokens may create additional market opportunities.
- The blending of fixed-income returns with cryptocurrency rewards could attract a new demographic of investors.
