## Overview

The prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced a notable rebound from their recent lows, instilling a sense of optimism among investors. This recovery is attributed to significant accumulation by both retail and institutional players, alongside renewed inflows into cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

## Price Recovery and Accumulation

Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown impressive price increases from their lows, reportedly around $60,000 and $1,900, respectively. Bitcoin's price surged to as high as $71,000, generating bullish sentiment among market participants who believe that the downturn to $60,000 may have marked the bottom. The price recovery has been fueled by substantial accumulation from various investors.

Recent data from the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain highlighted the actions of two whales who have been actively buying Bitcoin and Ethereum. These whales created new wallets and withdrew 3,500 BTC, valued at $249 million, and 30,000 ETH, worth $63 million, from Binance. These withdrawals suggest a long-term holding strategy for these assets.

Additionally, the rebound in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices has been supported by renewed inflows into their respective ETFs. According to SoSoValue data, Bitcoin ETFs recorded a daily net inflow of $145 million, continuing the positive trend from the previous Friday when they received $371 million, following a series of three days of outflows. Ethereum ETFs also saw a turnaround with daily net inflows of $57 million after experiencing three consecutive days of outflows.

Furthermore, BitMine, a company led by Tom Lee, has been increasing its Ethereum holdings, which may positively impact Ethereum's price trajectory. Lookonchain reported that BitMine purchased 40,000 ETH, valued at $83 million, just a day after announcing another acquisition of 40,613 ETH for approximately $82.85 million.

## External Factors Influencing Prices

Beyond accumulation and ETF inflows, external factors have also played a role in the recent price increases for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Notably, tensions between the United States and Iran have eased following discussions last Friday, which may have contributed to a more favorable market environment. Additionally, traders are starting to factor in the possibility of a rate cut in March, following recent job reports that indicated weaker economic performance.

## From author

The recent price movements of Bitcoin and Ethereum highlight the importance of both investor sentiment and external geopolitical factors in the cryptocurrency market. The substantial accumulation by whales and institutional investors suggests a growing confidence in the long-term value of these assets. The significant inflows into ETFs further reinforce this bullish sentiment, indicating that institutional interest remains strong despite previous downturns.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Bitcoin and Ethereum's price rebounds signal potential recovery from recent lows.
- Whale accumulation indicates strong confidence in the long-term value of cryptocurrencies.
- Renewed ETF inflows suggest institutional interest is on the rise, potentially stabilizing prices.
- Easing geopolitical tensions may contribute to a more favorable investment climate.
- The possibility of a rate cut could influence investor behavior and market dynamics moving forward.
