## Overview

XRP has experienced a significant decline, trading below the $1.30 mark after failing to maintain higher levels. The price is currently consolidating losses, facing resistance at key levels, which could dictate its future movements.

## Price Movement and Technical Analysis

XRP price has seen a substantial drop, extending losses and trading below the $1.30 threshold. Following this decline, the price has entered a phase of consolidation but continues to encounter hurdles near $1.30 and $1.350. Specifically, XRP has dropped below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, indicating a bearish trend.

A key trend line is forming, showing resistance at $1.380 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. If XRP remains below the $1.40 mark, it may continue its downward trajectory. The price has dipped over 15% from previous highs, failing to sustain levels above $1.50, mirroring the downward trends seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The price decline saw XRP fall below both the $1.450 and $1.40 levels, entering a short-term bearish zone. XRP even reached a low of $1.1356, after which it began to consolidate losses. A minor upward movement was observed above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, calculated from the downward move starting at the $1.6320 swing high down to the recent low of $1.1350.

Currently, XRP is trading below $1.30, with the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average also positioned above the current price. The near-term resistance is identified at the $1.320 level. A sustained close above this level could potentially push the price towards $1.380, where the bearish trend line and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level intersect.

If XRP fails to break through the $1.320 resistance, it may initiate another decline. Initial support is identified near the $1.240 level, with major support levels found at $1.2250 and $1.20. A significant downside break below the $1.2250 mark could lead the price to continue its decline toward $1.20 and potentially lower to the $1.1650 zone.

### Technical Indicators

- **Hourly RSI**: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for XRP/USD is below the 50 level, indicating a bearish sentiment.

## From author

The current market conditions for XRP illustrate the challenges facing the asset as it attempts to recover from significant losses. The resistance levels above $1.30 are critical for any potential recovery, while the support levels below will be closely monitored for signs of further declines. The interaction between these levels will be crucial in determining the short-term outlook for XRP.

## Impact on the crypto market

- XRP's decline reflects broader bearish trends seen in the cryptocurrency market, particularly with major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
- A failure to break resistance levels could lead to increased bearish sentiment among traders and investors.
- The significant support levels may provide a cushion against further declines, but any break below these levels could trigger a wave of selling.
