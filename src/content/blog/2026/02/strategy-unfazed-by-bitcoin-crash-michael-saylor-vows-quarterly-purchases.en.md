## Overview

Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), reaffirmed the company’s commitment to its Bitcoin strategy amid a challenging market environment. Despite concerns regarding financial risks and a downturn in Bitcoin prices, Saylor announced that Strategy will continue its regular quarterly purchases of Bitcoin.

## Strategy's Commitment to Bitcoin

In a recent interview with CNBC, Saylor emphasized that Strategy plans to maintain its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, irrespective of price volatility or skepticism from market analysts. He expressed confidence in the company’s ability to purchase Bitcoin quarterly, stating a commitment to this approach indefinitely. Saylor’s assertion reflects a long-term belief in Bitcoin's value, as he mentioned, “I expect we’ll be buying bitcoin every quarter forever.”

### Addressing Financial Concerns

Saylor addressed concerns about the company's significant debt load, which exceeds $8 billion, much of it linked to convertible notes issued to finance Bitcoin purchases. He downplayed the potential financial risks associated with a prolonged decline in Bitcoin prices, suggesting that the company would manage its financial obligations through refinancing if necessary. He stated that even in extreme scenarios, such as a significant drop in Bitcoin value, the company would “just roll it forward” to manage its debt.

Saylor expressed confidence that lenders would continue to support Strategy, regardless of Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. He asserted that the inherent volatility of Bitcoin does not detract from its long-term value. When questioned about the possibility of banks withdrawing support, he remained optimistic, indicating that the volatility of Bitcoin is a characteristic that ensures its enduring value.

### Liquidation Not an Option

Saylor firmly rejected the idea that Strategy might need to liquidate its Bitcoin holdings to stabilize its balance sheet. He reiterated that selling off assets is not part of the company’s plan and reinforced his belief in Bitcoin as a long-term asset. This stance is particularly significant given the current market sentiment, which has seen an increase in short interest surrounding the company’s stock.

## Market Sentiment and Stock Performance

Despite Saylor's optimistic outlook, market sentiment regarding Strategy has become more cautious. Short interest in the company’s stock has surged, rising approximately 40% from a low point observed in September 2025, according to analysis from Barron’s. Currently, around 30.5 million shares are sold short, representing about 10% of the company's public float. Concurrently, long-term investors have reduced their stakes, with shares of Strategy, identified by the ticker MSTR, experiencing a decline of approximately 70%.

As of now, Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with a reported holding of 714,644 BTC, valued at roughly $49 billion. Saylor reassured stakeholders about the company's liquidity, indicating that Strategy has sufficient cash reserves to cover its obligations, including dividend payments, for about two and a half years.
