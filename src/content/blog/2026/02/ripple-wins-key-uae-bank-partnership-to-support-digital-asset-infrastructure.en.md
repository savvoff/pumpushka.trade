## Overview

Ripple has announced a significant partnership with Zand, a digital bank in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), aimed at advancing the region's digital asset infrastructure. This collaboration is part of the UAE's broader strategy to establish itself as a leading hub for blockchain innovation and digital finance.

## Expanded Partnership Details

On Tuesday, Ripple disclosed that it is enhancing its existing relationship with Zand, which is known for its integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. The partnership is designed to bolster the UAE's digital economy by focusing on stablecoins and distributed ledger solutions. Ripple and Zand will collaborate on various initiatives, particularly around Zand’s UAE dirham-backed stablecoin, AEDZ, and Ripple’s US dollar stablecoin, RLUSD.

The primary objective of this partnership is to develop new infrastructure and use cases that bridge traditional financial services with blockchain-based systems, all within a regulated environment. This is crucial as the financial landscape increasingly shifts towards digital assets and solutions.

Reece Merrick, Ripple’s managing director for the Middle East and Africa, emphasized that this new agreement builds upon a prior payments partnership between the two entities. The expanded collaboration will explore several areas, including support for RLUSD within Zand’s regulated digital asset custody platform and establishing direct liquidity solutions between RLUSD and AEDZ.

## XRPL Deployment in the UAE

The partnership will also investigate the potential for seamless liquidity between the two stablecoins and the issuance of AEDZ on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Any deployment on the XRPL will adhere to relevant compliance standards, monitoring tools, and risk management controls, as stated by both companies. This focus on compliance is essential for ensuring that the digital asset initiatives align with regulatory expectations.

Michael Chan, CEO of Zand, expressed that the bank considers stablecoins, blockchain technology, and tokenization as pivotal components as traditional finance increasingly transitions to on-chain solutions. He characterized the partnership with Ripple as a significant milestone for the development of the digital asset ecosystem in the UAE. Chan also noted that this collaboration could fundamentally change how governments and businesses engage with secure and trusted blockchain-based solutions.
