## Overview

Lombard is taking a significant step in the realm of institutional finance by introducing a product designed to connect institutional custody with on-chain finance. This innovative approach allows institutions to utilize custodial Bitcoin as on-chain collateral without the need to physically transfer assets or relinquish control. Morpho has been designated as the initial liquidity partner for this initiative.

## What Happened

Lombard's new product aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi). By enabling institutions to leverage their custodial Bitcoin for on-chain activities, Lombard is facilitating a more integrated financial ecosystem. This development is particularly noteworthy as it addresses a common concern among institutional investors regarding the custody and control of their digital assets.

The collaboration with Morpho as the initial liquidity partner is a strategic move. It positions Lombard to enhance liquidity options for its clients while ensuring that the assets remain securely held in custody. This partnership is expected to streamline the process of using custodial assets in on-chain transactions, making it easier for institutions to participate in the burgeoning DeFi space.

The significance of this product lies in its potential to reshape how institutional investors view and interact with digital assets. By allowing the use of custodial Bitcoin as collateral without the need to transfer ownership, Lombard is reducing barriers to entry for institutions that may have previously hesitated to engage with on-chain finance. This could lead to increased adoption of digital assets within institutional portfolios.

This development not only enhances the functionality of custodial assets but also signals a growing recognition of the role that digital assets can play in institutional investment strategies. By addressing concerns related to control and custody, Lombard is paving the way for a more seamless integration of digital assets into mainstream finance.
