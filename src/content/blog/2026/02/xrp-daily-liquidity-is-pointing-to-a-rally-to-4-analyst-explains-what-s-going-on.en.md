## Overview

Recent analysis of XRP's liquidity structure suggests a potential upward movement towards the $4 mark. This assessment is based on liquidity heatmaps that reveal significant contrasts between short-term and higher-timeframe liquidity positioning. Currently, XRP is priced around $1.45, with large liquidity clusters positioned above this level.

## XRP's Current Liquidity Situation

Crypto analyst Bird has pointed out that XRP's liquidity on higher timeframes indicates a possible path leading to the $4 level. This insight comes in light of hourly and daily liquidity heatmaps shared by Cryptoinsightuk, which illustrate a stark difference in liquidity structures. At present, XRP is trading below substantial liquidity clusters that are visible above its current price level.

### Hourly Liquidity Analysis

The hourly liquidity heatmap reveals that much of the liquidity positioned just below the current price has already been cleared. Clusters in the $1.30 to $1.50 range have been exhausted, indicating that short-term stop hunts and liquidation pools have largely been addressed. Bird notes that with the depletion of this immediate liquidity, there is less reason for XRP to maintain its current price levels in the short term. As short-term liquidity diminishes, the price is expected to gravitate towards areas with larger, untouched liquidity pools. According to Bird, these larger concentrations of resting orders extend above the $4 level.

### Daily Liquidity Insights

On the daily heatmap, liquidity appears to be layered and dense above the current trading price, extending through various resistance bands and reaching beyond the $4 mark. The upper regions of the heatmap show heavy trading activity, with significant liquidity clusters between $2.50 and $4.00. This setup reflects a thick concentration of stop orders and resting interest. Bird emphasizes that this higher-timeframe liquidity acts like a magnet for price action, drawing it toward areas with substantial position orders that have yet to be engaged.

## Market Context

In addition to the liquidity analysis, Bird referenced a noticeable decline in Bitcoin dominance, which stands at 57.9%, down from 58.2% a week prior. This reduction in Bitcoin's dominance typically signals a capital rotation into altcoins. If this trend continues, XRP could benefit significantly, especially given its higher-timeframe liquidity targets.

Moreover, the current sentiment surrounding XRP remains relatively positive when compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bird suggests that this combination of declining dominance and neutral-to-cautious sentiment may pave the way for XRP's anticipated rally above the $4 mark.

## From author

The analysis of XRP's liquidity structure highlights the intricate relationship between market dynamics and price movements. By observing the clearing of short-term liquidity and the presence of higher-timeframe liquidity clusters, traders and investors can gain insights into potential future price actions. Understanding these liquidity patterns can be crucial for making informed trading decisions.

## Impact on the crypto market

- XRP's current liquidity positioning suggests potential upward momentum towards the $4 level.
- The clearing of short-term liquidity indicates less resistance in the immediate price range.
- The presence of heavy liquidity clusters above $2.50 may attract buying interest as price approaches these levels.
- A decline in Bitcoin dominance could lead to increased capital flow into altcoins, benefiting XRP.
- Positive sentiment around XRP compared to other cryptocurrencies may support its price movement.
- Market participants should monitor liquidity heatmaps closely to gauge potential price actions in the near term.
