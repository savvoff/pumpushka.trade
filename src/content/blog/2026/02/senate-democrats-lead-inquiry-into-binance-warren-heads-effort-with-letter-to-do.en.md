## Overview

Cryptocurrency exchange Binance is facing intensified scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers as they question the company's compliance with a settlement reached in 2023. This inquiry is spearheaded by Senate Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren, who are urging investigations into potential illicit financial activities linked to the platform.

## Senate Inquiry into Binance's Operations

On Friday, journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that eleven Democrats from the Senate Banking Committee, led by Elizabeth Warren, sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The letter calls for an examination of Binance's operations, focusing on recent allegations of illicit finance activities associated with the platform. The lawmakers highlighted reports suggesting that transactions linked to Iran might have occurred on Binance, raising concerns that such actions could violate the terms of the 2023 settlement made with U.S. authorities.

The 2023 settlement was significant, as it led to the resignation of Binance's founder and former CEO, Changpeng Zhao. The senators emphasized the need for a "thorough, impartial" investigation into whether Binance is fulfilling its legal obligations following this settlement. They also pointed out Binance's growing business relationships with President Donald Trump's crypto ventures and mentioned Trump's pardon of Zhao, indicating potential conflicts of interest.

This latest inquiry comes on the heels of another investigation initiated earlier in the week by Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal. Blumenthal's formal probe is conducted through the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which adds another layer of scrutiny to Binance's operations.

## Binance's Response to the Allegations

In response to the allegations raised by Senator Blumenthal, Binance co-CEO Richard Teng received a letter dated February 24. This letter referenced reports suggesting that the exchange might have facilitated significant violations of U.S. and international sanctions concerning Iran. Blumenthal pointed out that Binance appeared to have disregarded warnings aimed at mitigating Iranian money laundering operations.

Additionally, the senator referred to reports that indicated $1.7 billion in transactions linked to Iran might have traversed the Binance platform. In light of these serious allegations, Binance has firmly denied any wrongdoing. The company stated that it conducted an internal review and found "no evidence of violations of applicable sanctions laws." Furthermore, Binance rejected claims that it had dismissed investigators who raised concerns regarding compliance with sanctions.
