## Overview

Ethereum is currently navigating a significant phase as it develops a Libra formation on the weekly chart. This structure is still active, indicating a potential upward movement despite the need for confirmation. Key resistance levels loom overhead, and the current momentum may be stabilizing, suggesting that a major directional shift for ETH could be approaching.

## Current Situation

The Libra formation is a bullish pattern that Ethereum is forming, as highlighted by Kamile Uray on the X platform. As the weekly candle has not yet closed, the bullish formation remains valid, allowing for the possibility of an upward trajectory. A critical aspect of this formation is that it will only be considered invalid if Ethereum breaks below a specific low. The ongoing development of this pattern underscores the long-term nature of the current market dynamics surrounding Ethereum.

For Ethereum to confirm a potential reversal, it would need to achieve a daily close above a specific price level. Should this occur, it could pave the way for a significant move towards a historical high, although notable resistance is expected along the path. Specifically, the price may encounter challenges near certain key levels, which could impact the overall momentum.

Furthermore, Ethereum has recently experienced a notable rally, moving from a lower price level to a higher one. This surge without a significant correction raises the likelihood of short-term profit-taking by investors. In the wake of such a sharp increase, light selling pressure is anticipated as the market consolidates. It is suggested that a healthy pullback could occur in a specific price range, allowing Ethereum to reset and prepare for the next upward movement.

Analysts emphasize that any potential selling from the recent high is expected to remain controlled, rather than aggressive, which could maintain the bullish outlook. A dip into a defined pullback zone could be beneficial, setting the stage for further price appreciation. However, a direct push towards the next objective without a preceding correction could necessitate an adjustment in trading strategies.

## From author

The ongoing Libra formation on Ethereum's weekly chart represents a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency. As the market evolves, the interplay of resistance levels and the potential for upward momentum will be key factors to watch. The importance of a healthy correction after a sharp rally cannot be overstated, as it could significantly influence the future trajectory of ETH.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The Libra formation indicates a potential bullish trend for Ethereum, which could influence overall market sentiment.
- Resistance levels may create volatility as traders react to price movements and potential profit-taking.
- The ability to maintain price levels above key support could bolster confidence among investors.
- A healthy correction could establish a stronger foundation for future price increases, impacting trading strategies across the market.
