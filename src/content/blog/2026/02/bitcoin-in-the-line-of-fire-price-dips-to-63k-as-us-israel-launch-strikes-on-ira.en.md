## Overview

Following the launch of coordinated military strikes by the US and Israel on Iran, the cryptocurrency market experienced significant turmoil. Bitcoin's price fell sharply, reflecting the panic that swept through digital assets as traditional financial markets remained closed for the weekend. 

## What Happened

On a recent Friday, US President Donald Trump announced the initiation of "major combat operations" against Iran, targeting the country's missile systems, naval assets, and nuclear infrastructure. This military action was described as a preemptive move by Israel’s Defense Minister, and both nations coordinated the assault, which surprised many observers due to its scale and speed.

In retaliation, Iran responded with missile and drone attacks aimed not only at Israel but also at American military installations in the Gulf region. Reports indicated that a US base in Bahrain was struck, while defense systems in Qatar and the UAE intercepted projectiles. Explosions were reported in Dubai, and Bahrain shut its airspace entirely. Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency declared that all US bases and interests in the region would be considered legitimate targets.

As the situation escalated, Bitcoin's price fell as much as 3.8% to approximately $63,038, while Ethereum saw a nearly 9% decline. The rapid selling led to the liquidation of over 152,000 traders across the crypto markets. In total, around $128 billion in market value was wiped from digital assets in the hours following the confirmation of the strikes. 

Notably, the cryptocurrency market was the only major financial sector open during this period, as traditional stock and bond markets were closed for the weekend. This allowed digital assets to absorb the full impact of the panic. Bitcoin's decline from around $66,000 to its low of $63,038 was accompanied by Ethereum dropping below $1,850. Other cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, and Chainlink, recorded losses ranging from 8% to 12%. 

Data revealed that Bitcoin futures liquidations reached approximately $192 million, with futures trading volume surging to around $68.27 billion. This indicated that the derivatives markets were significantly amplifying the price movement rather than spot sellers alone driving the decline. Moreover, total liquidations across all crypto assets reached $515 million within 24 hours. The Fear and Greed Index, which measures market sentiment, fell to 14, indicating a shift into extreme fear territory.
