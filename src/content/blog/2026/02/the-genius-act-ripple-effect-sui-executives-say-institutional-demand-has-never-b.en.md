## Overview

In a recent discussion, Sui executives Evan Cheng and Stephen Mackintosh emphasized a notable shift in institutional demand for cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. They highlighted 2025 as a pivotal year for institutional adoption, indicating that tokenization and agentic commerce are set to become key areas of focus.

## Institutional Demand on the Rise

Evan Cheng and Stephen Mackintosh shared insights regarding the increasing interest from institutional investors in cryptocurrency. They pointed out that 2025 is anticipated to be a significant year, marking a turning point for institutional adoption within the crypto space. This assertion is rooted in the observation that more institutions are recognizing the potential of blockchain technology and its applications.

The executives specifically highlighted two emerging trends: tokenization and agentic commerce. Tokenization refers to the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. This practice has the potential to revolutionize how assets are traded and managed, making transactions more efficient and transparent. Meanwhile, agentic commerce involves leveraging decentralized technologies to create more autonomous and efficient commercial interactions. This evolution could lead to enhanced business operations and new revenue streams for institutions.

The executives' remarks underscore a growing recognition among institutional players that blockchain technology can offer significant advantages in terms of efficiency, security, and transparency. As these institutions continue to explore and implement blockchain solutions, the landscape of the financial industry may undergo substantial changes.
