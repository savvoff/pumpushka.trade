## Overview

Solana is currently facing significant downward pressure as it trades at multi-year lows. Analysts have expressed concerns about the altcoin's trajectory, with some lowering their end-of-year targets and others warning of a potential correction of up to 50%. A confirmed bearish pattern has emerged, further complicating the outlook for Solana.

## Solana's Recent Performance

On Wednesday, Solana retraced nearly 10% in daily trading, hitting a two-year low of $90. The cryptocurrency had previously fluctuated between $120 and $250 since February 2024, demonstrating resilience by retesting and bouncing off its macro support multiple times. However, over the weekend, Solana lost this crucial support area, closing January at approximately $105.

As the month began, Solana attempted to hold the psychological barrier of $100 and reclaim the $105 resistance as a support level. Unfortunately, the broader market movement, which also saw Bitcoin reaching multi-year lows, pushed Solana below its bull market lows from the previous year. Market observer Alex Clay noted that Solana's chart now reflects a confirmed bearish formation, indicating that the altcoin has lost an important support zone.

The cryptocurrency's chart reveals a macro Head and Shoulders (H&S) pattern on the weekly timeframe, which has been developing since early 2024. The left shoulder was formed during the Q1-Q2 2024 run, while the head developed during the late 2024 to early 2025 rally, which led to Solana's all-time high. The neckline of this bearish formation is situated around the $105 mark, and the right shoulder began to develop after a Q3 2025 rally. This pattern was confirmed during the recent market crash, and if Solana closes the week under $105, the neckline could become a resistance level.

Clay warned that the bearish pattern's first target is around the $42 mark, indicating a potential 55% correction from current levels.

## Analysts’ Concerns

Other market analysts have echoed concerns about Solana's future performance. Sjuul from AltCryptoGems remarked that the Solana chart evokes a "truly panic-inducing feeling," indicating a vast "no man's land" below current levels. Similarly, Crypto Tony noted that after breaking the $100 low "with conviction," the next significant support for Solana may be around $50. He views a correction toward this area as "obvious," especially since Bitcoin has yet to find a bottom.

Altcoin Sherpa pointed out that Solana has also lost its 200-Week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which he considers a critical support area before reaching $75 or lower. He emphasized that Solana tends to experience strong price reactions due to its association with the gaming sector, but this also means that corrections can be more severe.

Additionally, a major financial institution has revised its end-of-year target for Solana. Standard Chartered has reduced its near-term forecast from $310 to $250, citing the time required for the network’s next major use case to scale. However, the bank has raised its long-term projections, predicting Solana could reach $2,000 by 2030 as it evolves beyond its current use cases.
