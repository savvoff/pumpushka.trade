## Overview

The current discourse surrounding XRP suggests that its valuation may be misinterpreted by many investors. A commentator named BarriC asserts that XRP was fundamentally designed for institutional use rather than retail trading. This perspective challenges conventional views on the asset's price trajectory, hinting at a future where XRP's value is determined by its necessity in financial systems.

## XRP's Intended Purpose

According to BarriC, XRP was not created for retail trading. Instead, it serves as a crucial component of the financial infrastructure aimed at moving institutional value efficiently. He emphasizes that the XRP Ledger was specifically designed to enable rapid settlement, facilitate cross-border liquidity, and support asset tokenization. By allowing users to manage their own transactions without intermediary fees, the XRP Ledger sets itself apart from other blockchain technologies.

BarriC's viewpoint highlights that XRP's role as a bridge asset within the XRP Ledger ecosystem positions it uniquely. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has developed services that utilize XRP for on-demand liquidity between various currencies and financial institutions. This functionality suggests that XRP's demand will be driven by actual usage rather than speculative trading behavior typical of many cryptocurrencies.

## The Concept of Necessity Pricing

One of the key aspects of BarriC's analysis is the concept of necessity pricing, which could drastically influence XRP's market value. He posits that once XRP becomes an essential tool for banks and payment providers to settle transactions efficiently, its price will not increase gradually. Instead, it is expected to undergo a sudden repricing that aligns with the demands of the financial system.

BarriC dismisses traditional price anchors, such as $2 or even $100, suggesting that these figures do not reflect the potential future utility of XRP. He speculates that if necessity pricing were to occur, XRP's valuation could leap to much higher levels, possibly in the range of $1,000 to $50,000 per token. However, he also acknowledges that such projections seem unrealistic under current market conditions, especially considering the implications of market capitalization at those price points.

At the moment, XRP is trading at a level that reflects typical market conditions, with limited institutional usage compared to global payment volumes. Despite this, Ripple's recent initiatives have begun to establish XRP's presence in the global payments sector, indicating a potential shift in its role.

## From author

The discussion around XRP's valuation raises important questions about how cryptocurrencies are perceived and valued in the market. The idea that XRP was designed for institutional infrastructure rather than retail trading could reshape investor sentiment and market dynamics. If XRP does indeed become integral to global financial systems, the implications for its price and overall market perception could be profound.

## Impact on the crypto market

- XRP's valuation could shift dramatically if it becomes essential in institutional transactions.
- The concept of necessity pricing may redefine how investors approach cryptocurrency valuation.
- A potential sudden increase in XRP's price could disrupt traditional trading patterns in the crypto market.
- Increased adoption of XRP in global payments may lead to heightened interest and investment in the asset.
- The market may witness a reevaluation of other cryptocurrencies based on their utility and infrastructure roles.
