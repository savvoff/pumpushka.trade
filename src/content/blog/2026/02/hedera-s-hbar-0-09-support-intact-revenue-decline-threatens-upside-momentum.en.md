## Overview

Hedera (HBAR) has been trading around the $0.09 mark, testing a crucial technical support level. While the price has experienced occasional short-term bounces, overall price momentum remains weak due to declining network revenue and ecosystem metrics, which are affecting investor sentiment.

## Price Action and Technical Analysis

Hedera's token has been fluctuating near the $0.09 level, specifically around $0.094. The market capitalization for HBAR stands at $3.9 billion, with a trading volume indicating modest activity at these price levels. Despite the stability at this support level, HBAR's price trends downward on the daily chart. 

Recent price action has been corrective, with HBAR trading within a range close to its October lows. The $0.088–$0.09 zone has been identified as a support area, yet the overall trend remains bearish while HBAR continues to trade below significant resistance levels, which are between $0.126 and $0.177. Some analysts have noted the possible formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on shorter timeframes. This pattern suggests that a breakout above the $0.094–$0.096 range could lead to upward movement toward the $0.12 area. However, this potential requires confirmation amid limited buying momentum.

Technical indicators indicate that the relative strength index (RSI) is nearing oversold territory, while momentum oscillators, such as the MACD, are still leaning toward the downside. Traders have remarked that until HBAR can regain and maintain a position above its 20-day, 50-day, and longer-term moving averages, the structural bias is likely to remain negative.

## Ecosystem Metrics and Revenue Trends

Beyond the price charts, data from the on-chain ecosystem reveals a cooling of activity. The total value locked (TVL) in Hedera's decentralized finance layer has decreased significantly from its mid-2025 highs. Additionally, revenue from weekly decentralized applications has seen a sharp decline in recent weeks. 

Institutional interest in HBAR-related products, such as spot exchange-traded funds, has also shown limited inflows compared to stronger demand seen in other altcoin ETFs. This lack of fresh capital from larger market participants could further hinder price advances, especially if broader market uncertainty continues.

## From Author

The current situation surrounding Hedera (HBAR) illustrates the challenges posed by declining revenue and ecosystem activity. While technical support is evident near the $0.09 mark, the bearish trend remains a significant concern. The potential patterns observed may provide some hope for traders, but the lack of buying momentum complicates the outlook. The interplay of market sentiment and technical indicators will be crucial in determining HBAR's next moves.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- HBAR's struggle to maintain its support level may signal broader market sentiment issues.
- Declining revenue and activity in decentralized applications could reflect a trend affecting other projects in the crypto space.
- The potential for a breakout above immediate resistance could lead to increased interest from traders if confirmed.
- Limited institutional interest in HBAR-linked products may impact overall market confidence in similar altcoin investments.
- The ongoing bearish trend could set a precedent for price movements in other cryptocurrencies facing similar challenges.
