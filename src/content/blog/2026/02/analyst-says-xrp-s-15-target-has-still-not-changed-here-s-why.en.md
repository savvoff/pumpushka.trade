## Overview

Despite a recent decline in XRP's price below $1.3, crypto analyst Javon Marks maintains a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. He emphasizes that the long-term technical analysis suggests a potential surge into double-digit figures, with a target price of around $15 remaining intact.

## Analyst's Perspective

Javon Marks has expressed unwavering confidence in XRP's future performance, even in light of its recent price weakness. According to Marks, the current downturn is merely a temporary setback within a broader bullish trend. He argues that the measured move target of $15 for XRP still stands, highlighting a long-term bullish roadmap.

Marks has shared a comprehensive chart detailing XRP's price history over more than a decade, spanning from approximately 2014 to projections extending into 2026. His analysis reveals a recurring pattern observed across multiple market cycles, where XRP formed descending triangles or wedge formations before experiencing downturns below key support levels. Marks refers to these instances as "false breakdowns." Historically, following these false breakdowns, XRP has often entered into powerful parabolic rallies, achieving new all-time highs.

He notes that a similar breakout occurred in late 2024, where XRP’s price rose from around $0.55 to over $2.2. Marks draws parallels between this recent movement and the price action in 2017, which preceded a significant bull rally that saw XRP reach $3.84 in 2018. Based on this analysis, Marks suggests that this current cycle could result in a tenfold increase in XRP's price, which he estimates could exceed 900%.

The chart Marks presented also indicates a peak target between $15 and $18, with a potential surge amounting to approximately 2,872.31%.

## Additional Analyst Insights

In addition to Marks’ analysis, other analysts share a positive outlook on XRP despite recent market volatility. Market expert Steph is Crypto has identified a multi-year Cup and Handle pattern on XRP's chart, which could signal a historic price increase. This pattern suggests an upward trendline that could trigger a rally toward the $4 level, identified as a critical resistance area. A decisive breakout above this level could propel XRP's price to targets exceeding $30.

Moreover, reports from market expert Xaif Crypto indicate that a whale has recently taken a substantial long position on XRP, amounting to $3.34 million. This whale's position reflects a high level of confidence in XRP's bullish potential, holding $193,000 equity with a 104% margin. However, Xaif Crypto warns that if XRP's price drops to $1.37, the whale risks losing their entire investment, which is significant given that XRP's price has recently fallen below $1.3 and is currently around $1.28.
