## Overview

BNB Chain has demonstrated robust performance metrics amidst a recent market downturn and price corrections for BNB. The latest weekly ecosystem snapshot indicates sustained growth and key user engagement metrics, despite the challenges faced in the broader market.

## BNB Chain's Key Metrics

On January 29, 2026, BNB Chain released its weekly ecosystem snapshot covering the period from January 22 to January 28. The report highlighted a notable increase in average Daily Active Users (DAU), which reached over 4.9 million, marking an 11.4% increase from the previous week’s 4.4 million DAU. The BNB Smart Chain (BSC) accounted for 2.59 million DAU, while the newer opBNB recorded a significant 2.36 million DAU. Despite an 8.5% Week-on-Week decline for BSC, opBNB experienced a notable 46% increase in DAU.

In terms of transaction volume, BNB Chain registered over 142.6 million transactions during the week. This figure represents a slight 2% decline from the prior week but is consistent with January's trend of maintaining transaction volumes above 140 million. The breakdown of transactions showed that BSC contributed 118.96 million, while opBNB accounted for 23.65 million transactions.

The total trading volume for BNB Chain reached $56.4 billion within the same timeframe, and the Total Value Locked (TVL) was recorded at $6.83 billion, indicating a strong performance throughout 2025. Notably, the number of unique addresses on the network surpassed 700 million last year, with both BSC and opBNB achieving new milestones of over 4 million DAU. The TVL grew by over 40%, and daily transactions peaked at an all-time high of 31 million in October.

## New Ecosystem Developments

The report also underscored significant developments within the BNB ecosystem. A notable milestone was achieved in the Prediction Markets sector, which surpassed $20 billion in cumulative volume last week. Data from Dune Analytics indicated that the prediction markets have surged nearly 89% in volume since Q4 2025.

Furthermore, BNB Chain has led in weekly trading volume by chain, outpacing off-chain prediction markets as well as competitors such as Polygon, Solana, and Base. Institutional interest in the ecosystem has been signaled by Grayscale's filing of an S-1 form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a BNB-based spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).

## BNB's Price Movement

Despite these positive ecosystem developments, BNB is currently trading at a seven-month low, facing significant price corrections. The cryptocurrency has experienced a 13.1% pullback over the past week, dropping below the $900 and $800 support levels. Since reaching an all-time high on October 13, BNB has seen a 44.5% decline, with its price now fluctuating between the $760 and $770 range.

Market observers have identified a critical support level around the $730 mark. This level has been significant in both daily and weekly timeframes since August. Analysts have noted that if BNB can maintain this support, it may set the stage for a potential rebound. Conversely, losing this support could result in a rapid decline towards lower liquidity levels.

## From author

The data presented in the latest BNB Chain report illustrates a strong community engagement and ongoing institutional interest, which could be pivotal for the ecosystem's future resilience. However, the current price action of BNB indicates a precarious situation, emphasizing the need for close monitoring of support levels.

## Impact on the crypto market

- BNB Chain's increase in DAU and transaction volumes reflects strong user engagement despite broader market challenges.
- The significant growth in prediction markets suggests increasing interest and activity within the BNB ecosystem.
- Institutional interest, highlighted by Grayscale's ETF filing, could attract further investments and enhance BNB's market position.
- The current price struggles of BNB may influence market sentiment and trading strategies among investors.
- Maintaining key support levels is critical for BNB to avoid further declines and potentially regain upward momentum.
