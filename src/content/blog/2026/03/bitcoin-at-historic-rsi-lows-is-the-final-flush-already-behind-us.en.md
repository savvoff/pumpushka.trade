## Overview

Bitcoin is currently trading at weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) levels that have historically been seen near the bottoms of bear markets. This development suggests that selling pressure may be subsiding, indicating a potential turning point in the market. However, analysts caution that confirmation is needed before declaring an end to the downward trend.

## Market Analysis

Bitcoin's weekly RSI has fallen into a territory that has previously marked bear market bottoms, according to crypto analyst Batman. This momentum zone often appears during late-stage capitulation phases, which are critical signals that the market might be approaching a significant turning point. While Batman acknowledges the importance of waiting for proper confirmation to affirm a reversal, he notes that historical patterns indicate that when the RSI compresses to these levels, Bitcoin is usually much closer to a structural low than the start of a new decline.

Reflecting on the bear cycle of 2022, Batman observes that when the RSI reached these extreme levels, Bitcoin did print one final lower low. However, this occurred very close to the ultimate bottom, suggesting that most of the downside had already been experienced when momentum reached such depressed readings. He emphasizes that probabilities are more significant than precision, implying that when Bitcoin trades at these weekly RSI levels, it often represents a zone where strategic accumulation becomes increasingly appealing.

In a separate analysis, SuperBro highlighted that Bitcoin has recorded six consecutive weekly lower highs, a rare structural pattern. The last time this happened was during the COVID crash in 2020, a period characterized by high volatility followed by a macro reversal. Currently, Bitcoin is trading below the 200-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the volume Point of Control (POC), although the weekly candle has not yet closed. A reclaim of the POC before the close could lead to a sharp upside reaction, indicating that the breakdown attempt might be losing strength.

Just below the current price levels, the rising 200-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) provides an additional layer of higher-timeframe support. The RSI remains at extreme levels, signifying that momentum is already stretched. The combination of oversold conditions and six consecutive lower highs pressing into significant support makes the case for continued downside less compelling.

Despite the near-term structure, the broader megaphone formation remains intact. If this macro pattern plays out, its upper trajectory suggests potential targets well above current levels, maintaining a long-term expansion thesis despite the current compression.

## From author

The current state of Bitcoin, marked by historically low RSI levels and the formation of six consecutive lower highs, presents a complex picture for investors. While the potential for a reversal exists, the lack of confirmation calls for caution. The historical context provided by analysts serves as a reminder that past performance is not a guarantee of future results. As the market navigates these waters, it remains essential for traders and investors to stay informed and vigilant.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The trading at historically low RSI levels may indicate the potential end of the current bear market.
- Analysts suggest that the current price action could be nearing a crucial turning point.
- The formation of six consecutive lower highs is a rare signal that may suggest increased volatility ahead.
- The presence of key support levels, such as the 200-week SMA, could influence future price movements.
- Oversold conditions combined with structural patterns may lead to a strategic accumulation phase for investors.
