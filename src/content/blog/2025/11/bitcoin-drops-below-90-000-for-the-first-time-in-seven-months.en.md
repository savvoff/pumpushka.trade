## Overview

Bitcoin has experienced a significant decline, falling below $90,000 for the first time in seven months. This drop marks a continuation of a month-long downturn that has erased the cryptocurrency's gains for the year 2025, causing a shift in sentiment across the digital asset landscape.

## What Happened

The recent decline in Bitcoin's value has been part of a larger trend over the past month. As Bitcoin slipped below the $90,000 mark, it highlighted the extent of the ongoing slide that has affected its market position. This situation has not only impacted Bitcoin but has also influenced the overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. 

## Why It Matters

The drop below this significant price point is indicative of broader market trends and investor sentiment. As Bitcoin's value diminishes, it raises concerns among investors about the stability and future prospects of cryptocurrencies. The erasure of gains for 2025 further emphasizes the volatility inherent in digital assets, leading to increased caution among market participants.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The decline in Bitcoin's value contributes to a negative sentiment among investors in the cryptocurrency space.
