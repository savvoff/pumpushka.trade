## Overview

Analysts remain optimistic about XRP's future despite its current distribution phase. They continue to set price targets ranging from $10 to $30 for potential cycle peaks, supported by various favorable factors.

## Current Market Situation

XRP is currently experiencing a distribution phase, which typically refers to a period where assets are sold off by holders. Despite this, analysts maintain a positive outlook on the cryptocurrency's trajectory.
