## Overview

Avalanche has reclaimed its position among the top 20 cryptocurrencies, surpassing Hedera. This resurgence coincides with Securitize receiving EU approval to launch a regulated blockchain-based securities market on the Avalanche network, marking a significant milestone for both entities.

## Securitize's EU Approval and Its Significance

Securitize has obtained regulatory authorization from Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) to operate a tokenized trading and settlement system under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime. This approval allows Securitize to passport its license across the European Single Market, which includes key markets such as France, Germany, and Italy. 

The entire infrastructure for this initiative will be built on the Avalanche blockchain, which offers sub-second finality, regulatory-grade network performance, and a scalable architecture. This development positions Avalanche as a central player in institutional tokenization.

Securitize is also preparing for a significant SPAC merger, which is valued at $1.25 billion, while managing an on-chain treasury fund exceeding $1 billion, backed by BlackRock. The first issuance compliant with EU regulations is expected to take place in early 2026, potentially paving the way for a substantial market of regulated tokenized assets, which is projected to reach an estimated $18 trillion by 2033.

## AVAX Price Dynamics

Despite the positive fundamental developments, the price of AVAX remains compressed near a long-term support zone between $12 and $15. Recently, the token experienced a bounce to $14.94, marking a daily gain of 6.5% and surpassing its 7-day moving average of $13.96. However, it now faces resistance at the 20-day simple moving average, which is positioned at $15.21.

Technical indicators show signs of improvement, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 42, indicating a balanced market condition, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows bullish divergence. The Stochastic momentum indicator also suggests a favorable environment for buyers.

## Institutional Accumulation and Market Sentiment

Institutional interest in AVAX appears to be strengthening. The AVAX One Treasury has accumulated over 9.37 million AVAX, investing $110 million between November 5 and 23. This brings total reserves to over 13.8 million AVAX, reflecting a strong long-term confidence from institutional players.

Supporting this bullish sentiment, on-chain metrics indicate rising deployed contracts, increased developer activity, and futures taker data showing a dominance of buyers. These factors suggest that AVAX may be forming a medium-term bottom.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Avalanche's resurgence in the top 20 cryptocurrencies highlights growing institutional interest.
- Securitize's EU approval marks a significant regulatory milestone for blockchain-based securities.
- The establishment of a regulated market on Avalanche could attract more institutional investments.
- Positive technical signals and institutional accumulation may indicate potential price recovery for AVAX.
- The projected growth of regulated tokenized assets presents new opportunities for the broader crypto market.
