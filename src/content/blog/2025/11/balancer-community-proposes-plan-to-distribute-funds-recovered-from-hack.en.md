## Proposal Details

The proposal outlines a strategic plan for how the recovered funds will be allocated to the victims of the hack. The focus is on ensuring that those affected by the incident receive compensation for their losses. The community is working collaboratively to finalize the distribution plan, which is a critical step in addressing the aftermath of the hack.

## Importance of the Proposal

Second, the distribution of funds can help restore trust in the platform and its governance, showing that the community takes accountability for its security. Lastly, it sets a precedent for how similar situations may be handled in the future within the crypto ecosystem.

## Impact on the crypto market
