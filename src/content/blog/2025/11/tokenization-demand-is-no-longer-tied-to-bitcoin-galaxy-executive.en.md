## Overview

The demand for tokenization has evolved, becoming less reliant on the price movements of Bitcoin. According to Galaxy's tokenization head, Thomas Cowan, institutions are increasingly recognizing the advantages of tokenization.

## Institutional Interest in Tokenization

Thomas Cowan, who leads the tokenization efforts at Galaxy, has observed a shift in the way institutions view tokenization. He states that the interest in tokenization is now independent of Bitcoin's price fluctuations. This indicates a growing understanding among institutions of the benefits that tokenization can offer, regardless of the performance of Bitcoin in the market.

This change in perspective is significant, as it suggests that the motivations for engaging with tokenization are becoming more diverse. Institutions are starting to appreciate the various applications and efficiencies that tokenization can provide, moving beyond the traditional correlation with Bitcoin's value.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased institutional engagement in tokenization could lead to broader adoption of blockchain technology.
- A decoupling of tokenization demand from Bitcoin's price may result in more stable growth in the tokenization sector.
- Institutions may explore new use cases for tokenization, enhancing innovation in the crypto space.
- The shift could attract a wider range of investors and projects interested in the benefits of tokenization.
- Overall, this trend may contribute to a more mature and diversified cryptocurrency market.
