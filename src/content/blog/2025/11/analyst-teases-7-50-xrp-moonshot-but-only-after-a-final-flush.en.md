## Overview

Crypto analyst Charting Guy has presented a detailed analysis of XRP, suggesting that the token is undergoing a Wyckoff reaccumulation phase. Despite a year of range-bound trading, he argues that XRP is not bearish and has the potential to reach approximately $7.50 after a final downward movement.

## Current XRP Analysis

Charting Guy's analysis is based on XRP/USD charts from Bitstamp, where XRP is currently trading around $2.23 after experiencing an 8-9% gain over the week. He notes that XRP is consolidating below its 2025 peak of approximately $3.317, which he identifies as the 1.0 Fibonacci level. The retracement levels are drawn from a cycle low, producing a series of key Fibonacci levels, including the 0.5 level at approximately $0.61495 and the 0.786 level at approximately $1.61246.

He highlights that XRP is building support on previous cycle highs, particularly within the 0.618 to 0.786 retracement area, referred to as the "golden pocket." Above the 2025 high, he outlines Fibonacci extensions, with the first being around $8.29661.

### XRP Price Roadmap for 2026

Charting Guy's roadmap for XRP is illustrated on a two-day XRP/USD chart that incorporates a Wyckoff schematic. The analysis starts with a Preliminarily Supply (PSY) phase and a Buying Climax (BC) phase, leading into a Secondary Test (ST) and an Automatic Reaction (AR) that establishes the lower boundary of the trading range.

Key price levels are marked, including a support floor near $1.61184, an intermediate band around $1.95, and resistance at approximately $2.90. Mid-2025 is projected to see XRP enter an "UT Phase B" upthrust into the low $3 zone before entering a downward channel. 

The analysis anticipates a downward spike to test the support at $1.61184, which is seen as a final shakeout before a rebound. Following this, XRP is expected to retake the $1.95 area and establish a higher low between $2.00 and $2.20. This point is identified as the Last Point of Support (LPS).

Subsequent to this, a break of the descending trendline is anticipated, leading to a significant price increase, with XRP projected to rally from around $3.00 to just above $7.50 before stalling.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Charting Guy's analysis indicates a potential bullish scenario for XRP, which may attract investors looking for opportunities in a recovering market.
- The identification of key Fibonacci levels suggests a structured approach to price movements, which could bolster trader confidence.
- The anticipated final flush below $1.70 may create a buying opportunity for those who believe in XRP’s long-term prospects.
- The emphasis on the Wyckoff reaccumulation model could signal to market participants that XRP is preparing for a significant upward movement.
- Overall, the analysis could influence market sentiment, leading to increased interest and potential volatility in XRP trading activity.
