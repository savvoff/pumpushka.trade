## Overview

Conor McGregor, a former UFC champion, made headlines by calling out Khabib Nurmagomedov over NFTs. This interaction, however, was met with a rebuttal from ZachXBT, a prominent figure in the crypto community.

## What Happened

Conor McGregor attempted to enter the cryptocurrency space by launching a celebrity memecoin called REAL in April. Despite his efforts and the potential popularity surrounding his brand, the project failed to gain traction among investors and the broader crypto community. This lack of success may have contributed to McGregor's decision to engage with Khabib regarding NFTs, a sector that has seen significant interest and investment.

ZachXBT, known for his insights and analysis in the crypto space, responded to McGregor's call-out. His reaction highlights the skepticism surrounding celebrity involvement in cryptocurrency projects, especially after a failed attempt like McGregor's memecoin.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The interaction between McGregor and Khabib reflects the ongoing interest in NFTs and celebrity influence within the crypto space.
- McGregor's unsuccessful launch of the REAL memecoin serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by celebrities entering the cryptocurrency market.
- ZachXBT's response underscores the critical scrutiny that celebrity-driven projects often encounter.
- The incident may influence how other celebrities approach involvement in cryptocurrencies and NFTs in the future.
