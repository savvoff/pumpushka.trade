## Overview

Conor McGregor recently made headlines by calling out Khabib Nurmagomedov in relation to NFTs. This public exchange drew the attention of ZachXBT, who responded to the situation.

## What Happened

Conor McGregor, a former UFC champion, attempted to enter the cryptocurrency market by launching his own celebrity memecoin named REAL in April. However, this project did not achieve the desired success and failed to gain traction among potential investors and enthusiasts. The lack of interest in McGregor's memecoin coincided with his recent remarks about Khabib, which were centered around the NFT space.

ZachXBT, known for his involvement in the crypto community, responded to McGregor's call-out, effectively shutting down the conversation. This interaction highlights the ongoing dynamics within the cryptocurrency and NFT sectors, especially as celebrities explore opportunities in these markets.

## Impact on the crypto market
