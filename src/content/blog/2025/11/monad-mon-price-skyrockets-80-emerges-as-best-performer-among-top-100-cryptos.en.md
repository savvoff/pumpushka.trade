## Overview

The Layer 1 blockchain Monad has officially launched, resulting in a significant surge in its native token, MON. Within 24 hours of its debut, MON emerged as the top-performing asset among the 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

## Launch and Initial Performance

Monad's token sale commenced on Coinbase's new token presale platform, raising approximately $50 million. However, after an initial surge in enthusiasm, fundraising efforts began to slow, accumulating $95 million of a targeted $187 million for Circle’s USDC stablecoin. Despite this, the launch of the Monad blockchain reignited investor interest, leading to an over 80% rise in the MON token’s value.

## Token Valuation and Market Position

According to CoinGecko data, the surge in MON's price elevated its diluted valuation to around $4 billion. The token has managed to maintain its value above $0.040, reaching a market capitalization close to $440 million. Notably, MON achieved an all-time high of $0.045 shortly after the launch, reflecting the increased demand for the token within the last day.

## Market Context

This rally in MON's price occurred despite a challenging environment for the broader cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has seen a retracement of over 30% from its all-time high, while Ethereum has struggled to maintain levels above $3,000. The mainnet launch of Monad was also accompanied by the listing of the MON token on several major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini.

## Transaction Activity

Excitement surrounding the MON token extends beyond its price performance. Data from DeFillama indicates that the Monad blockchain has processed over three million transactions from around 140,000 addresses, with developers deploying more than 18,000 smart contracts. Investors who participated in the token sale had the opportunity to sell their holdings immediately after launch, although Coinbase issued a warning against early selling that could affect future allocations.

## Trading Volume

In terms of trading volume, MON on the Solana blockchain exceeded $87 million within 24 hours, surpassing trading volumes on Monad itself. This performance exceeded that of Hyperliquid by 149% and positioned MON ahead of other platforms such as KuCoin, Gate, Kraken, and Bitget, making Solana the fifth-largest venue by total trading volume across exchanges.

## Impact on the crypto market

- MON became the best-performing asset among the top 100 cryptocurrencies within 24 hours of its launch.
- The token achieved a significant valuation and market capitalization shortly after its debut.
- The successful launch of the Monad blockchain demonstrates robust investor interest amidst a challenging market environment.
- Increased transaction activity indicates strong engagement from users and developers on the Monad platform.
- The warning issued by Coinbase highlights a focus on fostering long-term investors over short-term traders.
- The trading volume on Solana showcases the competitive landscape for MON and its acceptance across various exchanges.
