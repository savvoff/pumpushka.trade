## Overview

The Bitcoin price has been on a bearish trajectory since the second week of October, recently slipping below the significant $100,000 support level. This decline has raised concerns among market participants regarding the overall market structure, with on-chain evaluations indicating a growing downside bias for Bitcoin.

## Recent Developments

According to a report from the on-chain research firm Arab Chain, there has been a notable increase in sell-side momentum for Bitcoin on Binance, which is the largest exchange by trading volume. This observation is based on the BTC Taker Imbalance % metric, which assesses whether the market is primarily driven by aggressive buyers or sellers. A negative reading indicates a seller-dominated market, and recent data has shown a spike in selling pressure.

The Taker Imbalance % was reported at -0.17%, which typically signifies ongoing bearish action. This metric reflects a significant disparity between selling and buying volumes, with Arab Chain noting a recorded $1.517 billion in selling volume compared to $1.058 billion in buying volume. This data underscores the prevailing power of sellers in the current Bitcoin market.

As a result of this seller dominance, the Bitcoin price has been hovering around the $94,000 mark. Each attempt for the price to rise has met with increasing sell resistance, stifling any serious bullish momentum. The ongoing bearish pressure suggests that this is not merely a market correction but rather a persistent influx of sell pressure that could ultimately overwhelm the weaker buy-side liquidity at the current support level.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The increase in sell-side momentum indicates a potential shift in market sentiment among Bitcoin traders.
- The negative Taker Imbalance % suggests that sellers are currently in control, which may lead to further price declines.
- The significant disparity in selling versus buying volume highlights the challenges for bullish traders trying to regain control.
- The hovering price around $94,000 illustrates the resistance faced by Bitcoin, potentially leading to a deeper correction if the trend continues. 
- Market participants may need to monitor liquidity levels closely to gauge potential support levels in the near future.
