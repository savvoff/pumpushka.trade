## Overview

XRP has shown a steady increase in price, currently consolidating gains and preparing for potential further upward movement. The price is now positioned above significant support levels, indicating a bullish sentiment in the market.

## Recent Price Movements

XRP's price began a notable upward trend, surpassing key resistance levels of $2.050 and $2.080. The price gained momentum, breaking through the $2.150 resistance and even reaching above the $2.20 mark. A high was recorded at $2.286, although a brief correction followed.

Currently, XRP is trading above $2.180 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Additionally, a bullish trend line is forming with support at $2.170 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. This technical setup suggests that if XRP can overcome the $2.250 resistance, it may continue its upward trajectory.

## Resistance and Support Levels

As XRP aims for higher prices, it faces initial resistance near the $2.250 level. If this resistance is cleared, the next significant target is around $2.280, with potential further gains leading to $2.320 and beyond. Conversely, if XRP fails to break through the $2.250 resistance, it may see a decline.

The initial support levels on the downside are positioned at $2.170 and $2.120. A drop below $2.120 could lead to further declines toward $2.050 and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent upward move.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for XRP/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone, indicating positive market momentum.
- **Hourly RSI**: The Relative Strength Index for XRP/USD is above the 50 level, suggesting bullish strength.
