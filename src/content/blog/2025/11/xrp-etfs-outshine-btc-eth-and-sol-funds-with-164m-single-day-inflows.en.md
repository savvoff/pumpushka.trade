## Overview

Spot XRP Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have recently outperformed other crypto-based investment products, marking a significant moment in the cryptocurrency market. This surge in interest is particularly notable following the successful launches of Grayscale and Franklin Templeton's XRP-focused funds, which achieved record-breaking inflows.

## Recent Developments

The week began with the introduction of a second batch of spot XRP ETFs, which included the launches of Grayscale's GXRP and Franklin Templeton's XRPZ. Both funds debuted with impressive performance, each recording over $60 million in net inflows on their first day. Franklin Templeton's XRPZ ETF launched on NYSE Arca, emphasizing XRP's role in facilitating cross-currency settlements within the digital payments ecosystem. Meanwhile, Grayscale converted its existing XRP fund into the publicly traded GXRP ETF.

Both of these new ETFs surpassed the previous debut record set by Canary Capital's XRPC, which launched earlier this year. XRPC had a total volume of $58 million on its debut and was initially anticipated to outperform Bitwise's BSOL. In its first 30 minutes of trading, XRPC achieved $26 million in volume, indicating strong initial demand, while BSOL recorded $10 million in the same timeframe, eventually reaching $33 million by midday.

The successful launches of the Grayscale and Franklin Templeton funds resulted in their respective inflows of $67.4 million and $62.6 million on their launch days, making them the best ETF debuts of the year thus far. 

## Performance Comparison

The performance of the XRP ETF category outshone other leading ETFs, including those based on Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Solana (SOL). On November 24, the total net inflows for the XRP ETF category reached $164 million, driven by both the new Grayscale and Franklin Templeton funds, as well as Canary Capital's XRPC and Bitwise's XRP ETF, each contributing $16.4 million.

In comparison, ETH ETFs saw inflows of $96.6 million, with BlackRock's ETHA leading the charge, while Solana-based funds garnered $58 million. Over a 20-day period, Solana funds accumulated a total of $568 million in inflows. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs faced challenges, starting the week with $151 million in outflows, primarily due to BlackRock's IBIT.

Overall, spot XRP ETFs have recorded cumulative net inflows of $586.8 million, maintaining an eight-day positive streak and exceeding the total inflows of SOL ETFs. 

## Impact on the crypto market

- The successful launches of XRP ETFs reflect growing institutional interest in XRP as a digital asset.
- The record-breaking inflows into XRP ETFs may signal a shift in investor sentiment towards altcoins, particularly XRP.
- The performance of XRP ETFs could influence other cryptocurrency funds to adapt their strategies in response to this trend.
- Bitcoin ETFs, facing outflows, may need to reassess their market positioning and appeal to regain investor confidence.
- The strong debut of XRP ETFs may encourage more financial institutions to explore cryptocurrency investment products.
