## Overview

Bitcoin experienced a decline, reaching weekly lows at $101,300. This drop coincided with a rally in US equities and gold, occurring just before a crucial vote aimed at resolving the US government shutdown. 

## What Happened

Bitcoin's price fell as investors shifted their focus towards traditional assets such as stocks and gold. This shift in sentiment suggests that market participants may be seeking stability in more conventional investment avenues amidst uncertainties surrounding the government shutdown. The upcoming vote to end the shutdown is a significant event that has influenced investor behavior, leading to a notable movement in these financial markets.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Bitcoin's decline reflects a broader trend of investor preference for traditional assets during periods of uncertainty.
- The rally in US equities and gold highlights a potential shift in market sentiment away from cryptocurrencies.
- The situation underscores the interconnectedness of different asset classes and how geopolitical events can affect investor decisions across markets.
- The upcoming vote on the government shutdown may continue to impact market dynamics, influencing both traditional and crypto assets.
- This event serves as a reminder of the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market, particularly in response to external economic factors.
