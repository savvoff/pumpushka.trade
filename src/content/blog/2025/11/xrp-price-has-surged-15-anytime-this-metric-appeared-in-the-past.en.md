## Overview

XRP is currently exhibiting notable resilience, with analysts observing a key technical metric that has historically preceded short-term price rebounds. This metric's reappearance suggests a potential for an uptick in XRP's price, particularly in light of recent market dynamics.

## Analysis of Recent Trends

Analysts have pointed out that XRP's price has shown unusual strength amidst a broader market downturn, particularly as Bitcoin experienced significant declines. In a recent technical analysis, a crypto market expert noted that the current market setup resembles previous conditions that typically resulted in price surges for XRP. Specifically, the re-emergence of a bid-skew metric has been linked to sharp recoveries in the past.

At the time of the analysis, XRP was trading around $2.19. The analyst emphasized that this metric has historically led to price increases of at least 10% each time it has appeared. Despite Bitcoin's price falling dramatically, XRP maintained its local low from earlier in the month, illustrating a divergence from Bitcoin's performance.

Furthermore, the analyst highlighted that XRP's strength during periods of Bitcoin weakness has often signaled potential price reversals. Over the last three months, the recurring bid-skew pattern has coincided with upward movements in XRP's price.

However, it is worth noting that XRP's price has recently dipped below the $2 mark, reaching $1.9 at one point. This decline occurred even as the market dynamics shifted, indicating that not all price movements adhere to historical patterns.

## Selling Pressure Observations

In a follow-up update, the analyst shared additional insights into XRP's price movements, noting a drop from $2.19 to $2.01. This decline serves as a reminder that market dynamics can deviate from expected patterns. The recent price action aligns with instances where typical order book signals have failed to predict short-term movements.

Evidence suggests that the selling pressure on XRP appears to be "controlled," as opposed to forced liquidations. The Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) curves for XRP on major exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, and Bybit, have shown a downward trend. Notably, Binance has recorded the most significant decline among all crypto exchanges. The analyst warned that these developments complicate timing for potential reversals, as a gradual bottoming process may occur without strong liquidation events.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- XRP has demonstrated resilience amid broader market downturns, particularly in relation to Bitcoin's performance.
- The reappearance of the bid-skew metric has historically been linked to price surges for XRP.
- Recent selling pressure appears to be controlled, indicating a different market dynamic compared to previous trends.
- The downward trend in cumulative volume on major exchanges may complicate traditional reversal signals.
- Analysts caution that market dynamics can be unpredictable, making it challenging to forecast short-term price movements.
