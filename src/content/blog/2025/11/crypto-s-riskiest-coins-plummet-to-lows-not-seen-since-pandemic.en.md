## Overview

The ongoing selloff in the crypto market has significantly impacted smaller, riskier tokens, which are experiencing sharp declines. This trend highlights the vulnerability of these assets in the current market climate.

## What Happened

The crypto market is currently undergoing a selloff, with a notable focus on the smallest and riskiest tokens. These tokens are facing substantial price drops, reaching lows not seen since the pandemic. The broader implications of this selloff suggest a challenging environment for these assets, as they are the most affected by the downturn.

## Impact on the crypto market
