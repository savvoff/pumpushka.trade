Truther, a crypto payments firm, is preparing to launch a non-custodial Visa card that will support USDT transactions in El Salvador. This innovative card aims to simplify the process of using cryptocurrency for everyday purchases without the need for preloading funds.

## Key Features of the Truther Visa Card

The Truther Visa card offers several notable features:

- **Non-Custodial Nature**: Users will not need to preload funds onto the card, allowing for greater flexibility in managing their cryptocurrency.
- **Currency Conversion Fee**: The card will implement a 2% fee on currency conversions, which is a consideration for users when making transactions.
- **Tax Advantage for Brazilian Users**: Brazilian users will benefit from the absence of the IOF tax, making the card more appealing for individuals in that region.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The card's features could attract more users to cryptocurrency by minimizing barriers and fees associated with traditional banking.
- The absence of the IOF tax for Brazilian users may encourage increased adoption of crypto payments in Brazil.
- The introduction of this card could potentially influence other crypto firms to develop similar products, promoting competition in the crypto payment space.
