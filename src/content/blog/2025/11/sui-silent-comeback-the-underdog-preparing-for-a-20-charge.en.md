## Overview

SUI is showing signs of recovery following a significant drop during a recent market flash crash. Analysis from BeLaunch indicates that the token may be at a pivotal point, with potential scenarios suggesting a significant move could be on the horizon.

## Current Situation

Following the flash crash on October 10, SUI has begun to regain strength. BeLaunch posed the question of whether SUI could reach a higher price point in the next bull cycle. The analysis suggests that SUI is currently at a critical juncture, where its next moves could significantly influence the broader market's direction.

### Potential Scenarios for SUI

BeLaunch outlined two scenarios regarding SUI's potential trajectory:

1. **Primary Scenario**: This scenario has a higher probability and suggests that SUI is testing a critical breakout above a significant resistance level. The analysis indicates that Wave (2) may have completed its cycle, setting the stage for Wave (3), which is typically an impulsive move in the Elliott Wave structure. A confirmed breakout could lead to new highs for SUI.

2. **Alternative Scenario**: This scenario carries a lower probability and posits that the current price structure could remain corrective. In this case, SUI may form an alternative X wave before entering another corrective phase. Although this scenario is less likely, it is still worth monitoring.

## Technical and On-Chain Analysis

BeLaunch noted that on-chain fundamentals for SUI indicate early signs of recovery, despite the broader market's focus being elsewhere. The Total Value Locked (TVL) in SUI has remained stable around a certain level, with a significant move above a specified threshold seen as a crucial shift in momentum. Additionally, Daily Active Users (DAU) have been gradually increasing, suggesting a growing interest in the token.

Despite the positive on-chain metrics, SUI's price has not reflected this strength, which is often indicative of an accumulation phase. During such phases, investors may underestimate the asset's potential while long-term holders accumulate positions in anticipation of a breakout. Historically, SUI has demonstrated a tendency to rally within a few weeks after both TVL and DAU metrics begin to trend upward.

BeLaunch emphasized the robust nature of the current technical and on-chain setup. Stabilizing fundamentals, shifting momentum indicators, and specific signals suggest that SUI may be on the verge of emerging from its current consolidation phase into a new bullish trend.

## Impact on the crypto market

- SUI's recovery could influence investor sentiment and market dynamics in the broader crypto landscape.
- A confirmed breakout could signal increased interest and participation in SUI, potentially attracting more investors.
- The accumulation phase may lead to a stronger price movement if historical patterns hold true.
- Positive on-chain metrics could encourage other projects to focus on similar growth strategies, impacting overall market health.
- The attention on SUI may draw focus away from other tokens, affecting their performance in the market.
