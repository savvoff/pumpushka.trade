## What Happened

The launch of the two new XRP ETFs marks a noteworthy event in the cryptocurrency landscape. With the absorption of 80 million tokens, these ETFs indicate a growing interest in XRP among investors. The price action of XRP has shown a bullish flag pattern, suggesting potential upward momentum following a period of resistance at $2.20.
