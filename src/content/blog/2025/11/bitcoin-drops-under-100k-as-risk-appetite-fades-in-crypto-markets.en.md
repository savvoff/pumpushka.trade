## Overview

Bitcoin has experienced a significant decline, dropping below the $100,000 mark as risk appetite wanes in the crypto markets. The cryptocurrency is currently trading below critical support levels, indicating a bearish trend that could lead to further losses.

## Bitcoin Price Movement

Bitcoin's price failed to recover and remained below the $104,000 threshold. The cryptocurrency has dropped over 4%, recently forming a low at $98,000. This decline began as Bitcoin fell below the $102,000 and $100,000 levels, indicating a shift in market sentiment. 

The current trading situation shows Bitcoin below the 100 hourly Simple Moving Average, and a bearish trend line is forming with resistance at $102,200. If the price settles below the $98,500 zone, further downward movement is expected. 

### Recent Decline Details

- Bitcoin could not maintain a positive position above the $103,500 pivot level. 
- The presence of active BTC bears pushed the price below the $102,500 mark, leading to a further drop past the $100,000 level.
- Following the formation of a low at $98,000, Bitcoin is now consolidating losses near the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of its recent decline.

### Resistance and Support Levels

Should Bitcoin attempt a recovery, it may face resistance near the $100,500 level. The first key resistance is at $101,000, followed by the $102,200 resistance level. A close above $102,200 could potentially lead to a rise towards $103,500 and possibly higher levels.

Conversely, if Bitcoin fails to surpass the $102,200 resistance, it may initiate another decline. Immediate support is located near $98,500, with significant support at $98,000 and $96,500. If losses continue, Bitcoin could approach the $95,000 support level, with the main support situated at $92,500, where further declines could accelerate.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- Bitcoin's drop below $100,000 reflects a decrease in investor confidence and risk appetite in the crypto markets.
- The bearish trend may influence trading strategies and market sentiment among other cryptocurrencies.
- The established resistance and support levels could dictate short-term trading decisions for investors.
- Further declines in Bitcoin may trigger sell-offs in other digital assets, potentially leading to a broader market downturn.
- Technical indicators suggest a strengthening bearish momentum, which may lead to increased volatility in the coming days.
