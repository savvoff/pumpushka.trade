## Overview

Crypto sentiment is showing signs of recovery as Bitcoin's price has risen above $90,000. This improvement in sentiment comes despite Bitcoin still trading below the $100,000 mark.

## What Happened

Bitcoin has experienced a notable upward movement, surpassing the $90,000 threshold. This price increase has contributed to a more positive outlook among investors in the cryptocurrency market. The current sentiment reflects levels previously seen when Bitcoin last traded above $100,000, indicating a shift in market perception.

## Why It Matters

The recovery in crypto sentiment is significant as it suggests renewed confidence among investors. A positive sentiment can lead to increased trading activity and investment in cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the movement above $90,000 may act as a psychological barrier, influencing market dynamics and investor behavior.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Improved investor confidence may lead to increased trading volumes.
- A positive sentiment could result in more investments in various cryptocurrencies.
- The movement above $90,000 may influence market trends and future price movements.
- A recovery in sentiment may attract institutional interest in the crypto market.
