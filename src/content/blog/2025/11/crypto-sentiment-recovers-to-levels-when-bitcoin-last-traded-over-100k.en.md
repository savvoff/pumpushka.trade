## Overview

Crypto sentiment is witnessing a recovery as Bitcoin has recently surpassed the $90,000 mark, even though it continues to trade below $100,000. This shift in sentiment may indicate a growing optimism within the cryptocurrency market.

## What Happened

Bitcoin's price has increased to above $90,000, leading to an improvement in the overall sentiment surrounding cryptocurrencies. Despite not reaching the significant milestone of $100,000, this upward movement suggests that traders and investors are becoming more positive about Bitcoin's potential.

## Why It Matters

The improvement in crypto sentiment is crucial as it can influence trading behavior and market dynamics. Positive sentiment often leads to increased buying activity, which can further drive prices higher. The fact that sentiment levels are recovering to those observed when Bitcoin last traded above $100,000 could signal a turning point in market attitudes.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Recovery in crypto sentiment may lead to increased trading volume.
- A rise in positive sentiment can attract new investors to the market.
- Improved sentiment could result in a potential upward trend in Bitcoin's price.
- The current sentiment reflects a historical context, indicating potential future movements.
- Market participants may feel more confident in their investments as sentiment improves.
