## Overview

The weekly chart for XRP is currently showing a compressed structure that indicates a potential major price movement. According to a recent analysis, this structure may lead to significant gains for XRP, particularly as it approaches a critical phase in its Elliott Wave pattern.

## Technical Analysis of XRP's Structure

### Elliott Wave Pattern

The analysis from a crypto analyst highlights an Elliott Wave pattern that began forming in June. This pattern includes a sequence suggesting that XRP is nearing a point of renewed momentum. The technical analysis illustrates that XRP has spent several months in a tightening structure, creating a narrowing triangle of support and resistance.

### Current Price Action

XRP is currently trading near the peak of this triangle, which suggests that volatility may soon return. The analysis outlines a five-wave structure originating from mid-June, where XRP experienced an initial rally, forming Wave One. This rally led to a new all-time high before the price action entered a corrective phase.

### Breakout Conditions

The analysis identifies two key levels defining XRP’s breakout conditions. The support level is around $2.22, which has remained stable throughout the consolidation phase. Conversely, the resistance level is set at $2.85, which has capped rally attempts since the summer. A weekly close above $2.85 would signal a transition from Wave 2 to an impulsive Wave 3. Conversely, a break below $2.22 would delay the bullish outlook.

### Fibonacci Extensions

Fibonacci extension levels indicate that after the anticipated Wave 3 expansion begins, significant price checkpoints will emerge. The initial target is close to a specific level, with a broader target positioned at another defined level. Following this, a pullback is expected before the final impulse of the broader structure completes.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- The analysis suggests a potential for significant price movement in XRP, which could influence market sentiment.
- A successful breakout above the resistance level may trigger increased trading activity and interest in XRP.
- The technical structure indicates that the cryptocurrency market may experience heightened volatility as XRP approaches key levels.
- Observers will closely monitor XRP's price action for indications of broader trends in the cryptocurrency market.
- The outcome of XRP's price movement could have implications for investor confidence in other cryptocurrencies as well.
