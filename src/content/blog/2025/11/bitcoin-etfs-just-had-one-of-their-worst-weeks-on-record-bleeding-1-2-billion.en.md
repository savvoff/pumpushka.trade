## Overview

Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have experienced significant outflows recently, with reports indicating that they had one of their worst weeks on record. Investors have withdrawn substantial amounts as the price of Bitcoin has declined.

## What Happened

In November, spot Bitcoin funds are approaching $4 billion in outflows. This trend has been primarily driven by investors choosing to cash out amid a notable decrease in the price of Bitcoin. The current situation reflects a growing trend of investors moving away from Bitcoin ETFs as market conditions shift.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Outflows from spot Bitcoin funds are nearing $4 billion in November.
- Investor sentiment appears to be shifting as the price of Bitcoin declines.
