## Overview

An analyst has raised concerns regarding Bitcoin's recent liquidation event, suggesting that it may not be over yet. There is a possibility that remaining leverage could lead prices to fluctuate in the range of $70,000 to $80,000.

## What Happened

The analyst's warning comes in the wake of a liquidation event that has already impacted Bitcoin's market dynamics. This event has raised questions about the extent of leverage still present in the market. With remaining leverage, there is a potential for Bitcoin's price to dip further, possibly landing in the $70,000 to $80,000 range. 

Understanding the implications of this analysis is crucial for traders and investors as they navigate the current landscape of Bitcoin's price movements.
