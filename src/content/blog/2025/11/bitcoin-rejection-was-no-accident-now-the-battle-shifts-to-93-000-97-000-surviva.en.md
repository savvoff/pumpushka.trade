## Overview

Bitcoin has faced a significant rejection at a resistance level, prompting a critical evaluation of its price movement. The focus now shifts to a survival zone between two specific price points that could dictate the future trajectory of Bitcoin.

## Recent Price Action

Bitcoin's recent rejection was not unexpected; it occurred precisely at the levels indicated by market charts. The price reacted at a micro-resistance zone, which spans a specific range, leading to a new lower low for Bitcoin. This development has intensified short-term bearish sentiment in the market.

### Resistance and Support Levels

The micro-resistance zone, defined by a specific range, proved effective in rejecting Bitcoin's price. Following this rejection, Bitcoin has now approached what is referred to as a major support zone. This zone is significant as it represents a critical checkpoint for Bitcoin’s price action. How Bitcoin reacts in this area could determine whether it stabilizes or continues to decline.

In addition, there is a smaller internal target zone identified, which is based on the evolving market structure. An extended projection zone has also been mapped, representing a broader outlook that aligns with established market patterns. While this projection indicates potential paths for Bitcoin, it remains contingent on market conditions.

### Demand Zone Importance

Currently, Bitcoin is positioned within a crucial decision zone. This area is essential for maintaining upward momentum, as it is viewed as the last significant support before potential further declines. A strong reaction in this zone could signal that buyers are attempting to regain control after recent selling pressure. Conversely, failure to demonstrate strength in this area could lead to a more pronounced bearish trend, with the next critical level identified as a significant support point.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Bitcoin's rejection at resistance reinforces short-term bearish sentiment.
- The critical survival zone between $93,000 and $97,000 may dictate future price movements.
- A strong reaction in this demand zone is vital for potential recovery.
- Failure to hold this area could lead to further declines and a shift in market sentiment.
- The outlook remains bearish unless Bitcoin can reclaim higher resistance levels.
