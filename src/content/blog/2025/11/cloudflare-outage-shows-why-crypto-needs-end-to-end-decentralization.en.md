## Overview

A recent outage at Cloudflare has highlighted a significant vulnerability in the crypto ecosystem. While many blockchains are designed to be decentralized, their frontends and storage solutions often depend on Web2 infrastructure, a reliance that can lead to disruptions.

## What Happened

During the Cloudflare outage, several platforms experienced downtime, as noted by EthStorage. This incident underscored the fragility of crypto projects that do not fully embrace decentralization in all aspects of their infrastructure. The reliance on centralized services for critical functions can lead to significant interruptions, affecting user access and overall platform reliability.

## Why It Matters

The incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges facing the crypto industry. Despite advancements in blockchain technology, the dependency on traditional Web2 services for frontend and storage solutions exposes vulnerabilities that can undermine the core principles of decentralization and security. As the crypto sector continues to evolve, addressing these weaknesses will be essential for building a more resilient infrastructure.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Highlights vulnerabilities in the reliance on centralized services for decentralized platforms.
- Raises awareness about the need for complete decentralization in crypto applications.
- Encourages discussions around improving infrastructure to reduce dependency on Web2.
- May lead to increased interest in decentralized storage and frontend solutions.
- Could influence future developments and innovations in the crypto space.
