## Overview

Recent market activity has seen Bitcoin bulls attempting to initiate a recovery, only to be met with significant selling pressure. This trend was echoed across the altcoin market, where many cryptocurrencies faced similar challenges.

## What Happened

Bitcoin experienced a push from bulls who aimed to trigger a recovery. However, this effort was thwarted as heavy selling pressure emerged around the $107,000 mark. This resistance level proved to be a barrier that prevented further upward movement. 

In addition to Bitcoin, most altcoins also encountered selling pressure as they approached their respective resistance levels. This widespread selling indicates a challenging environment for cryptocurrencies, as both Bitcoin and altcoins struggled to maintain upward momentum.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Bitcoin faced substantial selling pressure near a key resistance level.
- Most altcoins also experienced sell-offs from their respective resistance points.
- The market sentiment appears cautious, indicating potential challenges ahead for both Bitcoin and altcoins.
- The inability to sustain upward movement could affect trader confidence in the short term.
- Selling pressure highlights the ongoing volatility in the cryptocurrency market.
