## Overview

Grayscale Investments is set to launch spot ETFs for Dogecoin and XRP on November 24, 2025, marking a significant development in the accessibility of these cryptocurrencies for everyday investors. This move allows individuals to purchase these coins through traditional brokerages without the need to manage digital wallets or private keys.

## What Happened

Grayscale's decision to list the ETFs comes after receiving approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The funds will be traded under the tickers GDOG for Dogecoin and GXRP for XRP. This transition converts Grayscale's existing private-placement trusts into publicly traded products, bringing spot exposure to these cryptocurrencies into a more mainstream investment vehicle.

The approval and upcoming launch of these ETFs is particularly important as it enables access to Dogecoin and XRP for investors who may have previously avoided direct cryptocurrency investment due to concerns about custody and management. The introduction of these ETFs is expected to attract brokers, retirement plans, and funds that typically steer clear of direct crypto custody.

## Market Activity

In anticipation of the ETF launch, trading activity in related derivatives has seen significant increases. Reports indicate that Dogecoin derivatives volume rose by more than 30%, reaching approximately $7.22 billion, while XRP derivatives experienced a surge of about 51%, climbing to around $12.74 billion. These increases reflect traders positioning themselves for potential price movements surrounding the ETF debut.

Despite this activity, the broader cryptocurrency market has faced pressure, with reports noting a downturn lasting approximately six weeks. Currently, Dogecoin's market capitalization stands at $21.4 billion.

## Questions and Considerations

As the launch date approaches, several questions remain regarding investor demand and fund flows. Factors such as product fees, custody arrangements, and the conversion process of the trusts into ETF shares will likely influence investor interest. Historical trends from past crypto ETF launches have shown varying levels of early investor engagement, with some products experiencing brisk inflows while others have seen limited interest.

Market participants will closely observe the initial trading days for insights into demand for these ETFs. Indicators like high trading volume and tight spreads may suggest strong interest, while low turnover or wide spreads could indicate a lack of enthusiasm. Additionally, there is curiosity about whether the ETFs will attract the same speculative trading that has characterized recent derivatives activity.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- The launch of GDOG and GXRP introduces a new investment avenue for mainstream investors.
- Increased derivatives trading volume suggests heightened interest in Dogecoin and XRP ahead of the ETF launch.
- The approval of these ETFs may lead to greater liquidity in the markets for Dogecoin and XRP.
- The performance of these ETFs in their initial trading days could influence future investor sentiment and market trends.
- The ETFs could potentially attract institutional investors who prefer not to manage direct crypto custody.
