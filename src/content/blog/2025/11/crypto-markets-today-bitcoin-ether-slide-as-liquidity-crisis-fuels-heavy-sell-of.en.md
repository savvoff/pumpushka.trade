## Overview

Crypto markets experienced a significant downturn, approaching April lows, as a persistent liquidity crisis intensified price fluctuations. Both Bitcoin and ether saw declines exceeding 10%, reflecting the market's vulnerability to liquidity issues.

## What Happened

On Friday, the crypto markets faced a sharp decline, driven by a continuing liquidity crunch. This situation has led to increased volatility, causing substantial price swings across major cryptocurrencies. The significant drop in prices for Bitcoin and ether highlights the challenges that the crypto market is currently facing.

## Why It Matters

The ongoing liquidity crisis is a critical factor affecting the stability of the cryptocurrency markets. A lack of liquidity can exacerbate price movements, leading to more significant sell-offs and market instability. The recent declines in Bitcoin and ether prices serve as a stark reminder of the challenges that investors and traders must navigate in this environment.
