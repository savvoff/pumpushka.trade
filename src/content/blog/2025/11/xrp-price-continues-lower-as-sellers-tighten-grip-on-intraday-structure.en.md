## Overview

XRP is experiencing a significant decline, having started a fresh downturn from a previous high. The price has shown bearish signs and could face further losses if it dips below a critical support level.

## Current Price Movement

XRP price began its latest decline from a level of $2.350, moving below the $2.320 zone. Currently, the price is trading below $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, indicating a bearish trend. A short-term bearish trend line has formed, with resistance identified at $2.2550 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.

Despite an attempt to recover above $2.320, XRP failed to sustain upward momentum, similar to trends observed in other cryptocurrencies. The price has dropped below key levels including $2.30 and $2.250, and a low was recorded at $2.155. Currently, XRP is consolidating losses while exhibiting a bearish angle.

There was a minor move above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent decline, but the price remains below $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If an upward move occurs, resistance is anticipated near the $2.2550 level. The first significant resistance is near the $2.30 level, and if surpassed, it could lead to a test of $2.350.

## Potential for Further Decline

If XRP does not manage to clear the $2.350 resistance zone, it may initiate another decline. Initial support is found near the $2.20 level, with a major support level at $2.150. A close below this level could trigger further declines towards $2.050, with additional support at the $2.020 zone and potentially lower towards $1.880.

### Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for XRP/USD is currently gaining pace in the bearish zone.
- **Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: The RSI for XRP/USD is below the 50 level.
- **Major Support Levels**: $2.20 and $2.150.
- **Major Resistance Levels**: $2.30 and $2.350.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- The decline in XRP's price reflects broader bearish trends in the cryptocurrency market.
- Failure to maintain support levels could lead to increased selling pressure across similar assets.
- Resistance levels may influence market sentiment and trading strategies for XRP and other cryptocurrencies.
- The performance of XRP may affect investor confidence in altcoins, particularly in relation to Bitcoin and Ethereum's price movements.
- Ongoing bearish indicators could prompt traders to adopt more cautious strategies in the current market environment.
