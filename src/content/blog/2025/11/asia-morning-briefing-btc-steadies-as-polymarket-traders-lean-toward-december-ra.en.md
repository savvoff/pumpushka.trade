## Overview

Recent developments in the crypto markets have led to a sense of stabilization, particularly for Bitcoin. Rising expectations regarding a potential shift in Federal Reserve policy have contributed to this calm, as traders begin to adjust their strategies.

## Market Developments

The increasing likelihood of a Federal Reserve pivot has had a significant impact on the crypto markets, particularly with Bitcoin. This shift in sentiment has been observed by QCP and Glassnode, which suggest that there is a reset occurring in leverage within the market. This reset is characterized by a decline in selling pressure, indicating that traders are starting to position themselves more cautiously.

Additionally, there are early signs of a bottoming structure emerging in the market. Traders are hedging against potential downside risks while also preparing for possible upside in the latter part of the year. This dual approach reflects a growing confidence among market participants as they navigate the evolving economic landscape.
