## Overview

XRP has recently experienced a significant surge in market momentum, reaching a critical bullish target identified by a well-known trader. This development has bolstered confidence within the cryptocurrency community, coinciding with increased institutional interest and multiple ETF launches.

## Technical Breakout: Bull Flag Target Achieved
