## Overview

Aave, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lender, is set to launch a retail crypto yield application on Apple's App Store. This new app aims to provide users with the opportunity to earn attractive yields on their cryptocurrency deposits.

## What Happened

The Aave App will enable users to earn an annual yield exceeding 5% on their deposits. According to Aave, this yield is higher than what is typically offered by traditional money market funds. The launch of this application signifies Aave's commitment to expanding its services beyond institutional clients and into the retail market, making crypto yield opportunities more accessible to everyday users.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The launch of the Aave App could attract a broader audience to the crypto space.
- Higher yields offered by the app may encourage users to consider cryptocurrency as a viable alternative to traditional savings options.
- The app's availability on a major platform like Apple's App Store could enhance the legitimacy and visibility of DeFi products.
- Increased participation in DeFi may lead to more liquidity in the crypto market.
- The move reflects a growing trend of established DeFi protocols targeting retail investors.
