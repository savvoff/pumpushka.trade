## Overview

Bitcoin has recently slipped below $90,000, marking a significant decline from its recent all-time high. This movement has sparked discussions among crypto executives about potential opportunities in the current market landscape. 

## Recent Developments

This week, Bitcoin fell below the $90,000 threshold, a level not seen in seven months, according to trading data. Traders observed fluctuations around $90,700, placing Bitcoin approximately 25% lower than its recent peak of just over $126,000, reached on October 6. Analysts noted that a significant liquidation event on October 10 continues to influence market sentiment.

### Analyst Perspectives

In a CNBC interview, BitMine chairman Tom Lee highlighted the impact of the October 10 liquidations and ongoing uncertainty regarding potential rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve in December. He mentioned signs of exhaustion among sellers and referenced technical analyses that suggest a potential bottom may be approaching. Both Lee and Bitwise Asset Management's chief investment officer, Matt Hougan, indicated that crypto prices are nearing a bottom. Hougan described the current pricing as a "generational opportunity," encouraging long-term investors to take notice. He also pointed out that market jitters concerning the economy, elevated AI valuations, and US tariffs may have contributed to the selling pressure.

### Selling Trends

According to XWIN Research, short-term holders were primarily responsible for the recent decline in Bitcoin's price. Their analysis indicated that the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio dropped below 1 multiple times, suggesting that many short-term owners sold at a loss. Furthermore, they noted that coins held for less than three months accounted for most of the spent volume during the price drop, indicating panic-driven exits by recent buyers. In contrast, metrics like Coin Days Destroyed, Realized Profit, and Long-Term Holder Net Position Change showed increased distribution by long-term holders since September, but XWIN argued that this behavior aligns with routine profit-taking during a bull market rather than a sign of mass selling at a market peak.

### External Influences

Reports have indicated that outflows from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and large sell-offs by whale investors further contributed to Bitcoin's weakness. Rising geopolitical tensions have also added an extra layer of risk to the market. Market participants noted that Bitcoin began to weaken before other risk assets, which some investors interpreted as a warning signal for broader financial markets.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Bitcoin's drop below $90,000 has raised concerns among traders and analysts regarding market stability.
- The significant liquidation event on October 10 continues to reverberate through trading desks.
- Analysts suggest a potential bottom may be approaching, which could attract long-term investors.
- Short-term holders contributed significantly to the recent price decline, indicating a trend of panic selling.
- External factors, including ETF outflows and geopolitical tensions, are influencing market dynamics.
- The outlook for Bitcoin may depend on the performance of equities and macroeconomic policies in the near future.
