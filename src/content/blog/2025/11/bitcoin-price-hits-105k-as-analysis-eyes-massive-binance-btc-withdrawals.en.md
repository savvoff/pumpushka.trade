## Overview

Bitcoin's price has reached $105,000, continuing its trend of higher lows observed in November. However, traders are exercising caution due to the possibility of a rejection at critical resistance levels.

## Recent Developments

Bitcoin's recent price movement has followed a consistent pattern of higher lows throughout November, culminating in its rise to $105,000. This upward trend highlights the cryptocurrency's momentum in the market. Despite this positive movement, traders are wary of potential resistance that could lead to a price pullback. 

The situation is further complicated by significant withdrawals of Bitcoin from Binance. These withdrawals have drawn attention from analysts, who are closely monitoring the implications for market dynamics. The combination of rising prices and substantial withdrawals may signal underlying shifts in trading behavior and investor sentiment.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Bitcoin's price increase to $105,000 demonstrates its resilience and ongoing bullish sentiment among traders.
- The trend of higher lows suggests a potential strengthening of support levels, which could influence investor confidence.
- Traders' caution regarding resistance levels indicates a level of uncertainty that could affect market volatility.
- Significant withdrawals from Binance may impact liquidity and trading strategies within the market.
- Analysts are likely to continue monitoring these developments for insights into future price movements.
