## Overview

Peter Schiff has expressed concerns regarding the current state of Bitcoin holders, particularly those he refers to as "weak" hands. He believes that these new holders lack the conviction needed to hold onto their investments during turbulent market conditions, which could lead to increased selloffs.

## What Happened

According to Schiff, the selling behavior of Bitcoin's original holders, or "OGs," is contributing to a growing trend where newer investors are likely to sell their assets at the first indication of market trouble. This lack of confidence among these "weak" hands could exacerbate market drawdowns, leading to more significant price declines. The dynamics of selling pressure from these less experienced holders may impact overall market stability.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased selling pressure from new Bitcoin holders could lead to deeper market drawdowns.
- A lack of conviction among investors may result in higher volatility within the Bitcoin market.
- The behavior of "weak" hands could create a feedback loop, where initial selloffs prompt further selling.
- The potential for worsening market conditions may discourage new investment in Bitcoin.
- Original Bitcoin holders may need to adapt their strategies in response to the changing investor landscape.
