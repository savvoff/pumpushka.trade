## Overview

Bitcoin has recently experienced a decline, reflecting broader economic uncertainties. This downturn is attributed to unreliable economic data and changing expectations regarding U.S. growth and policy, which have shaken investor confidence.

## What Happened

Bitcoin's recent weakness is not occurring in isolation; it mirrors a wider trend in risk markets. The prevailing economic landscape is marked by unreliable economic data that has raised questions among investors. Additionally, shifting expectations concerning U.S. economic growth and policy decisions have contributed to a sense of instability in the market. This combination of factors has led to a decline in investor confidence, causing a sell-off in both Bitcoin and other risk assets.
