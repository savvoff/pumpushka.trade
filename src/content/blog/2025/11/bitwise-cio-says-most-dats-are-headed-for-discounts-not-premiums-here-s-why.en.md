## Overview

Bitwise's Chief Investment Officer, Hougan, has expressed concerns about the future of Digital Asset Trusts (DATs). He suggests that the structural challenges facing these trusts will likely lead them to trade at discounts rather than premiums.

## What Happened

Hougan's analysis highlights that the inherent structural drag within DATs is significant. This drag is expected to overshadow the limited and uncertain opportunities available for firms to improve their crypto-per-share values. The implications of this structural drag are critical for investors and the overall market perception of DATs.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The outlook for DATs suggests a trend towards discounts, which may affect investor sentiment.
- Potential investors might reconsider their strategies regarding DATs in light of the anticipated structural challenges.
- The discussion could lead to increased scrutiny of how firms manage and promote their Digital Asset Trusts.
- A focus on structural issues may shift investment flows away from DATs towards alternative crypto investment vehicles.
- The broader implications for the crypto market include potential volatility as investors react to these insights.
