## Overview

Tensions have escalated within the cryptocurrency community following reports that Strategy and other crypto treasury companies may be excluded from significant market indexes. This situation has prompted calls for a boycott of JP Morgan from Bitcoin supporters.

## What Happened

Recent developments indicated that Strategy, along with various crypto treasury companies, could face exclusion from major market indexes. This potential exclusion has sparked a backlash, particularly among supporters of Bitcoin. The discontent is largely directed towards JP Morgan, as stakeholders in the crypto space express their frustration and rally for a boycott.

## Why It Matters

The exclusion of crypto treasury companies from major market indexes can have several implications. It may limit the visibility and accessibility of these companies within traditional financial markets, potentially hindering their growth and acceptance. Furthermore, the call for a boycott reflects the broader tensions between the cryptocurrency sector and traditional financial institutions, highlighting ongoing challenges in the integration of digital assets into mainstream finance.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased tension between cryptocurrency advocates and traditional financial institutions.
- Potential limitations on the growth and integration of crypto treasury companies.
- A rallying point for Bitcoin supporters, emphasizing community solidarity.
- Possibility of further actions or movements aimed at challenging traditional finance practices.
- Heightened awareness of the challenges faced by crypto companies in gaining acceptance in broader markets.
