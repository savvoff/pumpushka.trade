## Overview

Recent developments have sparked tension in the crypto community, particularly among Bitcoin supporters. The controversy centers around the potential exclusion of Strategy and other crypto treasury companies from significant market indexes.

## What Happened

The call for a 'boycott' of JP Morgan arose after reports indicated that Strategy and similar crypto treasury firms would likely not be included in major market indexes. This exclusion is significant as it could limit the visibility and integration of these companies within mainstream financial markets.

## Why It Matters

The exclusion from major market indexes could have several implications for crypto treasury companies. It raises concerns about the recognition and acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional financial systems. Furthermore, the call for a boycott highlights the frustrations within the crypto community regarding perceived biases from established financial institutions.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased tensions between crypto advocates and traditional financial institutions.
- Potential for diminished visibility of crypto treasury companies in mainstream markets.
- Heightened calls for unity and action among Bitcoin supporters.
- Possible implications for future regulatory discussions regarding cryptocurrency and traditional finance.
- Increased scrutiny on the role of major banks in the evolving crypto landscape.
