## Overview

A well-known crypto analyst, recognized for predicting Bitcoin's significant drop in 2021, has issued a new warning regarding Solana. This alert highlights critical resistance levels that Solana must reclaim to avoid further declines in its price.

## What Happened

The analyst, who has a history of accurately forecasting market movements, conducted a technical analysis of Solana's price structure. He identified a crucial resistance zone that spans between two specific price points. According to his analysis, reclaiming this zone is essential for Solana to prevent a deeper correction in its ongoing downtrend.

The analyst has maintained a bearish outlook on Solana for an extended period. His recent observations indicate that Solana has faced multiple rejections at this key resistance area, suggesting that sellers are still dominating the market despite some accumulation. He noted that a specific price level has acted as a persistent ceiling for several months. As long as Solana's trading remains significantly below this level, the market is considered structurally weak.

Currently, Solana's price has retreated to mid-range levels, and early indications of a bearish breakdown have started to appear on the weekly timeframe. The analyst previously emphasized that unless buyers intervene quickly, the price could fall to a designated support level. At the time of his analysis, Solana was trading at a certain value, indicating a potential decline if the support level is not maintained.

Additionally, the analyst presented a High-Time Frame (HTF) chart, which he described as one of the most bearish he has encountered in recent months. This chart demonstrated a clear rejection from the upper boundary, highlighting the emerging weakness in higher timeframes. He remarked on the unusual silence surrounding potential risks, suggesting that this lack of discussion may indicate underlying vulnerabilities in Solana's market position.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The bearish outlook on Solana may lead to increased caution among investors and traders.
- A failure to reclaim the identified resistance zone could trigger further selling pressure.
- The ongoing downtrend in Solana may negatively influence broader market sentiment.
- Heightened volatility in the crypto market could result from the current uncertainty surrounding Solana's price action.
- The analyst's insights may prompt a reassessment of risk by traders focusing on altcoins.
