## Overview

Recent sentiment surrounding Bitcoin has significantly declined following its drop below $100,000. This shift has prompted a wave of bearish predictions from analysts, who believe that the cryptocurrency may continue its downward trajectory.

## Current Sentiment and Predictions

Bitcoin's price decline has led to various bearish forecasts, with analysts suggesting that the worst may not be over. One analyst, known as Mr. Wall Street, has indicated that Bitcoin has already reached its cycle top, implying a downward trend from this point. According to the analysis, while there may be temporary price reversals, they are expected to be short-lived and will likely precede further declines.

As Bitcoin struggles to regain the $100,000 mark, Mr. Wall Street has identified the $74,000-$82,000 range as the next significant level to watch. This indicates the potential for a drop exceeding 10% from its current levels. Furthermore, the analyst anticipates that Bitcoin may enter another bearish phase, projecting that by the end of 2026, it could fall below $60,000, possibly reaching as low as $54,000. This range is seen as a potential buying opportunity for those looking to invest ahead of a future upward movement.

### Technical Analysis

The bearish outlook is further supported by other analysts, including Leshka.eth, who has noted the completion of a head and shoulders pattern in Bitcoin's price chart. This pattern suggests that the cryptocurrency is in a reset phase, which is expected to continue. Leshka.eth also forecasts a significant decline, estimating that Bitcoin could drop over 40% from its all-time highs, potentially reaching as low as $40,000.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Declining sentiment around Bitcoin may influence investor confidence in the broader cryptocurrency market.
- Analysts' predictions of further price drops could lead to increased selling pressure among investors.
- The identification of key price levels may create volatility as traders react to potential support and resistance zones.
- A prolonged bearish phase could deter new investments and participation in the crypto market.
- The anticipated price movements may affect trading strategies and investment timelines for both retail and institutional investors.
