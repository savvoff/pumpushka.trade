## Overview

Bitcoin is currently facing significant selling pressure, struggling to reclaim the $90,000 level as market sentiment turns increasingly bearish. The recent price action has led to speculation about a potential peak in the current cycle, with some analysts suggesting the onset of a bear market.

## Market Dynamics

The decline from Bitcoin's all-time high has prompted a rapid shift in sentiment among traders. Many are now questioning the sustainability of the bullish structure that previously characterized the market. While a segment of participants holds an optimistic view, believing the correction is part of a broader continuation pattern, the prevailing sentiment is one of fear and uncertainty.

Notably, a shift in trader behavior has occurred, as observed by analyst Darkfost. He notes that many investors who attempted to long the market during the downturn have been squeezed out. This change is reflected in the funding rates, which have cooled and even turned negative, signaling a shift toward short positions. Darkfost emphasizes that this transition is not merely superficial; it indicates a stronger tilt toward aggressive short positioning.

The negative funding rates suggest a behavioral change among derivatives traders, moving from forced long unwinds to conviction-based short exposure. Historically, such shifts tend to happen only after a correction has progressed significantly, often coinciding with trader capitulation. This capitulation indicates a point where traders who resisted the downtrend begin to follow momentum, although typically after most of the move has already occurred.

In the context of Bitcoin's price action, the cryptocurrency is attempting to stabilize after a sharp decline. Currently trading around $87,000, Bitcoin has seen a rebound from a recent plunge near $80,000. Despite this bounce, the overall downtrend remains intact, as Bitcoin continues to trade below key moving averages, signaling persistent bearish momentum.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Selling pressure continues to dominate, with Bitcoin struggling to reclaim critical support levels.
- A shift in funding rates to negative indicates a strong dominance of short positions among traders.
- The market is experiencing a behavioral change, with traders capitulating to the downtrend and flipping to short exposure.
- Previous support levels have turned into resistance, raising concerns about renewed selling pressure.
- A potential consolidation phase may be forming above the $85,000 level, but the market remains fragile.
- The lack of strong volume support in recent recovery attempts suggests that buyers have yet to return with conviction.
