## Overview

A former Olympic snowboarder has been labeled a "drug kingpin" and is now subject to U.S. sanctions. The FBI is actively pursuing him in Mexico due to his alleged involvement in a crime empire that utilizes cryptocurrency.

## What Happened

The U.S. Treasury has sanctioned a former Olympic snowboarder who has transitioned into a criminal figure. This individual is accused of leading a drug trafficking operation that reportedly leverages cryptocurrency for its activities. The FBI is currently engaged in efforts to locate and apprehend him in Mexico.

## Why It Matters

The situation highlights the intersection of sports, crime, and technology, particularly the use of cryptocurrency in illicit activities. The sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury serve to underscore the government's stance on combating drug trafficking and the innovative methods employed by criminals, including the utilization of digital currencies.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased scrutiny on the use of cryptocurrency in illegal activities.
- Potential for regulatory responses targeting cryptocurrency transactions.
- Heightened awareness of the risks associated with crypto use in crime.
- Possible implications for legitimate cryptocurrency businesses and users.
