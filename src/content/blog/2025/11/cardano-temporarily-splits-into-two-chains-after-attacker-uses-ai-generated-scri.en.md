## Overview

Cardano has experienced a temporary split into two chains due to an exploit involving a malformed transaction. This incident occurred when newer nodes accepted a transaction that was rejected by older nodes, highlighting a critical issue within the network.

## What Happened

A divergence within the Cardano blockchain occurred when certain nodes began to accept a malformed transaction. This transaction was created using an AI-generated script that exploited a known bug in the system. The result was a split where newer nodes processed the transaction, while older nodes did not recognize it, leading to two separate chains operating simultaneously.

This situation is significant as it underscores the vulnerabilities that can exist within blockchain networks, particularly when it comes to node compatibility and transaction validation. The incident raises concerns about the integrity and reliability of the Cardano network, as well as the potential risks associated with AI-generated exploits.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The split in the Cardano blockchain raises concerns about network stability and security.
- The incident may affect user confidence in Cardano’s ability to handle transactions reliably.
- Potential implications for developers regarding the need for stronger safeguards against similar exploits.
- The event could influence how other blockchain projects approach their own security measures.
- Market participants may reassess their strategies regarding investments in Cardano.
