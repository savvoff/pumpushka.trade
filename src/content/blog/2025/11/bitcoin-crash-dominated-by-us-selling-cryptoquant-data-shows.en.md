## Overview

Recent analysis from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has highlighted significant selling activity from U.S. Bitcoin investors during the latest market downturn. This trend is underscored by the Coinbase Premium Gap, which indicates a preference for selling among American traders compared to their global counterparts.

## Key Findings

### Coinbase Premium Gap

CryptoQuant discussed the "Coinbase Premium Gap," which measures the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and Binance. The firm noted that the 30-hour moving average of this metric has recently dropped into negative territory. A negative Coinbase Premium Gap suggests that Bitcoin is trading at a lower price on Coinbase, which is primarily favored by American investors, particularly large institutional entities. This indicates heightened selling pressure from U.S.-based traders compared to global investors.

### Selling Pressure Indicators

The analysis revealed that the Coinbase Premium Gap fell as low as -$90, signifying strong selling pressure from the U.S. market. Additionally, the cumulative returns across different trading sessions showed that while European and Asia-Pacific trading hours have maintained a neutral return in Bitcoin over the past month, the American trading session experienced a significant negative return.

### ETF Outflows

Institutional investment in Bitcoin also appears to be declining, as evidenced by recent outflows from spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These investment vehicles, which hold Bitcoin on behalf of investors, have seen net outflows for three consecutive weeks. This marks a notable shift from the previous year's trend, where substantial amounts of Bitcoin flowed into ETF wallets. In Q4 2025, there has been a net outflow of 8,000 BTC compared to the influx of 194,000 BTC observed in Q4 of the previous year.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- Increased selling pressure from U.S. Bitcoin investors could lead to further price declines.
- The negative Coinbase Premium Gap indicates a potential shift in market dynamics favoring international investors.
- Continued ETF outflows may negatively impact the overall demand for Bitcoin in the spot market.
- The performance of spot ETFs may be closely monitored, especially regarding their cost basis, which could influence market sentiment.
- The overall downturn in the American trading session contrasts with the relative stability seen in European and Asia-Pacific markets.
