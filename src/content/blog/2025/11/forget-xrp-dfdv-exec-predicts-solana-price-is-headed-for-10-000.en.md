## Overview

A senior executive from DeFi Development Corp. (DFDV) has provided a bold long-term forecast for the price of Solana, suggesting it could reach $10,000. This prediction comes amidst recent market turbulence and reflects the executive's extensive experience in the crypto space.

## What Happened

Parker White, the COO and CIO of DFDV, shared his optimistic outlook for Solana after a challenging week for risk assets. He believes that Solana is well-positioned to capture a significant share of global digital value, which could drive its price substantially higher over the next decade. White's assertion comes in the wake of a notable decline in Solana's price, which has fallen by more than 25% in the past month. Currently trading at $137, a rise to $10,000 would represent an enormous increase.

As a Solana-focused treasury company, DFDV offers a unique approach to exposure in the market. White prefers to build his position through DFDV rather than through direct purchases of SOL or a Solana ETF. He described DFDV as a Digital Asset Trust (DAT), which is managed by him and a team that collectively holds more than 20% of the common stock. This concentrated ownership allows DFDV to grow its Solana holdings more aggressively than a passive ETF could.

In recent months, DFDV has reportedly achieved a 32% annualized increase in Solana per share after accounting for operating costs, outperforming the roughly 6% growth offered by ETFs after fees. White believes that the long-term success of DFDV hinges on achieving one SPS by late 2028, which he anticipates could create substantial wealth for executives and token holders willing to navigate market volatility.

## Why Volatility Is Central To DFDV’s Long-Term Outlook

White emphasized that volatility is not a drawback for DFDV but rather an essential component of its strategy. He expects significant volatility in the Solana market leading up to 2028. DFDV is designed to harness extreme market fluctuations to create long-term shareholder value. White also noted that while short-term traders may benefit from sharp price movements, long-term investors should focus on accumulating and holding their investments, even during volatile periods.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The aggressive forecast for Solana could attract attention from investors looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities.
- DFDV's unique structure may challenge traditional investment vehicles like ETFs, potentially shifting investor preferences.
- The emphasis on volatility suggests that market participants may need to adjust their strategies to capitalize on price fluctuations.
- Increased interest in Solana could lead to greater demand for the token, impacting its overall market dynamics.
- The forecast may inspire other market analysts to present their own long-term predictions, influencing market sentiment.
