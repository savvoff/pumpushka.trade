## Overview

In November, U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced significant outflows, totaling a record amount. This trend raises concerns about investor sentiment and the overall health of the cryptocurrency market.

## What Happened

## Impact on the crypto market
