## Overview

XRP has entered a significant phase in its development with the trading of Spot XRP ETFs in the United States. The growing interest from institutional investors and funds is leading to projections of substantial accumulation, which could drastically affect the available supply of XRP.

## Current Situation

The excitement around XRP has intensified as Spot XRP ETFs commence trading. Recent filings and inflow reports indicate a rising interest from institutional funds that are preparing to increase their exposure to XRP. Market commentator Chad Steingraber provided insights into how aggressive ETF accumulation could unfold, drawing parallels to the accumulation patterns seen with Bitcoin ETFs.

### Steingraber’s Projections

Steingraber outlined two scenarios for ETF accumulation:

1. **Modest Accumulation Model**: 
   - In this scenario, 12 Spot XRP ETF issuers are projected to acquire an average of 3 million XRP each day.
   - This would result in daily inflows of approximately 36 million XRP.
   - Over a standard five-day trading week, total accumulation would reach around 160 million XRP.
   - Over the course of a month, ETFs could absorb up to 720 million XRP.
   - If this pattern continues for a full year, an estimated 8.64 billion XRP could be removed from public circulation.

2. **Aggressive Accumulation Model**:
   - In a more aggressive scenario based on the performance of Bitwise’s Spot XRP ETF, daily acquisitions are projected at about 6 million XRP per issuer.
   - If 12 funds follow this pattern, the daily total could rise to approximately 72 million XRP.
   - Weekly totals could reach about 360 million XRP, and monthly totals could approximate 1.44 billion XRP.
   - Over a year, this model suggests that up to 17.28 billion XRP could be absorbed into ETF products.

These projections highlight the potential for rapid changes in XRP's supply dynamics, especially if larger issuers such as Grayscale, Bitwise, and others engage in significant accumulation.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The introduction of Spot XRP ETFs could lead to increased institutional participation in the XRP market.
- Significant accumulation of XRP by ETFs may result in reduced available supply, potentially impacting market dynamics.
- The projected inflows indicate a trend that could mirror the early patterns seen in Bitcoin ETF activities.
- The overall demand for XRP could increase if larger financial entities begin to engage with Spot XRP ETFs.
- The absence of moves from major players like BlackRock regarding Spot XRP ETFs may influence market perceptions and strategies.
