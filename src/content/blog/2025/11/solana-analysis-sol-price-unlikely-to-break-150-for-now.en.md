## Overview

Solana is currently facing challenges in its recovery, primarily influenced by decreasing network activity and a decline in total value locked (TVL). Additionally, negative flows from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have contributed to the overall market sentiment surrounding Solana.

## Current Situation

The Solana network is experiencing weakened activity, which indicates a potential slowdown in user engagement and transaction volume. This decline in network activity is significant as it can affect the overall health and adoption of the platform.

Moreover, the total value locked (TVL) in Solana has been decreasing, which may suggest a reduction in the amount of assets being utilized within the ecosystem. A declining TVL can impact the liquidity and market confidence in the platform.

Adding to these challenges, there have been negative flows from ETFs, which can further dampen investor sentiment and interest in Solana. These factors combined have led to a classic chart pattern that targets a price point of $100, indicating potential resistance around the $150 mark for the time being.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Decreased network activity may lead to lower user engagement on the Solana platform.
- A declining TVL can affect liquidity and confidence in the ecosystem.
- Negative ETF flows may contribute to diminished investor interest in Solana.
- The identified chart pattern suggests potential price resistance, which could influence trading strategies.
- Overall market sentiment may be affected by Solana's struggles, impacting broader crypto trends.
