## Overview

Solana is currently facing challenges in its recovery, primarily due to weakening network activity and a declining total value locked (TVL). Additionally, negative flows from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are contributing to the difficulties the network is experiencing.

## Current Situation

The Solana network has been struggling to regain momentum. One of the key factors affecting its recovery is the decline in network activity, which indicates a reduced level of engagement and utilization of the platform. Alongside this, the total value locked (TVL) within the Solana ecosystem is also on the decline, suggesting that there is less capital being invested or held in various projects built on the network.

Furthermore, the presence of negative ETF flows adds another layer of complexity to Solana's situation. These outflows can signal a lack of investor confidence and may further hinder the network's ability to recover.

A classic chart pattern is suggesting a potential target of $100, indicating that market sentiment may be leaning towards a more pessimistic outlook for Solana's price performance in the near term.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Weakening network activity on Solana may lead to decreased investor interest in the platform.
- A declining total value locked (TVL) could result in reduced funding for projects within the Solana ecosystem.
- Negative ETF flows may reflect broader market sentiment and impact investor confidence in Solana and similar assets.
- The potential chart pattern targeting $100 may influence trading strategies and decision-making among market participants.
- Overall, these factors could contribute to a challenging environment for Solana in the short term.
