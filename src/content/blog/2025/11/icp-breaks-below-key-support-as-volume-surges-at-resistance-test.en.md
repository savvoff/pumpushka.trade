## Overview

ICP has experienced significant trading activity as it attempts to rebound but ultimately fell below a crucial support level. This movement has resulted in increased consolidation and heightened short-term downside risk.

## What Happened

During a recent trading session, ICP faced heavy trading activity amid a failed attempt to rebound. This resulted in the asset dropping into a tighter consolidation zone situated beneath the $4.95 mark. The failure to maintain its position above this key support level indicates a challenging environment for ICP, as the increased trading volume suggests heightened market activity and interest.

## Impact on the crypto market

- ICP's drop below the support level may signal increased volatility in the short term.
- The failed rebound attempt illustrates the challenges faced by traders in the current market conditions.
- Increased trading volume during this period could indicate a shift in market sentiment.
- The consolidation zone below $4.95 may attract further attention from market participants.
- Short-term downside risk remains a concern for ICP as it navigates this consolidation phase.
