## Overview

Wemade has formed a new alliance called GAKS, which includes partners such as Chainalysis, CertiK, and SentBe. This collaboration aims to support the development of a compliant KRW stablecoin mainnet after experiencing several setbacks in the past.

## What Happened

Wemade's GAKS alliance is a strategic move to bring together key players in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. The inclusion of Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis company, CertiK, a security-focused firm, and SentBe, a payment solutions provider, indicates a focused effort to create a stablecoin that adheres to regulatory standards. This initiative comes after a series of challenges that have hindered previous attempts to launch a KRW stablecoin.

The formation of this alliance highlights Wemade's commitment to overcoming past obstacles and pushing forward with their goal of establishing a compliant stablecoin in the KRW market. By collaborating with established companies in the industry, Wemade aims to leverage their expertise to ensure the success of this project.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The formation of the GAKS alliance signals a renewed effort to develop compliant stablecoins in the cryptocurrency market.
- Collaboration with established firms may enhance the credibility and security of the proposed KRW stablecoin.
- The initiative could influence other companies in the industry to pursue similar partnerships for stablecoin projects.
- A successful launch of the KRW stablecoin could potentially increase interest and investment in the South Korean crypto market.
- The focus on compliance may set a precedent for future stablecoin developments, emphasizing the importance of regulatory adherence.
