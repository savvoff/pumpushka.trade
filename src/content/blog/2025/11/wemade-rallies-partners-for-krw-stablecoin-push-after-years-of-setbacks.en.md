## Overview

Wemade has formed a new alliance, known as the GAKS alliance, in an effort to advance the development of a compliant KRW stablecoin mainnet. This initiative comes after the company faced multiple setbacks in its previous attempts.

## What Happened

Wemade's GAKS alliance includes notable partners such as Chainalysis, CertiK, and SentBe. This collaboration aims to address compliance issues related to the creation of a KRW stablecoin, which has been a challenging endeavor for the company in the past. The involvement of these partners is significant as they bring expertise in areas such as blockchain analytics, security, and payment solutions, which are essential for the successful launch and operation of a stablecoin.

## Why It Matters

The formation of the GAKS alliance signifies a strategic move by Wemade to leverage partnerships that can enhance the credibility and regulatory compliance of its stablecoin project. By aligning with established firms in the cryptocurrency space, Wemade may improve its chances of overcoming previous challenges and achieving its goals in the stablecoin market.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The collaboration may set a precedent for future partnerships in the development of compliant stablecoins.
- Increased focus on regulatory compliance could influence other crypto projects to prioritize collaboration with established firms.
- Successful implementation of the KRW stablecoin could enhance market confidence in stablecoins linked to fiat currencies.
- The involvement of firms like Chainalysis and CertiK may lead to improved security and transparency in stablecoin operations.
- This initiative could stimulate interest in the South Korean cryptocurrency market, potentially attracting more participants and investments.
