## Overview

Cboe is set to launch Bitcoin and Ether futures in the United States, featuring a unique structure that mimics perpetual contracts. This innovative approach allows for daily cash adjustments, providing a regulated platform for cryptocurrency trading.

## What Happened

Cboe's new futures contracts for Bitcoin and Ether are designed to offer a perpetual-style trading experience. By implementing daily cash adjustments, these contracts aim to replicate the characteristics of traditional perpetual contracts without the complexities often associated with them. This development marks a significant step in enhancing the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency trading in the US.

## Why It Matters

The introduction of these futures contracts is important for several reasons. First, it provides a regulated avenue for traders to engage with cryptocurrencies, potentially increasing participation in the market. Second, the structure of the contracts may appeal to both new and experienced investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin and Ether in a more familiar trading format. Lastly, this move by Cboe could influence other exchanges to explore similar offerings, further shaping the landscape of cryptocurrency futures trading.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Provides a regulated trading option for Bitcoin and Ether.
- May attract a broader range of investors to the cryptocurrency market.
- Encourages other exchanges to consider launching similar futures products.
