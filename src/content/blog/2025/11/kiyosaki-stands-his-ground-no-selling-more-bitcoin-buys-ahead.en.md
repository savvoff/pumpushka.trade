## Overview

Robert Kiyosaki, the finance author, has expressed his steadfast commitment to holding Bitcoin despite recent market downturns. He emphasizes that the current price drop is primarily due to liquidity issues rather than a change in Bitcoin's long-term value.

## Market Context

This week, the cryptocurrency market experienced significant volatility, with Bitcoin's price falling to a level not seen in six months. The decline was attributed to a notable slump in AI-related and technology stocks, which prompted many investors to retreat from riskier assets. Kiyosaki believes this market behavior is driven by individuals needing quick cash rather than a fundamental weakening of Bitcoin itself.

### Kiyosaki's Perspective

Kiyosaki remains patient during this downturn, citing that he does not depend on selling assets for daily expenses. His income from real estate and private investments allows him to avoid making hasty decisions during turbulent times. He has publicly stated that he will only consider selling once the market stabilizes.

### Learning from the Past

In his reflections, Kiyosaki acknowledges previous mistakes made during market downturns, where he reacted impulsively. He argues that these experiences have taught him valuable lessons about managing financial fear and failure, lessons that are often overlooked in traditional education. He believes individuals learn more effectively from their own errors.

## Recent Market Dynamics

Reports indicate that Bitcoin's price slipped by 10% over the week, coinciding with a broader trend of liquidation in the market. Nearly $900 million in Bitcoin long positions were liquidated, but this represented less than 2% of the total open interest. Analysts noted that while the selling pressure was significant, it did not escalate into a broader market breakdown, contrasting with previous sell-offs.

### Future Plans

Looking ahead, Kiyosaki intends to increase his Bitcoin holdings once market conditions improve. He points to Bitcoin's capped supply of 21 million coins as a critical factor for its long-term viability. Additionally, he encourages fans of his Cashflow board game to form small learning groups to maintain confidence amid market fluctuations.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Kiyosaki's steadfastness may encourage other investors to adopt a long-term view rather than panic sell.
- The recent downturn highlights the impact of external market pressures, particularly from the tech sector.
- Liquidation levels, while significant, indicate a controlled market reaction rather than widespread panic.
- Kiyosaki's emphasis on education and learning from mistakes may foster a more informed investor base in the crypto space.
- The overall market appears to be stabilizing, suggesting potential for recovery as liquidity issues are addressed.
