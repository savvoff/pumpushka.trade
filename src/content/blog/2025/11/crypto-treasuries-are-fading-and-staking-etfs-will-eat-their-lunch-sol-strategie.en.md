## Overview

Michael Hubbard, the Interim CEO of SOL Strategies, has expressed a critical view on the future of pure crypto treasuries. He asserts that the current market for these treasuries is not sustainable, signaling a potential shift in investment strategies within the cryptocurrency sector.

## The Decline of Crypto Treasuries

Hubbard's perspective highlights a growing concern regarding the viability of crypto treasuries. He emphasizes that the lack of sustainability in this market could lead to changes in how investors approach cryptocurrency assets. The implications of this viewpoint suggest that traditional methods of holding and managing crypto assets may no longer be effective in the evolving financial landscape.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The notion of unsustainable crypto treasuries may lead investors to reconsider their strategies.
- A shift away from crypto treasuries could increase interest in alternative investment vehicles, such as staking ETFs.
- The discussion around the sustainability of crypto treasuries may influence market sentiment and investor confidence.
- As investment preferences change, the dynamics of asset management in the crypto space could evolve significantly.
- The potential rise of staking ETFs may create competitive pressures on existing treasury models.
