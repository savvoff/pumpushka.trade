## Overview

Solana has experienced a significant decline, falling below the $150 mark. This drop has raised concerns about further bearish trends, as the price consolidates losses and faces potential challenges in recovering.

## Recent Price Movements

Solana's price began to decline after failing to maintain stability above the $162 level. It has since dropped below both the $155 and $150 support levels. The current trading status shows Solana below $150 and the 100-hourly simple moving average, indicating bearish momentum.

### Key Resistance and Support Levels

A bearish trend line is forming, with immediate resistance identified at the $148 level on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. If the price can defend the $142 or $140 levels, there may be a chance for a recovery wave. However, if Solana fails to rise above the $152 resistance, it is likely to continue its downward movement.

- **Immediate Resistance**: $148
- **Next Major Resistance**: $152
- **Main Resistance**: $160
- **Initial Support**: $142
- **First Major Support**: $140

If the price breaks below the $140 level, it could lead to a decline toward the $132 support zone. A close below this level may further push the price down to the $120 support in the near term.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Solana's decline below $150 reflects a broader bearish sentiment in the market.
- The inability to maintain key support levels may influence trader confidence and market stability.
- The formation of a bearish trend line indicates potential continued downward pressure on Solana's price.
- Resistance levels at $148 and $152 will be critical in determining the short-term price direction.
- The price movement of Solana could impact other cryptocurrencies, given its correlation with major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
