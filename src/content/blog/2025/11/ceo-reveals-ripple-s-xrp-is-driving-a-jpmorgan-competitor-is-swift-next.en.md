## Overview

Sal Gilbertie, the CEO of Teucrium Trading, has expressed strong support for Ripple and its cryptocurrency, XRP. He believes that Ripple has the potential to emerge as a competitor to JPMorgan Chase and possibly challenge traditional banking systems like SWIFT, especially if it secures a banking license.

## Ripple Positioned As New JPMorgan And SWIFT Rival

In a recent interview, Gilbertie elaborated on his views regarding Ripple, emphasizing its interconnected ecosystem and growth potential. He indicated that Ripple is actively working towards becoming a fully operational financial institution, which could rival major banking players such as JPMorgan. Furthermore, Ripple has been frequently described as a competitor to SWIFT, aiming to provide a faster and more efficient solution for cross-border payments.

Gilbertie highlighted that acquiring a banking license would enable Ripple to operate with the same level of capitalization and operational discipline as leading banks. The company is currently pursuing a US national banking charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which, if granted, would make Ripple one of the first crypto-native firms to achieve this status.

In the interview, Gilbertie pointed out that XRP is central to Ripple's banking ecosystem. He stated that Ripple has no plans to sell XRP, viewing it as a strategic asset designed to increase in value through its integration into the XRPL ecosystem. He characterized Ripple as a “machine,” emphasizing its disciplined and coordinated operation, which allows for continuous innovation while maintaining a robust and interconnected network.

Gilbertie also claimed that Ripple is at the "center of the universe," suggesting its crucial role in potentially transforming the global banking landscape.

## Gilbertie’s Validation Confirms XRP’s Role

The interview between Gilbertie and Paul Barron has garnered positive reactions from the crypto community, with many interpreting his statements as validation of XRP's growing significance in institutional finance. Observers noted that a regulated traditional finance CEO recognizing Ripple as a rival to JPMorgan represents an important acknowledgment beyond typical industry speculation.

The timing of Gilbertie's endorsement coincides with the impending full enforcement of ISO 20022 standards and increasing inflows into XRP ETFs. Diana, the XRP advocate who shared the interview, emphasized that Gilbertie’s comments indicate a convergence of infrastructure, compliance, and institutional interest. She suggested that price movements often follow these developments, hinting at potential growth for XRP as the necessary conditions are established.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Gilbertie's endorsement may enhance Ripple's credibility in the traditional finance sector.
- Increased institutional interest could lead to more significant investments in XRP and Ripple's ecosystem.
- The pursuit of a banking license could pave the way for regulatory acceptance of crypto-native institutions.
- The alignment of infrastructure and compliance with ISO 20022 standards may facilitate broader adoption of Ripple's solutions.
- Positive sentiment from key industry figures may influence market perceptions and drive interest in XRP.
