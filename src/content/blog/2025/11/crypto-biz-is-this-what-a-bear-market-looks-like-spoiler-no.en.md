## Overview

Bitcoin's price has recently dipped below $90,000, raising questions about the current state of the market. Despite this decline, significant financial activity continues as Republic and Kraken have entered into nine-figure deals, suggesting that major players remain active in the crypto space.

## Current Market Situation

The recent drop in Bitcoin's price below the $90,000 mark has led to speculation regarding the nature of the market. Typically, a bear market is characterized by declining prices and reduced investor confidence. However, the involvement of major financial entities like Republic and Kraken in substantial deals indicates that large investors may not share the same pessimistic outlook.

The deals struck by these companies reflect a robust interest in the crypto market, even in the face of price declines. This suggests that significant capital is still flowing into the industry, which could be a sign of underlying strength despite surface-level price movements.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The decline in Bitcoin's price could influence retail investor sentiment, potentially leading to increased caution.
- The nine-figure deals by Republic and Kraken highlight ongoing institutional interest in cryptocurrency, which could stabilize the market.
- Continued investment from major players may counterbalance negative market trends and support future growth.
- The divergence between Bitcoin's price and institutional activity suggests that the crypto market may not be experiencing a traditional bear market.
- Increased involvement from large entities could attract further investment and participation in the crypto space.
