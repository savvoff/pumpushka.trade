## Overview

The Philippines is embracing blockchain technology through a developer program supported by the crypto industry. This initiative aims to provide students in a remote province with their initial experience in on-chain building, addressing educational challenges in the region.

## What Happened

A new developer program, backed by the crypto industry, has been launched in the Philippines. This program focuses on introducing students to on-chain building, a crucial aspect of blockchain technology. By targeting a remote province, the initiative seeks to enhance the educational landscape, which has been struggling with foundational skills.

The move to implement this program is significant as it not only introduces innovative technology to students but also aims to bridge educational gaps. The exposure to on-chain building could potentially equip students with valuable skills that are increasingly relevant in today’s digital economy.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased interest in blockchain education in developing regions.
- Potential for a new generation of blockchain developers.
- Strengthened connections between the crypto industry and educational institutions.
- Enhanced understanding of blockchain technology among students.
- Opportunities for future projects and collaborations in the crypto space.
