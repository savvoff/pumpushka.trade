## Bitcoin Price Fails to Rebound, Keeping Struggle Intact Near Crucial Zones

Bitcoin's recent price action has seen it struggle to maintain momentum, finding support around $88,500. Although there has been a slight correction from recent losses, significant resistance levels exist that may hinder any potential recovery. 

### Current Price Action

Bitcoin has recently experienced a decline, trading below key levels of $93,000 and $92,500. The price is currently situated below the 100 hourly Simple Moving Average, indicating a bearish trend. A bearish trend line is forming, with resistance noted at $93,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Should the price settle below the $90,000 zone, it could face further downward movement.

### Hurdles to Recovery

The price of Bitcoin has struggled to remain above the $92,000 mark, with bearish sentiment pushing it lower. The bears have successfully driven the price beneath the $89,500 level, resulting in a low of $88,570. Although there has been an attempt at recovery, the price remains below both $93,000 and the 100 hourly Simple Moving Average. 

If Bitcoin bulls attempt to push higher, they may encounter resistance near the $92,500 level and the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent decline. Key resistance points are identified at $93,500 and the trend line, with further resistance potentially at $93,750. A close above this level could indicate a stronger upward movement.

### Potential for Further Decline

Should Bitcoin fail to surpass the $93,500 resistance zone, it may face another decline. Immediate support is identified near the $91,150 level, followed by more significant support at $90,500 and $90,000. If the price continues to drop, it could approach the $88,500 support level. The primary support level is noted at $86,500, below which Bitcoin may experience accelerated losses.

### Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: Currently losing momentum in the bearish zone.
- **Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Above the 50 level, indicating some bullish potential.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Bitcoin's struggle to maintain upward momentum could influence trader sentiment, potentially leading to increased caution in the market.
- Resistance levels may deter bullish traders, limiting potential upward movements and keeping prices volatile.
- The presence of strong support levels suggests that traders will closely monitor these zones for signs of further declines or recoveries.
- The bearish trend line indicates a prevailing negative sentiment, which could affect other cryptocurrencies linked to Bitcoin's performance.
- Market participants may adjust their strategies based on Bitcoin's inability to reclaim higher price levels, creating a ripple effect throughout the crypto market.
