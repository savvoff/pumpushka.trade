## Overview

XRP is approaching a significant turning point as it experiences fresh upward momentum intertwined with a developing expanding diagonal structure. This situation raises expectations for a potential breakout if buyers can maintain control.

## Recent Developments in XRP's Market Structure

Hov recently highlighted a notable shift in XRP’s market structure, revisiting a previous analysis that anticipated a potential push lower to complete a truncated low. Following that discussion, XRP has dipped further, marking a new low on the line chart in comparison to the wick from a liquidity sweep. However, the journey into that low has not been straightforward, revealing a more intricate structure than initially anticipated.

Initially, the drop seemed to present a simple three-wave corrective pattern. Upon closer examination, Hov identified that a valid expanding diagonal count is also emerging. Despite this unusual structure, the price action following the most recent low shows signs of strength. XRP is developing a clearer impulsive move upward, which may indicate the early stages of the momentum needed to establish the anticipated high-probability C/3 wave trade. While this early impulse does not yet confirm a full trend reversal, it does reflect a significant shift in market aggressiveness.

Hov maintains a bullish outlook as long as buyers continue to defend the support zone. The probability of a reversal scenario increases with sustained buying activity in this area.

## Breakthroughs and Indicators

According to TARA's latest update, XRP has successfully tapped the 0.5 retracement level and is displaying impressive strength on the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This reaction suggests growing momentum beneath the surface. A breakout above this zone would shift focus toward the next major target, aligning with the crucial 0.382 level. Reclaiming this area would signal that XRP might be carving out a true bottom.

Despite this promising setup, confirmation of a new trend remains elusive. Momentum is building, and price action is becoming increasingly impulsive, characteristics typically seen in the early stages of a macro Wave 3. Additionally, an external factor influencing XRP's trajectory is Bitcoin, which has recently reached its resistance zone. Bitcoin's next decision will significantly impact XRP's short-term direction, making this moment of hesitation particularly critical.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- XRP is nearing a significant turning point, which could influence broader market sentiment.
- The presence of an expanding diagonal structure indicates complex market dynamics at play.
- Strength shown in the RSI suggests potential upward momentum in XRP.
- Bitcoin's performance is critical, as its next movement will likely affect XRP's direction.
- The market is on the verge of confirming its next major leg, with attention on key price levels in the coming sessions.
