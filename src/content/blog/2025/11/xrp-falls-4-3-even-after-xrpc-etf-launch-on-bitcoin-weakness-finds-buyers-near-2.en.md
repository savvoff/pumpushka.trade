## Overview

XRP has experienced a decline of 4.3% despite the launch of the XRPC ETF. The cryptocurrency is facing challenges in gaining upward momentum, particularly in light of broader market conditions.

## Current Market Situation

The current market environment is characterized by bearish sentiments. XRP has been unable to surpass the resistance zone between $2.23 and $2.24. This struggle to gain traction is significant as it reflects the overall difficulties many cryptocurrencies are facing in a declining market.

The launch of the XRPC ETF was anticipated to provide support and potentially enhance interest in XRP; however, the persistent weakness in Bitcoin has overshadowed these developments. As a result, XRP has found buyers near the $2.22 level, but the inability to break through key resistance points raises concerns about its future performance.

## Impact on the crypto market

- XRP's decline indicates ongoing bearish trends in the cryptocurrency market.
- The resistance level between $2.23 and $2.24 remains a critical barrier for XRP.
- The launch of the XRPC ETF did not have the expected positive impact on XRP's price.
- Bitcoin's weakness continues to influence the performance of altcoins like XRP.
- Market participants are closely monitoring the situation for potential buying opportunities around $2.22.
