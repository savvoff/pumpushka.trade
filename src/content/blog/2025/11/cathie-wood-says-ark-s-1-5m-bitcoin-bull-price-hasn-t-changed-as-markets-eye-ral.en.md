## Overview

ARK Invest, led by Cathie Wood, maintains its bullish stance on Bitcoin, asserting that the projected price of $1.5 million remains unchanged. This optimism comes amid expectations of increased liquidity in the market following a potential government shutdown.

## What Happened

ARK Invest anticipates that an additional $300 billion in liquidity will flow back into the market after the government shutdown. This influx is seen as a potential remedy for the current "liquidity squeeze" that has been impacting valuations in both the cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence sectors. The return of liquidity could create a more favorable environment for investments and may lead to a resurgence in market activity.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased liquidity could enhance trading volumes and investor confidence in cryptocurrencies.
- A resolution to the liquidity squeeze might positively influence the valuations of crypto assets.
- The anticipation of government actions may drive speculative trading in the crypto market.
- Potential for renewed interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as investors respond to improved market conditions.
- ARK Invest's steadfast price projection may attract attention from institutional and retail investors alike.
