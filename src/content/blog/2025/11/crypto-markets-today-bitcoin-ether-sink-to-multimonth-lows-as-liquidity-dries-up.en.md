## Overview

The cryptocurrency markets experienced significant declines over the weekend, with major tokens such as Bitcoin and Ether hitting multimonth lows. This downturn is attributed to changing expectations regarding Federal Reserve rate cuts and a decrease in market liquidity.

## Market Developments

The weekend saw a continuation of a broader downtrend in the cryptocurrency markets. Major tokens were particularly affected, with Bitcoin and Ether reaching their lowest levels in several months. This decline was exacerbated by shifting expectations surrounding Federal Reserve rate cuts. As investors adjusted their outlook on monetary policy, the resulting uncertainty contributed to the downward pressure on prices.

Additionally, thin liquidity in the markets played a critical role in amplifying these declines. With fewer participants actively trading, even minor shifts in sentiment or expectations can lead to more pronounced price movements, creating a challenging environment for traders and investors alike.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether reached multimonth lows.
- Changes in Federal Reserve rate-cut expectations influenced market sentiment.
- Decreased liquidity in the markets contributed to the severity of the price declines.
- The overall downtrend reflects broader challenges facing the cryptocurrency sector.
- Market participants face heightened uncertainty amid shifting economic indicators.
