## Overview

Bitcoin Hyper is on a mission to transform Bitcoin into a fast and smart-contract-ready Layer 2 solution. The presale for its $HYPER token has successfully raised over $28 million, attracting significant interest from both whales and retail investors. This initiative aims to address Bitcoin's current limitations while positioning itself as a potential high-growth opportunity in the crypto market.

## What Happened

Bitcoin Hyper is designed to convert Bitcoin into a high-throughput Layer 2 network. It utilizes a Solana-style virtual machine and zero-knowledge proofs to enhance transaction speeds and lower costs. The presale has garnered considerable attention, raising over $28.16 million at a price of approximately $0.013305 per token. This influx of capital indicates strong demand, particularly from larger investors who have made substantial purchases.

The project allows stakers to lock their $HYPER tokens for yields around 41% APY. Over a billion tokens have already been committed, aligning the interests of early holders with the long-term growth of the network. Despite the potential for high returns, the project faces challenges, including competition and the inherent risks associated with delivery and market volatility.

Bitcoin continues to face scrutiny as it struggles with transaction speed and high fees, processing around seven transactions per second. Most decentralized finance (DeFi) activity remains on faster networks, creating a gap for Bitcoin Layer 2 projects like Bitcoin Hyper. This gap presents an opportunity for Bitcoin Hyper to capture market interest by offering a solution that enhances Bitcoin's capabilities while maintaining its security.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- Bitcoin Hyper's presale success reflects a growing interest in innovative Layer 2 solutions for Bitcoin.
- The project aims to address Bitcoin's limitations, potentially increasing its utility in the DeFi space.
- High yields for stakers could attract more investors looking for passive income opportunities.
- The participation of large investors suggests confidence in the project's potential to succeed.
- As the market shifts towards cautious dip-buying, Bitcoin Hyper could emerge as a notable player in the crypto landscape.
