## Overview

MoonPay has achieved a significant milestone by securing a trust charter in New York. This regulatory approval comes on the heels of the company obtaining a BitLicense from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) earlier in the year.

## What Happened

MoonPay's recent acquisition of a trust charter allows the payments company to expand its range of regulated services. This regulatory approval is particularly noteworthy as it positions MoonPay among a select group of cryptocurrency companies that hold both a BitLicense and a trust charter. The BitLicense, obtained in June from the NYDFS, is a critical regulatory requirement for companies operating in the cryptocurrency space within New York.

## Impact on the crypto market

- MoonPay's trust charter enhances its credibility and regulatory compliance in the cryptocurrency sector.
- The combination of a BitLicense and a trust charter may encourage other crypto companies to pursue similar regulatory pathways.
- This regulatory approval could lead to increased consumer trust and adoption of MoonPay's services.
- The move may set a precedent for future regulatory approvals in the cryptocurrency industry.
- It highlights the ongoing trend of regulatory frameworks evolving to accommodate cryptocurrency services.
