## Overview

MoonPay, a prominent crypto payments firm, has achieved a significant milestone by securing a Trust Charter in New York. This development allows the company to enhance its institutional crypto services, joining a select group of firms that possess both a BitLicense and a Trust Charter.

## What Happened

MoonPay's recent acquisition of a Trust Charter grants it the legal authority to custody assets, a crucial capability for institutional clients looking to manage and secure their digital assets. Additionally, this charter enables the firm to offer over-the-counter (OTC) trading services. The oversight by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) ensures that MoonPay operates within a regulated framework, which is essential for building trust among institutional investors.

This achievement positions MoonPay as a competitive player in the crypto market, particularly in the realm of institutional services. The combination of the BitLicense and Trust Charter signifies a robust regulatory compliance, which is increasingly important as the crypto industry matures and attracts more institutional participation.

## Impact on the crypto market

- MoonPay's Trust Charter enhances its credibility and regulatory compliance in the crypto space.
- The ability to custody assets and offer OTC trading may attract more institutional clients to MoonPay.
- The move reflects a growing trend of regulatory acceptance of crypto firms in the United States.
- Increased competition among crypto service providers may lead to improved services and offerings for institutional investors.
- Regulatory frameworks like those established by the NYDFS may influence other jurisdictions to adopt similar measures.
