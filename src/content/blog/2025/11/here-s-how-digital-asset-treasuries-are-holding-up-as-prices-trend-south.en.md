## Overview

Major crypto treasuries are experiencing significant paper losses as the market continues to trend downward. This situation has raised concerns regarding the potential for forced selling among these treasuries.

## Current Situation

This decline in value has prompted worries about the possibility of these treasuries being compelled to sell their holdings to cover losses or meet liquidity needs.

## Importance of the Situation
