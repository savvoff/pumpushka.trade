## Overview

A recent post on X highlighted the lineup of pending XRP ETF filings, eliciting a critical response from market commentator Robert Ledferd. He suggested that XRP's inability to reach double-digit prices once these ETFs are live could lead the market to view it as trivial.

## What Happened

The image shared on X showcased a comprehensive list of major firms preparing to launch XRP-related products, including well-known names in the finance sector. Ledferd’s remarks stem from the anticipation that the introduction of these ETFs would signify a shift towards significant institutional investment in XRP.

Ledferd emphasized that the number of issuers preparing XRP products indicates that institutional exposure is becoming a reality rather than a theoretical possibility. He noted that if XRP fails to rise to double digits once these ETFs are active, it may be regarded as the "joke of the year."

## Why It Matters

The expectation surrounding the launch of these ETFs is that they will lead to substantial institutional inflows into XRP, similar to what has been seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum. This expectation raises questions about the necessary price levels for XRP to reflect meaningful progress in the market.

To reach double digits, XRP must first break through and maintain support above the $3 to $3.65 price range, which has historically been a point of resistance. Achieving this would indicate that new buying pressure is outpacing selling pressure, suggesting genuine demand for XRP.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The anticipated launch of XRP ETFs could lead to increased institutional interest in XRP.
- If XRP fails to reach double digits post-ETF launch, it may negatively affect market perception.
- The performance of XRP could serve as a barometer for the effectiveness of ETF-driven institutional inflows.
- Market participants will closely monitor XRP's ability to break and hold above key price levels as a sign of potential growth.
- The valuation implications of XRP reaching double digits could significantly alter its market cap positioning within the crypto landscape.
