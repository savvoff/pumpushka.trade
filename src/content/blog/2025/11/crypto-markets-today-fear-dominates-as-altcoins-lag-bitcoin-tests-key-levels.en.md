## Overview

The crypto market is currently experiencing a period of fear, with Bitcoin facing challenges in regaining the $90,000 range. This struggle has led to a notable underperformance of altcoins, which are suffering from liquidity issues.

## Current Situation

Bitcoin's inability to reclaim the $90,000 range is significant as it indicates a lack of bullish momentum in the market. Investors are showing increased caution, which has resulted in a broader vulnerability across the crypto landscape. The underperformance of altcoins is particularly pronounced, with many tokens experiencing sharp declines driven by liquidity concerns. This scenario highlights the interconnectedness of Bitcoin's performance and the overall health of the altcoin market.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Altcoins are experiencing liquidity-driven underperformance, reflecting market anxiety.
- The broader vulnerability of the crypto market may lead to increased volatility.
