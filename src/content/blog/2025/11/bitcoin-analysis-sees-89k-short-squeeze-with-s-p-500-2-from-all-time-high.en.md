## Overview

Recent analysis surrounding Bitcoin suggests the potential for a significant short squeeze, as the cryptocurrency maintains pressure on a critical resistance level. Concurrently, US stocks are experiencing upward momentum, nearing their all-time highs.

## Current Situation

This situation is noteworthy as it reflects the market's current sentiment and the dynamics influencing Bitcoin's price movements.

In parallel, US stock markets are also performing well, approaching a notable milestone just 2% away from their all-time highs. The correlation between the performance of Bitcoin and traditional markets may be significant, as both assets navigate investor sentiment and market conditions.
