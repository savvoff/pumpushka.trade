## Overview

Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced significant outflows recently, totaling $866 million. This occurred as the U.S. government shutdown concluded, resulting in Bitcoin reaching a six-month low. The situation has raised concerns regarding market structure and investor demand.

## What Happened

The cessation of the U.S. government shutdown coincided with these outflows, suggesting a potential correlation between governmental stability and investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency market.
