## Overview

Hyperliquid (HYPE), the native token of a decentralized exchange, recently experienced a recovery after dipping below the $30 mark. This slight rebound comes as leading cryptocurrencies have begun to recover key levels, indicating potential upward movement for HYPE.

## Recent Developments

After falling below the $30 threshold, HYPE managed to recover by 2% on Thursday. Market analyst OxMakeSense has pointed out that HYPE is positioned for a new rebound, with discussions about a potential roadmap leading to a significant price level, just under its all-time high. The recent upward movement in the broader cryptocurrency market may contribute to this positive sentiment.

OxMakeSense has highlighted key levels that could be crucial for HYPE's trajectory. He noted that the price range of $37–$38 is significant, as it marks the point where HYPE experienced a breakdown previously. A recovery above this level could trigger a squeeze of "trapped sellers," further facilitating upward movement. If HYPE can surpass the $38 threshold, it may lead to a direct move toward the $41–$42 range, which is characterized by minimal resistance from earlier sell-offs.

However, the market remains cautious. Analyst Crypto TXG has raised concerns about HYPE's recent performance, noting a loss of the $35.8 level and a temporary bottom near $28.5. Currently, HYPE is testing the $35.8 level from below, which poses as a significant barrier. If HYPE can break through this resistance, it may set its sights on a target around $42.3. Conversely, if it fails to overcome the $35.8 barrier, a pullback could occur, possibly leading to a more decisive test of the $28.5 support.

Additionally, market expert Ali Martinez has suggested that if HYPE retests its breakdown zone, it might revisit the $25 mark, indicating potential for a short-term retracement.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The recovery of HYPE may reflect a broader positive trend in the cryptocurrency market as major assets regain key levels.
- Key resistance and support levels for HYPE are being closely monitored, with implications for trading strategies.
- Analysts' divided opinions highlight the uncertainty in market sentiment regarding HYPE's future price action.
- A potential retracement to lower levels could affect trader confidence and market dynamics for HYPE and similar tokens.
