## Overview

Dogecoin (DOGE) has demonstrated a steady increase, surpassing the $0.150 mark against the US Dollar. Currently, DOGE is consolidating its gains, with potential for a minor correction to around $0.1480.

## Recent Price Movements

Following a climb above the $0.1450 and $0.150 levels, Dogecoin has entered a bullish phase. The price reached a high of $0.1565 and is now stabilizing above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent upward move that began at a swing low of $0.1330. A bullish trend line is also forming, providing support at $0.1490 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair.

Currently, Dogecoin is trading above the $0.150 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If the price remains stable above $0.1480, there is potential for further increases. Immediate resistance is noted near the $0.1565 level, with additional resistance at $0.160 and $0.1620. A close above the $0.1620 resistance could lead to a price move towards higher levels.

## Potential for Decline

In contrast, if Dogecoin's price fails to surpass the $0.1565 level, a downside correction may occur. Initial support is positioned around $0.1510, followed by significant support at $0.1480 and the bullish trend line. The main support level is at $0.1450, coinciding with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the upward move. Should the price decline below the $0.1450 support, it could further slide toward the $0.1380 level or even $0.1330.
