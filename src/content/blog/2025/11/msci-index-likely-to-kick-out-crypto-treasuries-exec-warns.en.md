## Overview

Recent discussions have emerged regarding the potential exclusion of digital asset treasuries from the MSCI index. An executive has warned that if this decision is made, it could lead to significant selling pressure on affected assets held by index-tracking funds.

## What Happened?

The MSCI, a leading provider of global indices, is contemplating the removal of crypto treasuries from its index. This decision is crucial as many investment funds track MSCI indices. If the exclusion occurs, index-tracking funds will be required to divest from these digital asset treasuries. The executive highlighted that such a move would create meaningful pressure on the names that are impacted by this change.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Potential selling pressure on digital asset treasuries if excluded from the MSCI index.
- Index-tracking funds may be forced to liquidate holdings in affected assets.
- The decision could influence the overall market sentiment towards crypto assets.
- A significant shift in index composition may affect the valuation of certain cryptocurrencies.
