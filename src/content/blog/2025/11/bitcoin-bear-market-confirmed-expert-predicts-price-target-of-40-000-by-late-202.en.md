## Overview

Bitcoin (BTC) has shown signs of a slight recovery after hitting a near eight-month low. Despite this rebound, market experts are signaling that the cryptocurrency may be entering a distribution phase characterized by increasing selling pressure.

## Recent Price Movements

On Wednesday, Bitcoin reached a low of $87,500, but by Thursday, it surged back toward $90,000. This brief increase has raised concerns among analysts who suggest that it may only mark the beginning of a new distribution phase for Bitcoin.

### Expert Analysis

Market expert Leshka has evaluated Bitcoin's performance on the weekly chart and identified critical demand zones between $40,700 and $47,500. These levels could potentially represent the bottom for Bitcoin during the expected bear market, with significant declines suggested from current values. 

While Leshka acknowledges the potential for these lows, she remains optimistic about Bitcoin's long-term prospects, indicating that a rebound could lead to new all-time highs by 2027. However, in the short term, bearish sentiment prevails.

Analyst Ali Martinez has noted that the TD Sequential indicator has generated a sell signal for Bitcoin, which has historically been a reliable predictor of price corrections. Previous instances of this signal have led to substantial price drops, suggesting a median correction that could target around $40,000.

### Additional Bearish Sentiments

Technical analysis from Crypto Feras supports the prevailing bearish outlook. He noted that Bitcoin has breached its 50-day moving average (MA50), which could signal a period of reflection for the cryptocurrency. Feras indicated that initial support might be found at $88,500, which could facilitate a short-term bearish retest of the MA50 following this breakdown.

Feras also highlighted that additional support could be briefly retested at $84,000, which he suggested might represent a final bear trap before a more extended downturn. He emphasized that Bitcoin will remain in a bear market as long as it trades below its weekly MA50, and discussions about a potential bull market will only resume once this moving average is reclaimed.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The recent price movements and expert analyses indicate a potential ongoing bearish trend for Bitcoin.
- Analysts are highlighting critical support zones that could influence Bitcoin's future price trajectory.
- The sell signals from technical indicators suggest heightened selling pressure, which may affect investor sentiment.
- The possibility of significant price corrections could have implications for altcoins and the broader cryptocurrency market.
- Discussions about a shift to a bull market are currently premature, according to analysts, as long as Bitcoin remains below key moving averages.
