## Overview

Thailand has requested the deletion of 1.2 million iris scans related to the digital ID project known as World, which is backed by Sam Altman. This action follows the project's decision to halt its operations in Thailand due to concerns over compliance with local regulations.

## What Happened

The Thai authorities raised issues regarding the World project's adherence to the Personal Data Protection Act. As a result, the project has suspended its operations in the country. This suspension is significant as it highlights the regulatory challenges that digital identity initiatives may face, particularly concerning personal data management and privacy laws.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The suspension of World’s operations in Thailand may raise concerns among investors regarding regulatory compliance in digital identity projects.
- The request for deletion of iris scans emphasizes the importance of data protection and privacy in the growing digital identity sector.
- This incident could lead to increased scrutiny of other crypto and blockchain-related projects operating in regions with strict data protection laws.
- The halt in operations may affect the perception of digital ID solutions among potential users and stakeholders in the crypto ecosystem.
- Future collaborations between digital ID projects and governments may be influenced by this event, particularly in terms of regulatory compliance.
