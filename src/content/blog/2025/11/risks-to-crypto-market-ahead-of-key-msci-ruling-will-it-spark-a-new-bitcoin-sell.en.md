## Overview

The cryptocurrency market is facing significant turmoil, particularly for Bitcoin, which has reached an eight-month low. This downturn has been attributed to a series of events that began earlier this month, raising concerns about the future of digital assets and the classification of companies holding cryptocurrencies.

## Recent Market Developments

Bitcoin experienced a steep decline, marking a potential worst-performing week since November 2022. On October 10, the market suffered a brutal liquidation event that erased nearly $21 billion in value within minutes, leading to further flash crashes and increased fears within the industry. Analysts have identified this date as pivotal in the downward trend, as it coincided with the announcement from MSCI, a major index company.

The MSCI announcement questioned the classification of companies that primarily hold crypto assets, specifically whether they should be categorized as "companies" or "funds." This classification is critical because it affects eligibility for inclusion in passive indexing. If categorized as funds, these companies would not qualify for passive index tracking, which could lead to significant financial repercussions.

### Role of Digital Asset Treasuries

According to Ran Neuner, the founder of Crypto Banter, Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) have played a crucial role in the current market cycle. These firms, including Strategy, have been major buyers of cryptocurrencies, aiming to grow large enough for inclusion in significant indices. The objective of these firms is to create a self-reinforcing cycle where being included in indices leads to increased buying from passive index trackers.

If the MSCI ruling classifies these firms as funds, it could result in their automatic removal from indices, prompting pension funds and other passive investors to divest from these companies. This scenario poses a substantial threat to the market, as it could diminish the buying pressure that has supported current prices.

## Future Outlook

The outcome of the MSCI ruling, expected on January 15, 2026, will be pivotal for the crypto market. Should the ruling favor the classification of these companies as funds, a significant sell-off may occur as investors react to potential exclusion from indices. Conversely, a favorable ruling could pave the way for a renewed bullish trend in the market.

Currently, Bitcoin has shown slight recovery but remains significantly below its all-time high, which raises questions about its resilience and the overall market structure.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Bitcoin's recent decline raises concerns about market stability and investor confidence.
- The classification decision by MSCI could significantly affect the operational capabilities of companies holding crypto assets.
- A negative ruling may lead to a substantial sell-off, while a positive ruling could reinvigorate the market.
- Digital Asset Treasuries may face challenges that could impact their purchasing power and market influence.
- The overall sentiment in the crypto market is cautious as investors await the MSCI ruling.
