## Overview

Carlos Domingo, the CEO of Securitize, has navigated through challenging times in the tokenization space while other segments, such as NFTs, FTX, and memecoins, captured the spotlight. His efforts are now bearing fruit, marked by significant achievements including a SPAC listing in progress and partnerships with major financial institutions.

## The Journey of Carlos Domingo

Throughout the years, Carlos Domingo has been a pivotal figure in the tokenization industry, particularly during the periods often referred to as the "uncool years." During this time, while the market was flooded with excitement surrounding NFTs, FTX, and various memecoins, Domingo remained focused on the fundamentals of tokenization. His dedication to this innovative approach has led to substantial results, with billions in tokenized assets now under management.

Securitize, under Domingo's leadership, has established itself as a key player in the tokenization of assets. The firm has developed a platform that enables the issuance and management of digital securities, which are essential for modernizing the financial landscape. This focus on regulatory compliance and security has positioned Securitize favorably in a rapidly evolving market.

A significant highlight of Domingo's recent achievements is the company's planned SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) listing. This move is indicative of the growing recognition of Securitize's potential and the increasing demand for tokenized assets in the financial sector. Furthermore, having BlackRock as a flagship client and supporter underscores the credibility and trust that Securitize has garnered within the industry.
