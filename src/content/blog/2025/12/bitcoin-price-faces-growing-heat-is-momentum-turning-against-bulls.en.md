## Overview
Bitcoin's price has faced a notable downturn, trading below the $90,000 support zone. The cryptocurrency is currently attempting to recover but may encounter significant resistance at the $90,500 level. Understanding the recent price movements is crucial for gauging the market sentiment and potential future trends.

## Recent Price Movements
Bitcoin recently initiated a downside correction after reaching the $92,500 zone. The price fell below the $90,500 support level and even dipped below $88,000, indicating a strong bearish sentiment. However, buying interest emerged around the $87,500 mark, where a low of $87,582 was recorded. Following this, Bitcoin has started to rise, breaking above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of its downward movement.

As it stands, Bitcoin is trading below the $90,000 threshold and also the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A bearish trend line is forming, with resistance identified at $90,650 on the hourly chart for the BTC/USD pair. If Bitcoin can stabilize above the $90,500 zone, it may be set for another upward move. The immediate resistance levels to watch are near $90,000 and $90,500. A breakthrough above $92,000 could potentially lead to further gains, pushing the price toward the $92,500 resistance and possibly higher toward $93,200.

## Future Outlook
Conversely, if Bitcoin fails to surpass the $90,500 resistance, it may enter another phase of decline. The immediate support level is at $88,550, followed by major support at $88,000. A further drop could see Bitcoin test the $87,500 zone, and any significant losses could lead to a decline towards the $86,500 support level. The primary support level is positioned at $85,000, below which the price may accelerate downward in the near term.

Technical indicators are showing mixed signals. The hourly MACD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone, suggesting some potential for upward movement. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for BTC/USD is above the 50 level, indicating that bullish momentum could be building. 

## From author
Bitcoin continues to navigate a challenging market landscape characterized by volatility and shifting investor sentiment. The recent price action highlights the ongoing struggle between bullish and bearish forces within the market. Observing the resistance and support levels will be critical for traders and investors as they strategize for the upcoming days.

## Impact on the crypto market
- Bitcoin's struggle to maintain levels above $90,000 could influence market sentiment, potentially leading to increased volatility.
- Resistance levels at $90,500 and $92,000 will be pivotal in determining whether bullish momentum can sustain itself.
- The presence of significant support levels may provide a safety net for Bitcoin, but failure to hold these levels could trigger a broader market decline.
- The current price action could affect trader confidence and decision-making, impacting trading volumes and market engagement.
- Overall, Bitcoin's price movements will continue to serve as a bellwether for broader cryptocurrency market trends.
