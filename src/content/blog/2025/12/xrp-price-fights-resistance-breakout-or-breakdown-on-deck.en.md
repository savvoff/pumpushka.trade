## Overview

XRP is currently experiencing a decline as it struggles to maintain its value below the $2.050 mark. The price has faced significant resistance near the $2.040 level, and technical indicators suggest a precarious situation for the cryptocurrency. This scenario raises concerns about potential further declines if key support levels are breached.

## XRP Price Movement

XRP's recent price action has shown a clear downward trend. After attempting a recovery above the $2.150 level, XRP failed to sustain its momentum and subsequently fell below the $2.080 and $2.050 thresholds. The cryptocurrency is now trading beneath the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, indicating bearish sentiment in the market. 

The price has formed a low at $1.993, which marked a critical point in its decline. An attempted upside correction brought the price above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of its recent downward move; however, resistance remains strong. The bears are actively defending the $2.040 and $2.050 levels, creating a bearish trend line on the hourly chart that further complicates any upward movement.

If XRP settles below the $2.00 support level, it could signal a continuation of the downtrend. The immediate support lies near $2.00, with further major support identified at the $1.9880 level. A closure below this level could expose XRP to declines toward $1.920 and potentially lower, with additional support near the $1.880 zone.

## Technical Indicators

The technical indicators for XRP provide further insight into its current state. The hourly MACD is losing momentum within the bearish zone, suggesting that selling pressure may be easing but remains significant. The hourly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above the 50 level, indicating that the selling pressure may not yet be exhausted, but it also suggests that some buying interest is present.

### Resistance and Support Levels

- **Major Resistance Levels**: 
  - $2.040
  - $2.080
  
- **Major Support Levels**: 
  - $2.00
  - $1.9880

## From author

The current struggle of XRP's price highlights the challenges faced by cryptocurrencies in maintaining upward momentum. While the recent attempts to recover above previous highs have failed, the market remains sensitive to shifts in investor sentiment. The resistance at $2.040 and $2.050 will be crucial for determining the next moves for XRP.

## Impact on the crypto market

- XRP's inability to maintain levels above $2.050 may indicate a broader bearish sentiment within the cryptocurrency market.
- The technical indicators suggest that selling pressure remains significant, which could influence trading strategies among investors.
- A breach of key support levels could lead to further declines not only for XRP but potentially for other cryptocurrencies that often move in correlation.
- The ongoing resistance at $2.040 and $2.080 may deter new investors from entering the market, impacting overall trading volume.
- The current price action could prompt analysts and traders to reassess their positions in light of the prevailing bearish trend.
