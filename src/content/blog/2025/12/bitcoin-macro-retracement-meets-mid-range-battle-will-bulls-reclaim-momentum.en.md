## Overview

Bitcoin is currently at a pivotal moment as it navigates a macro retracement while battling within a defined mid-range between two key price zones: $86,000 and $100,000. The market is observing bearish patterns, and the focus is on whether bulls can regain momentum or if a more significant pullback is imminent.

## Bitcoin Confirms Macro Top: Bearish Phase Underway

Recent analysis indicates that Bitcoin has confirmed a market top and is now entering a broader macro retracement phase. The loss of a crucial bullish support level has altered the market structure, pushing it into a bearish phase. A Head and Shoulders formation has been fully realized, aligning with classical technical analysis that suggests a significant downside projection has been achieved. This reinforces the notion that a cycle top is established and a larger trend reversal may be in motion.

The macro Fibonacci retracement analysis, which spans from the bear-market low to the latest peak, highlights several critical levels. The 0.382 retracement level is positioned near $56,700, while the 0.5 level sits around $44,000, marking potential areas for bear-market acceptance. Additionally, the 0.618 retracement, located near $35,000, is identified as the most substantial long-term support area. 

On the liquidity front, there is an unfilled fair value gap between $98,000 and $100,000, which may serve as a magnet for a short-term relief bounce before the prevailing downtrend resumes. Overall, the macro outlook for Bitcoin remains bearish, indicating that while a bounce towards the $98,000–$100,000 region could occur, the primary trajectory appears to lean towards a deeper move into the $70,000–$60,000 Fibonacci support levels.

## BTC Trapped: $96,000–$100,000 Cap Meets $86,000 Support

Bitcoin is currently confined within a range defined by two essential price zones, as highlighted by recent observations. The price hovers around $90,300 after facing repeated rejections from the $96,000–$100,000 supply zone and the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA). This supply zone has consistently limited upward movements over the past weeks.

On the downside, buying pressure has been evident around the $86,000–$88,000 demand zone, which is crucial in preventing Bitcoin from experiencing a more severe breakdown. This support has kept Bitcoin locked within its current trading range. From a broader market perspective, Bitcoin previously saw a relaxation phase while technology stocks experienced gains. As momentum in the tech sector begins to slow, Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize. However, reclaiming the $96,000–$100,000 zone decisively is essential for shifting momentum in favor of the bulls.

If Bitcoin can maintain a sustained move above $100,000, it could pave the way for a trend reversal. Conversely, a breach of the $88,000 support could lead Bitcoin towards a more profound pullback, targeting the $72,000–$76,000 region. Until one of these scenarios materializes, the price action is expected to remain volatile, necessitating a patient approach from traders.
