## Overview

Crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) have experienced a significant rebound, recording inflows of $1.07 billion after a four-week decline. This resurgence coincides with XRP achieving its best weekly performance, driven in part by recent developments in the US ETF landscape.

## What Happened

Crypto ETPs have seen a notable turnaround, attracting over $1 billion in inflows following a period of four consecutive weeks of losses. This influx of capital marks a critical shift in investor sentiment towards these financial products, which offer exposure to digital assets.

Concurrently, XRP has reached record weekly gains. This upward momentum for XRP is particularly relevant in light of the recent launches of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, which have contributed to a more favorable environment for cryptocurrencies.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The influx of $1.07 billion into crypto ETPs suggests a renewed interest from investors.
- XRP's record weekly gains indicate strong market performance and investor confidence.
- The launch of US ETFs is likely influencing broader market trends and investor behavior.
- The rebound in ETP inflows could signal a potential recovery phase for the crypto market.
- Increased institutional interest may pave the way for further growth in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
