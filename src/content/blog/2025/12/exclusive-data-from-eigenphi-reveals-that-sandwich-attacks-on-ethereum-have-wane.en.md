## Overview

Recent data from EigenPhi indicates a decline in sandwich attacks on the Ethereum network. Despite this decrease, it is reported that a significant number of traders continue to be affected by various MEV (Miner Extractable Value) attacks monthly, leading to substantial financial losses.

## What Happened

EigenPhi's exclusive data highlights that sandwich attacks, a specific type of MEV attack, have diminished in frequency. However, the broader category of MEV attacks still impacts hundreds of traders each month. These attacks are known for exploiting vulnerabilities in the trading process, resulting in traders losing millions. The persistence of these attacks underscores ongoing challenges within the Ethereum ecosystem regarding transaction security and trader protection.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The decline in sandwich attacks may indicate improvements in security measures or awareness among traders.
- Continued MEV attacks highlight the vulnerabilities still present in the Ethereum network.
- The financial losses incurred by traders may affect overall confidence in Ethereum as a trading platform.
- The data suggests a need for enhanced protective strategies to safeguard traders against MEV attacks.
- The situation reflects ongoing challenges in ensuring fair trading practices within the crypto market.
