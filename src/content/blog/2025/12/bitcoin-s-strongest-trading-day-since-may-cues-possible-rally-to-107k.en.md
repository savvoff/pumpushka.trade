## Overview

Bitcoin experienced its most significant daily gain since May, driven by increased buy-side flows, a notable shift in investor sentiment, and the re-emergence of the Coinbase premium. These developments suggest a possible rally that could push Bitcoin's value above $100,000.

## What Happened

On a recent trading day, Bitcoin registered its strongest daily performance since May. This uptick in price is attributed to several factors, including a surge in buy-side flows, which indicates heightened demand from investors looking to purchase Bitcoin. Additionally, there was a sharp adjustment in investor sentiment, signaling a more optimistic outlook among market participants. 

Moreover, the return of the Coinbase premium, which reflects the price difference between Bitcoin traded on Coinbase and other exchanges, points to a renewed interest in Bitcoin. These combined elements create a scenario where a rally above the $100,000 mark becomes a possibility.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased buy-side flows indicate growing demand for Bitcoin among investors.
- A shift in investor sentiment may lead to heightened market activity and engagement.
- The return of the Coinbase premium could signal a stronger market position for Bitcoin.
