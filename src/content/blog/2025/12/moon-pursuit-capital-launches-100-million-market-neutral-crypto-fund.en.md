Moreover, the announcement of a global expansion push indicates that Moon Pursuit Capital is not only focused on the domestic market but is also eyeing opportunities in international markets. This strategic move suggests that the firm is preparing to capitalize on the growing global interest in cryptocurrencies and digital assets. By establishing a presence in various regions, the firm aims to attract a diverse range of investors seeking exposure to the crypto market.
