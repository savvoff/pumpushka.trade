## Overview

Strive, led by Vivek Ramaswamy, has issued a warning letter to MSCI regarding its proposal to exclude bitcoin treasury companies from its indexes. This potential move could have significant repercussions for the bitcoin treasury sector and the broader financial industry.

## What Happened

MSCI, a prominent provider of market indexes, is considering a proposal that would result in the exclusion of bitcoin treasury companies from its indexes. This proposal has raised concerns among stakeholders in the bitcoin treasury industry, which is valued at $100 billion. The possible exclusion is particularly alarming for companies engaged in this sector, including those following strategies akin to that of Michael Saylor.

The warning letter from Strive emphasizes the potential negative impact of this exclusion on the industry and highlights the interests of fee-hungry bankers who may be affected by changes in index composition. The proposed move by MSCI could reshape the landscape for bitcoin treasury investments and influence the strategies employed by firms operating in this space.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The exclusion of bitcoin treasury companies from MSCI indexes could diminish the visibility and legitimacy of these companies.
- A significant shift in index composition may lead to a decrease in investment and interest in the bitcoin treasury sector.
- Stakeholders in the $100 billion industry are likely to react strongly to any changes, which could create volatility in the market.
- The warning from Strive indicates a growing tension between traditional financial institutions and the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.
- The situation underscores the importance of index providers in shaping investment trends and strategies within the crypto market.
