## Overview

Bitcoin is currently facing significant challenges as it struggles to reclaim the $90,000 level and tests critical demand around the $86,000 zone. After an extended period of corrective price action, the optimism among bulls is waning, leading to discussions among analysts about a potential transition into a broader bear market.

## Current Market Conditions

Recent developments in the Bitcoin market indicate a shift in sentiment, with many analysts noting a deterioration in market structure. After weeks of attempts to regain higher price levels, Bitcoin remains unable to break through, and momentum appears to have faded. Analysts are increasingly concerned that Bitcoin may be entering a bearish phase rather than merely experiencing a temporary pullback.

Axel Adler's recent analysis highlights that Bitcoin's price action aligns with a clear negative shift in market structure. His findings indicate that a composite Structure Shift signal has decisively moved into negative territory. This signal operates on a scale from -1 to +1, where values below zero suggest a dominant bearish regime. Currently, the signal hovers near -0.5, a level historically associated with sustained downside pressure.

In addition, Bitcoin's price has dropped to the lower boundary of the 21-day Donchian Channel and is currently positioned just above the $85,000 support area. These signals collectively indicate that the market is in a risk-off environment, with heightened downside risks unless there is a significant improvement in market structure.

## Bearish Regime Confirmation

The current position of the Structure Shift composite signal confirms that Bitcoin is firmly established within a bearish structural zone. With the indicator below zero, the market is no longer neutral or transitional but is instead experiencing sustained downside conditions. For any improvement to occur, the composite signal would need to recover decisively above the zero threshold while the price maintains support within the Donchian Channel.

This bearish structure is further supported by Bitcoin’s Bull-Bear market structure index, which examines derivatives dynamics. The latest data indicates that the bullish component has collapsed to just 5%, reflecting a severe lack of constructive long-side momentum. Concurrently, the fast bearish component has moved deeper into negative territory, indicating rising seller pressure primarily driven by the futures market.

This situation highlights a critical imbalance in the market. Short-term momentum is firmly under the control of bears, while spot demand has proven insufficient to absorb the selling pressure coming from derivatives. For the market conditions to improve, a meaningful recovery of the bullish component of the index is necessary to signal renewed buyer participation.

## Price Action and Technical Indicators

Currently, Bitcoin continues to trade under significant downside pressure, hovering around the $86,500 level after failing to reclaim higher resistance zones. The price has decisively broken down below both short- and medium-term moving averages, with Bitcoin trading well beneath its 50-day and 100-day averages, which have now flipped to act as resistance.

A notable technical development is Bitcoin's interaction with the 200-day moving average, which has been tested but remains fragile. The absence of follow-through buying raises concerns about the potential for a prolonged consolidation phase or the risk of another leg lower if demand does not materialize.

Structurally, Bitcoin is in a sequence of lower highs and lower lows since the peak near $125,000. As long as the price remains capped below the $90,000–$95,000 resistance zone, downside risks will continue to loom large.

## From author

The ongoing struggles of Bitcoin to reclaim significant price levels reveal a complex interplay of market dynamics driven by both structural indicators and trading sentiment. The negative signals from various indicators suggest that traders may need to adopt a cautious approach in the coming weeks, as the potential for further downside seems to be the prevailing narrative in the market.
