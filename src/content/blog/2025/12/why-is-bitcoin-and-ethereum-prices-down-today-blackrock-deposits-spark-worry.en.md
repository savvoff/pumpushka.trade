## Overview

Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have experienced a significant decline today, coinciding with a period of extreme fear in the crypto market. This downturn is largely attributed to BlackRock's recent transactions, which have raised concerns about potential sell-offs from the world's largest asset manager.

## Market Reaction to BlackRock's Transactions

The drop in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices follows BlackRock's transfer of 2,257 BTC and 74,973 ETH to Coinbase. This movement suggests that BlackRock may be planning to offload these cryptocurrencies. The timing of these transactions aligns with outflows recorded in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which occurred on December 16. This likely indicates that BlackRock moved these assets to redeem shares for its IBIT and ETHA ETFs, which were sold on that day.

The fluctuations in the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum have been dramatic. Bitcoin initially surged to approximately $90,000 from an intraday low of around $87,000 but quickly retraced below the $87,000 mark within an hour. This volatility has sparked theories of market manipulation. Some analysts have pointed out that BlackRock is not the only entity involved in selling pressure; Binance has also been implicated in these price movements.

## The Role of Binance in Price Volatility

Crypto analyst Kruse noted that Binance engaged in buying for over 30 minutes, which temporarily boosted the price of Bitcoin by about $3,300. However, this was followed by a significant sell-off, resulting in the liquidation of over $106 million in short positions during that time. Following this, Bitcoin experienced another sharp downward movement, leading to the liquidation of approximately $52 million in long positions.

Kruse suggested that these price actions are not random but rather indicative of liquidity hunting. He emphasized that the current volatility is a reflection of how leverage is punished in the crypto market. Another on-chain analyst, known as Tracer, echoed similar sentiments, accusing Binance of manipulating the market by pumping and dumping millions of BTC, which led to approximately $194 million in liquidations of both shorts and longs within just one hour.
