## Overview

Dogecoin is currently facing significant market challenges as it attempts to maintain a critical support level amidst ongoing volatility. Analysts are warning of potential further declines, emphasizing a cautious approach for investors.

## Market Situation

Following a recent market pullback, Dogecoin is striving to hold the crucial support area of approximately $0.120. This level is vital for the cryptocurrency as it could pave the way for a potential recovery rally. However, the sentiment among analysts suggests that the downward trend may not yet be over, with predictions of further declines looming.

On Friday, Dogecoin experienced a 4.2% intraday decline, dropping from the $0.126 range. This decline marks a significant retracement of over 50% from the early October highs, with the cryptocurrency losing several key support zones over the past two months. After breaking below the $0.135 level nearly two weeks ago, Dogecoin has been trading within the $0.120-$0.135 range, struggling to break through the upper limits despite multiple attempts.

Analysts are advising caution as Dogecoin attempts to hold the $0.120 support zone. One analyst noted that Dogecoin is “still a falling knife,” indicating that its corrective phase may not be complete. The lack of evidence for a bottom in the current wave implies that a drop of about 20% toward key support levels of $0.096 and $0.08 could be possible. The recommendation is to remain cautious until a clear upward trend is established.

Another analyst echoed these sentiments, highlighting that Dogecoin does not exhibit a bullish reversal structure and is experiencing weak buying volume compared to other altcoins. The bearish momentum persists, and as long as Dogecoin remains under the $0.14-$0.15 range, the downtrend is expected to continue. Without significant buying pressure, the outlook remains grim, and a further decline toward the $0.100-$0.095 area seems plausible.

Despite these warnings, some market watchers believe that Dogecoin's deep correction may be concluding. One observer pointed out that the cryptocurrency is situated in a major demand zone between $0.120 and $0.130, suggesting that a recovery rally could occur if these levels are reclaimed. Conversely, failing to hold these levels may lead to extended consolidation.

Additionally, observations have been made regarding Dogecoin's price movements relative to a symmetrical triangle pattern. Following a breakdown from this pattern earlier in the month, Dogecoin is now forming another triangle. This new formation could lead to a significant price movement, either bullish or bearish, with a potential 15% shift on the horizon. The recent pullback has already sent Dogecoin below the lower boundary of this pattern, indicating a possible drop to the $0.10-$0.11 range if the price does not bounce back soon.
