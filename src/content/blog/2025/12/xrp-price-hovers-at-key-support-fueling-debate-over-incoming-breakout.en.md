## Overview

XRP price has recently experienced a decline, falling below key support levels. Currently, it is struggling to maintain its position and faces resistance, prompting discussions about potential price movements in the near future.

## Price Movement and Resistance Levels

The XRP price began its latest decline after dropping below $2.10. It is now trading below the $2.050 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A bearish trend line has formed, indicating resistance at the $2.120 mark on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. If the price settles below $2.00, there is potential for further downward movement.

### Recent Attempts at Recovery

Recently, XRP attempted a recovery above the $2.150 level but was unable to maintain its upward momentum, mirroring the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Following this failed recovery, XRP fell below the $2.10 and $2.050 levels. A low was established at $1.984, with the price now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward move from the $2.275 swing high to the $1.984 low.

Currently, XRP is trading below $2.050, and a fresh upward move may face resistance near this level. The first significant resistance point is identified at $2.120, which aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downward move. 

### Potential Future Movements

Should XRP manage to close above the $2.120 resistance, it could lead to a rise toward the $2.20 level. Additional hurdles exist at $2.250 and a clear move above this point may push the price toward $2.2850, with further gains potentially reaching $2.350. The next major resistance for bullish movements is positioned around the $2.40 mark.

### Risks of Further Declines

Conversely, if XRP fails to break through the $2.050 resistance zone, it could initiate a new decline. The initial support level on the downside is around $2.00, followed closely by a major support at $1.9850. A downside break and close below this level may lead to a further decline toward $1.920, with additional support near the $1.880 zone, below which the price could drop further to $1.820.

## Impact on the crypto market

- XRP’s struggle to maintain key support levels may reflect broader market sentiment.
- The formation of a bearish trend line indicates potential challenges for upward price movements.
- Resistance levels at $2.050 and $2.120 could influence trading decisions for investors.
- The ongoing decline below significant support levels may lead to increased volatility in the market.
- XRP's performance could impact the overall perception of altcoins, especially in relation to Bitcoin and Ethereum.
