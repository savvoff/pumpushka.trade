## Overview

Ethereum's price has recently struggled to maintain stability, failing to stay above the $3,000 mark and experiencing further declines. Currently, ETH is consolidating its losses, with the potential for a recovery wave contingent on overcoming specific resistance levels.

## Recent Price Movements

Ethereum's price entered a downward trajectory after failing to sustain above $3,000, which has led to a decline below the $2,950 zone. The cryptocurrency is now trading below the $2,900 threshold, alongside the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A bearish trend line has formed, marking resistance at $2,920 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

The price has dipped significantly, with Ethereum recently falling to new weekly lows. After attempting to rally, ETH encountered difficulties above the $3,000 level, similar to the challenges faced by Bitcoin. The price eventually dropped below key levels, including $2,950 and $2,920, entering a bearish market phase. The decline continued as the bears pushed the price below $2,850, with a low recorded at $2,790.

Currently, Ethereum is consolidating losses well below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward move from a swing high of $3,175 to the recent low of $2,790. Trading below the $2,900 mark and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average indicates a continued bearish sentiment in the market.

If Ethereum can initiate an upward movement, it may encounter resistance near the $2,880 level. The subsequent key resistance level is located near $2,920, coinciding with the bearish trend line. Should the price break above the $2,980 level, it might have the potential to rise toward the $3,030 resistance area. A successful breach of this region could signal further gains in the following days, possibly pushing Ether toward resistance zones of $3,120 or even $3,150.

### Potential for Further Decline

Conversely, if Ethereum fails to surpass the $2,880 resistance, it could trigger another decline. Initial support on the downside is identified near the $2,800 level, with a major support zone at approximately $2,780. A decisive move below this support might lead to a further drop toward the $2,740 level, and continued losses could push the price down to the $2,625 area. The next key support is positioned at $2,550.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for ETH/USD is showing increasing momentum in the bearish zone, indicating a potential continuation of the downward trend.
- **Hourly RSI**: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for ETH/USD is currently below the 50 zone, reinforcing the bearish outlook.

## From author

The current market dynamics for Ethereum underscore the challenges facing the cryptocurrency as it navigates through resistance and support levels. The failure to maintain the $3,000 threshold has catalyzed a series of declines, which may continue unless a decisive recovery is observed.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Ethereum's inability to hold above $3,000 reflects broader market sentiment and could influence investor confidence.
- The establishment of key support and resistance levels may guide trading strategies among market participants.
- Continued bearish momentum could lead to increased volatility as traders react to price movements around established thresholds.
- A potential recovery above critical resistance levels may invigorate buying interest and positively impact Ethereum's market position.
- Overall, Ethereum's price action may serve as a barometer for the performance of other cryptocurrencies within the market.
