## Overview

Recent analysis suggests that XRP may be poised for a significant price rally, with projections indicating a potential surge of 690% to reach $15. This forecast comes from a crypto analyst who believes that XRP is currently experiencing a measured move that could lead to explosive price increases, despite the prevailing bearish trend.

## XRP's Current Market Situation

Crypto market analyst Javon Marks has provided a new outlook on XRP, identifying a continuation setup based on historical price behavior. Marks notes that XRP is undergoing a measured move structure similar to what has occurred in the past, particularly following a breakout in 2017. Historically, such measured moves have led to substantial price surges, and Marks is optimistic that the same technical conditions are reemerging in the current market structure of XRP.

According to Marks, if this measured move plays out as expected, XRP could reach levels above $15, representing a significant increase from its current trading levels, which are below $2. This scenario would mark a considerable milestone for XRP, as it has never entered double-digit price territory before and is presently in a downward trend.

Marks' analysis highlights a long-term symmetrical triangle pattern that has formed following XRP’s previous explosive rally during the 2017-2018 bull cycle. The price action has shown that XRP has historically respected converging trend lines, indicating prolonged accumulation and compression over several years. A breakout above the upper boundary of this formation occurred in late 2024, similar to the breakout seen in the previous cycle, which was followed by a strong price rally into early 2025, where XRP surpassed the $3 mark.

Despite these bullish indicators, the current situation is complicated by a notable downtrend. XRP has recently declined, trading at $1.87 after experiencing a 15% drop over the past month. This decline raises concerns about the cryptocurrency's immediate recovery potential.

## Analysis of Downtrend Pressure

While some analysts, like Javon Marks, maintain a bullish outlook, others, such as Marcus Cornivus, emphasize the ongoing downtrend of XRP. Cornivus points out that XRP is currently under significant selling pressure, showing no immediate signs of recovery. He mentions that XRP is holding just above a critical demand zone, where a short-term bounce could occur as buyers attempt to defend this area.

However, Cornivus warns that the overall trend remains bearish, with lower highs evident and a descending trendline controlling price action. He indicates that any bounce that fails to break above and hold the trendline will likely result in only a temporary pullback. Furthermore, he cautions that if the demand zone fails, XRP's downside momentum may accelerate, leading to further declines.

## From author

The contrasting views on XRP's price trajectory illustrate the uncertainty that often characterizes the cryptocurrency market. While historical patterns may suggest potential for recovery, the prevailing bearish sentiment cannot be ignored. Investors should remain cautious and aware of the market dynamics as they unfold.

## Impact on the crypto market

- A potential surge in XRP's price could influence overall market sentiment and lead to increased interest in altcoins.
- If XRP successfully breaks out of its current downtrend, it may attract new investors and traders looking for opportunities.
- The historical patterns identified by analysts could set a precedent for other cryptocurrencies that exhibit similar price behaviors.
- A significant price increase in XRP could lead to discussions about regulatory implications and market stability, particularly as it approaches uncharted price levels.
- The contrasting analyses highlight the volatility and unpredictability of the crypto market, underscoring the necessity for thorough research and risk management by investors.
