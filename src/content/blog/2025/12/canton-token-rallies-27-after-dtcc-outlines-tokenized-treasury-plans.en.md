## Overview

The recent announcement by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) regarding its plans to bring U.S. Treasurys onto the blockchain has sparked a significant reaction in the crypto market. Following this announcement, the Canton token experienced a notable rally, increasing by 27%. This development underscores the increasing institutional interest in tokenized real-world assets.
