## Overview

Some of the largest banks are collaborating with Coinbase Global Inc. on pilot projects focused on stablecoins, custody, and trading. This development was shared by the cryptocurrency exchange's chief executive officer on Wednesday.

## What Happened

By working on these pilot projects, banks are likely aiming to better understand the functionalities and implications of stablecoins and cryptocurrency trading in their operations. This move could pave the way for broader adoption of digital currencies within mainstream finance.

## Impact on the crypto market
