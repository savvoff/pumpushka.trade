## Overview

The Bitcoin Policy Institute, along with notable figures in the Bitcoin community, is advocating for a pardon for the developers of Samourai Wallet. This comes as a petition supporting their cause has gained significant traction, surpassing 3,200 signatures.

## What Happened

The call for a pardon stems from the conviction of the Samourai Wallet developers on charges related to being an "unlicensed money transmitter." The Bitcoin Policy Institute argues that this legal action poses a threat to non-custodial code, which is fundamental to the principles of decentralized finance. The situation has raised concerns about the implications of criminalizing developers who create software that enables users to maintain control over their own funds.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased attention on the legal challenges faced by cryptocurrency developers.
- Potential implications for the development of non-custodial financial applications.
- Heightened awareness of the intersection between technology and regulation in the crypto space.
- Influence on public perception regarding the legality of decentralized finance tools.
- Possible shifts in policy discussions related to cryptocurrency regulations.
