## Overview

Meta is reportedly planning to reduce its budget for the Metaverse by 30%, as it reassesses its investments in virtual reality. This decision follows challenges faced by its Horizon Worlds and Quest platforms, leading to potential layoffs.

## What Happened

According to sources familiar with the situation, Meta's strategy is shifting as the company pulls back from its significant financial commitment to virtual reality, which has amounted to $70 billion. The budget cut highlights a change in focus for Meta, particularly concerning its Horizon Worlds and Quest initiatives. This retreat from a previously aggressive investment strategy suggests that Meta is recalibrating its approach to the Metaverse in light of current challenges.

## Impact on the crypto market

- A significant budget cut from a major tech company like Meta may influence investor sentiment regarding virtual reality and related technologies.
- Potential layoffs in Meta's Metaverse divisions could signal a broader trend affecting employment in the tech and virtual reality sectors.
- The shift in Meta's strategy could lead to reduced competition in the Metaverse space, impacting innovation and development in related crypto projects.
- Investors and stakeholders may reassess the viability of virtual reality projects and their integration with blockchain technology.
- The decision could prompt other companies to evaluate their own investments in virtual reality and the Metaverse.
