## Overview

US prosecutors are advocating for a 12-year prison sentence for Do Kwon, the founder of Terraform Labs, in relation to a significant crypto fraud case. This comes in light of the substantial financial losses attributed to the collapse of his project.

## Details of the Case

Prosecutors have highlighted that the fallout from Kwon's Terraform project resulted in losses that exceeded those incurred by other high-profile cases in the cryptocurrency sector, including those of FTX, Celsius, and OneCoin combined. This comparison underscores the scale and impact of the failures associated with Terraform Labs.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The case reflects the increasing scrutiny and regulatory focus on crypto projects and their founders.
- It highlights the potential consequences of mismanagement and fraudulent activities within the cryptocurrency industry.
- The significant losses attributed to the collapse may lead to greater investor caution in the crypto market.
- This situation may influence future regulatory measures aimed at protecting investors in cryptocurrency ventures.
- The case could set a precedent for how similar cases are handled in the future, potentially affecting the operations of other crypto projects.
