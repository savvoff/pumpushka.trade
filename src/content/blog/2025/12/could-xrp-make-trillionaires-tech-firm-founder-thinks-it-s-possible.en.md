## Overview

Recent discussions led by Joshua Dalton, the founder of Triblu, have sparked interest in the potential for XRP holders to achieve immense wealth if XRP were to be incorporated into a US strategic crypto reserve. Dalton argues that XRP's connections to a US-based company make it a more suitable candidate for such a reserve compared to Bitcoin, which faces scrutiny due to its anonymous creator.

## The Proposal and Its Implications

Dalton's assertions are based on the current financial landscape, particularly the US national debt, which is reportedly around $38 trillion. He highlights that Ripple's escrow holds approximately 34.4 billion XRP. According to Dalton's calculations, for XRP to offset a significant portion of the national debt—about 80%—the price of XRP would need to reach close to $883. This projection has generated excitement within segments of the crypto community, as it suggests that XRP could play a crucial role in national fiscal strategy.

At present, XRP is trading at around $1.91, which implies a theoretical increase of over 46,000% to reach the projected price. In comparison, Bitcoin's current market position would necessitate it reaching about $30 million per coin to fulfill similar debt-offset criteria, based on a hypothetical focus on 1 million BTC. This would translate to a gain of over 33,000% from current levels.

## Legal and Market Challenges

Despite the enthusiasm surrounding Dalton's proposal, significant legal and market challenges remain. Earlier this year, an executive order was signed, establishing a framework for a national Bitcoin reserve. However, Bitcoin remains the primary focus, with other cryptocurrencies often categorized as seizure assets rather than integral components of the reserve strategy.

A notable obstacle is the nature of Ripple's escrow, which is privately controlled and governed by contracts. This means that any attempt by the government to commandeer XRP would likely lead to extended legal battles. Moreover, if the government were to acquire large quantities of XRP, the act of liquidating those assets could severely disrupt the market, leading to a decline in XRP's price rather than an increase.

## Holder Scenarios and Market Dynamics

Analyzing wallet data reveals that some XRP holders could experience substantial nominal gains if the price were to reach $880. For instance, an individual holding 10,000 XRP, currently valued at approximately $19,100, could see their investment soar to nearly $9 million. There are 179,546 wallets that contain between 5,000 and 10,000 XRP, and 2,006 addresses hold between 500,000 and 1 million XRP. Most of the largest XRP reserves are concentrated within Ripple, its founders, or exchanges, with only 20 wallets holding between 500 million and 1 billion XRP.

## From author

The enthusiasm surrounding XRP's potential to alleviate national debt reflects broader aspirations within the crypto community for recognition and integration into traditional financial systems. However, the complexities of legal frameworks and market dynamics present significant barriers that must be addressed for any such scenario to materialize.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The discussion around XRP's potential use in a US strategic crypto reserve could increase interest and investment in XRP.
- Legal challenges associated with Ripple's escrow may deter institutional adoption of XRP.
- The speculative nature of price predictions could lead to market volatility and investor uncertainty.
- Comparisons between XRP and Bitcoin in terms of their suitability for national reserves may influence the broader crypto narrative.
- The focus on 2026 as a pivotal year for XRP may attract speculative trading and heightened media attention.
