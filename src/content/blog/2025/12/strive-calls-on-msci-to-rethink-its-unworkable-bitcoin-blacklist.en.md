## Overview

Strive's CEO, Matt Cole, has made a call to MSCI, urging the organization to reconsider its stance on Bitcoin-holding companies. He advocates for allowing the market to determine the inclusion of such companies in passive investments.

## What Happened

Matt Cole, the CEO of Strive, has expressed concerns regarding MSCI's current policies related to Bitcoin. He argues that the existing blacklist of companies holding Bitcoin is "unworkable." Cole believes that the decision to include or exclude Bitcoin-holding companies should rest in the hands of the market, rather than being dictated by MSCI's guidelines.

## Importance of the Situation

Cole's appeal to MSCI highlights the ongoing debate surrounding Bitcoin and its role in investment strategies. His statements emphasize the growing influence of cryptocurrencies in the financial landscape and the need for investment firms to adapt to market preferences.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased scrutiny on MSCI's policies regarding cryptocurrency investments.
- Potential for changes in how Bitcoin-holding companies are viewed by institutional investors.
- Reflection of broader market sentiments towards Bitcoin and its legitimacy as an investment asset.
- Encouragement for other firms to reconsider their positions on cryptocurrency inclusion in investment portfolios.
- Possible shifts in passive investment strategies as market demand evolves.
