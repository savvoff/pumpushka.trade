## Overview

Bitcoin has recently shown signs of strength, initiating an upward movement above the $90,500 mark. As it consolidates gains, the cryptocurrency may be poised to challenge the $91,650 resistance level. This development is significant as it reflects renewed bullish momentum in the market.

## Recent Price Movements

Bitcoin's price began a notable increase, breaking above the $90,500 zone. Currently, it is trading above $91,000 and the 100 hourly Simple Moving Average. The movement above a key bearish trend line at the $90,000 resistance on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair indicates a potential shift in market sentiment.

The price has also managed to stay above the $90,500 zone, which is crucial for sustaining bullish momentum. Following this, Bitcoin achieved notable gains, surpassing levels of $91,500 and $92,500, and even breaking above the $93,000 resistance. A peak was established at $94,050, although the price experienced a correction afterward.

During this correction, Bitcoin fell below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the upward move from a previous swing low to the established high. However, buyer interest was observed near the $87,800 support level, coinciding with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the same upward movement. As a result, Bitcoin is again rising above $90,000, supported by the bullish activity.

The immediate resistance level is identified near $91,650, with further key resistances at $92,000 and $93,000. A sustained close above the $93,000 resistance could potentially lead to further price increases, with targets such as $95,000 and even $95,500 being discussed. Above these levels, the next barriers for bulls are positioned at $96,200 and $96,450.

## Potential Declines

Conversely, if Bitcoin does not manage to break above the $91,650 resistance zone, it could face another decline. The immediate support level is around $90,000, followed by a significant support level at $89,500. Should the price continue to drop, the next support area is near $87,800. Further losses could lead the price down to around $87,250 in the near term, with the main support level identified at $86,500. Falling below this point might lead to accelerated declines.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD is showing positive momentum in the bullish zone.
- **Hourly RSI**: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for BTC/USD is positioned above the neutral 50 level, suggesting bullish sentiment.
