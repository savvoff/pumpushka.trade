## Overview

Crypto analyst Dark Defender remains optimistic about XRP, asserting that the cryptocurrency is not in a bear market despite its current downtrend. The analyst's position centers on the belief that XRP is experiencing a temporary phase within a larger bullish trend, suggesting a potential for significant price increases in the future.

## Current Market Analysis

Dark Defender, a prominent supporter of XRP, has articulated that the current decline in XRP's price is not indicative of a bear market. Instead, it is attributed to the cryptocurrency entering Wave 4 of the Elliott Wave theory. This wave is traditionally seen as a bearish phase, which explains the rapid decrease in XRP's price. However, Dark Defender clarifies that this Wave 4 has been in effect since February 2025, meaning it has been ongoing for some time and needs to complete its cycle before the subsequent wave can commence.

According to this analysis, the final wave of the Elliott Wave theory is anticipated to be the most bullish. Dark Defender encourages XRP investors to remain calm and patient, as the current price movements align with the expected pattern. The target price suggested by the analyst is notably higher than the previous all-time high, indicating a potential upward trajectory.

In addition to Dark Defender's insights, another analyst known as STEPH IS CRYPTO supports the notion that XRP is not in a bear market. This analyst highlights a bullish divergence in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart for XRP. This occurrence is rare and has historically preceded significant price increases, as seen in 2022 when a similar pattern led to a rapid price rise after distribution.

The identification of a bullish divergence suggests that selling pressure may be diminishing, indicating a possible bottoming out of the price. While there are no specific targets mentioned for XRP's future price, the emergence of this technical signal implies that a rally could be forthcoming.
