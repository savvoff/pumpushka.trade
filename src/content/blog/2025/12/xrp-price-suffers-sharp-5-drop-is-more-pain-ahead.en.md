## XRP Price Suffers Sharp 5% Drop—Is More Pain Ahead?

XRP has experienced a significant decline, dropping below the $1.950 threshold and currently facing resistance around the $1.920 level. This downturn raises concerns about the potential for further declines in the cryptocurrency's value.

## Current Price Movement

XRP price has started a fresh decline, trading below the $1.90 mark and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The price action indicates a bearish trend, as evidenced by the formation of a bearish trend line with resistance at $1.980 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. This trend is notable as XRP previously attempted a recovery above $2.020 but failed to gain momentum, mirroring the struggles seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The recent price movements show that XRP has not only dropped below the key psychological barrier of $2.00 but has also broken through the $1.950 and $1.920 support levels. A low was established at $1.8550, with the price currently exhibiting bearish signs below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward movement from a swing high to the established low. The ongoing struggle to maintain levels above $1.90 highlights the challenges XRP faces in reversing its current trajectory.

If XRP manages to initiate an upward move, it is likely to encounter resistance near the $1.90 level, with the first major resistance positioned at $1.920. A close above this level could potentially push the price toward $1.950 or the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent decline. However, the trend line at $1.980 represents another significant hurdle that needs to be surpassed for any substantial recovery.

## From author

The current bearish trend in XRP's price raises essential questions about the future direction of the cryptocurrency. The inability to maintain prices above critical support levels indicates a lack of buying interest and could signal more challenges ahead. The technical indicators, including the MACD gaining pace in the bearish zone and the RSI falling below the 50 level, further corroborate the prevailing negative sentiment in the market.

As XRP continues to grapple with resistance levels and the potential for further declines, traders and investors must closely monitor these technical signals. The formation of key support levels will be critical in determining whether XRP can stabilize or if it will succumb to further downward pressure.

## Impact on the crypto market

- XRP's drop below significant resistance levels may influence overall market sentiment toward altcoins.
- The failure to recover above $2.00 could lead to increased caution among investors and traders.
- The bearish trend in XRP may have a ripple effect, impacting trading volumes and interest in related cryptocurrencies.
- Technical indicators suggest a prevailing bearish outlook, which could deter new investments in XRP and similar assets.
- Continued declines in XRP may prompt discussions about broader market trends and investor confidence in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
