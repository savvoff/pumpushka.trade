## Overview

A recent report by CoinGecko has identified the Real-World Asset (RWA) sector as the leading narrative in the cryptocurrency market for 2025, showcasing significant growth and returns. This emerging sector has not only outperformed others but has also highlighted the potential of integrating tangible assets into the digital landscape.

## RWA Sector Emerges Strong

According to the CoinGecko report, the RWA sector has gained substantial traction in 2025, achieving an impressive average price return of 185.8% year-to-date (YTD) across key tokens. Some of the notable tokens contributing to this growth include Figure Heloc, Chainlink, Stellar, Tether Gold, and BlackRock’s BUIDL. This remarkable surge in the RWA sector is primarily attributed to the performance of specific platforms.

Among these platforms, Keeta Network has experienced a staggering increase of 1,794.9% YTD. Other platforms like Zebec Network and Maple Finance have also shown significant gains, with increases of 217.3% and 123.0%, respectively. These figures underscore the growing interest and investment in RWAs, which are redefining how tangible assets are traded and managed in the crypto space.

Despite the positive growth in the RWA sector, the report also indicates some mixed results in related asset values. The Distributed Asset Value within the crypto RWA sector stands at $18.88 billion, reflecting a 2.56% increase over the past month. In contrast, the Represented Asset Value has seen a slight decline, currently at $407.93 billion, down by 2.36%. This disparity suggests that while the RWA sector is expanding, there are challenges in maintaining the overall valuation of represented assets.

## Other Crypto Narratives

In addition to RWAs, the report highlights Layer-1 (L1) solutions as the second most profitable narrative in 2025, achieving an average price gain of 80.3% YTD. This success can be linked to the performance of privacy-focused blockchains such as Zcash and Monero, which have experienced significant rallies of 691.3% and 143.6%, respectively.

Another notable narrative is the “Made in USA” category, which is also showing positive trends, with average gains of 30.6% YTD. This growth has been primarily driven by Zcash’s performance, which has helped offset the losses of other tokens in this category.

Conversely, the report reveals that the meme token and artificial intelligence (AI) narratives have faced considerable challenges this year. Memecoins have recorded average returns of -31.6%, with leading tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu suffering significant losses exceeding 60% YTD. Similarly, AI-focused crypto assets have seen declines ranging from 49.8% to 84.3%, with only a few tokens performing relatively better.

The decentralized finance (DeFi) narrative has also struggled, experiencing average returns of -34.8% YTD. This decline is mirrored in the decentralized exchange (DEX) sector, which has recorded average losses of -55.5%, while layer-2 (L2) solutions have faced a challenging year with average returns of -40.6% for the second consecutive year.
