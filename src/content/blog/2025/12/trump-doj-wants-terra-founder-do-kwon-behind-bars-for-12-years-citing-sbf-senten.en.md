## Overview

Federal prosecutors are advocating for a prison sentence of up to 12 years for Do Kwon, the founder of Terra. This request follows an August plea deal where prosecutors reserved the right to pursue this maximum sentence.

## What Happened

In recent developments, the prosecution has decided to seek the maximum sentence for Do Kwon, who is facing legal challenges related to his role in the Terra project. The plea deal established in August allowed for this possibility, indicating that the prosecutors believe this length of imprisonment is warranted in light of the circumstances surrounding Kwon's actions.

## Why It Matters

The prosecution's push for a 12-year sentence highlights the serious legal implications for individuals involved in significant cryptocurrency projects. It underscores the increasing scrutiny and regulatory pressures facing founders and executives in the crypto space, especially following high-profile cases in the industry.

## Impact on the crypto market
