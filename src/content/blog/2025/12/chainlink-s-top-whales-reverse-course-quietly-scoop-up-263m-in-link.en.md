## Overview

Recent on-chain data indicates that the top 100 whales on the Chainlink network have resumed accumulating the LINK asset, reversing their earlier trend of distribution. This significant shift in behavior has been observed since the start of November, where these large holders collectively acquired a substantial amount of tokens.

## Accumulation of Chainlink by Whales

On-chain analytics firm Santiment has highlighted a noteworthy trend in the holdings of the largest Chainlink addresses, defined as the top 100 wallets on the network. These wallets represent significant stakeholders in the Chainlink ecosystem, and their trading behavior is often seen as a barometer for market sentiment.

According to Santiment’s analysis, the combined supply of Chainlink held by these top addresses experienced a decline in October. This decrease coincided with a sharp price drop for LINK, which prompted these large entities to sell off portions of their holdings. The selling trend persisted until early November, when the supply metric reached a bottom.

Following this period of distribution, the trend shifted in favor of accumulation. Since the start of November, the top Chainlink addresses have collectively added approximately 20.46 million tokens to their holdings, valued at around $263 million. This increase not only recouped the losses incurred during October but also elevated their total supply to a new high.

While the overall trend has been one of accumulation, the pace of buying among these whales has not been uniform. Data suggests that most of the accumulation took place in November, with minimal activity observed in December thus far. The future behavior of these top investors remains uncertain, and their actions could signal potential movements in the price of LINK.

## Technical Analysis and Market Sentiment

In addition to the accumulation trend, Chainlink has recently experienced a technical setback. Analyst Ali Martinez noted that the cryptocurrency lost a multi-year technical support line, which had previously held firm during earlier price corrections. The breakdown below this support line marks the first such occurrence since 2023. 

After this drop, LINK made an attempt to reclaim the support level; however, the effort was met with rejection, suggesting a potential shift where the former support may now act as resistance. This development adds another layer of complexity to the current market sentiment surrounding Chainlink.

## From author

The recent accumulation by Chainlink's top whales presents an intriguing dynamic in the cryptocurrency's market. While the increase in holdings may indicate confidence among these significant investors, the loss of a crucial support level raises questions about the asset's price trajectory. The contrasting signals from whale behavior and technical indicators create a nuanced picture that investors should carefully monitor.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The return of accumulation by top Chainlink whales may bolster market confidence in LINK.
- The significant amount of tokens added could influence future price movements if buying continues.
- The loss of a multi-year support line could lead to increased volatility in Chainlink’s price.
- The contrasting trends of accumulation and technical resistance may create uncertainty for smaller investors.
- Overall market sentiment could be affected as traders analyze the implications of whale activity and technical breakdowns.
