## Overview

Solana has recently faced challenges in maintaining its price levels, leading to a notable correction. Following a failure to exceed a significant price threshold, Solana's price has dipped below critical support levels, prompting caution among traders.

## Price Correction and Current Status

The price of Solana (SOL) struggled to remain above $126 and has since corrected its gains. Currently, SOL is trading below $125 and may find support around the $120 level. This downward movement follows a broader trend affecting major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price entered a bearish zone after dipping below both $126 and $125, indicating a shift in market sentiment.

A bearish trend line has formed with resistance at $124 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. This trend line suggests that the price may continue to face challenges in recovering. Despite this, there remains some buying interest near the $122 mark, indicating that bulls are still active in the market. However, the current trading position is below the 100-hourly simple moving average, which is a critical indicator for short-term price movements.

On the upside, Solana's price encounters resistance at the $125 level and the aforementioned trend line. The next significant resistance level is identified at $128, with a crucial threshold at $130. A close above this $130 resistance could potentially lead to a more sustained upward trend, with further resistance levels at $135 and $142.

## Potential for Further Declines

If Solana cannot break through the $125 resistance, there is a risk of further declines. Initial support is observed near the $122 level, with the first major support located around $120. This level also coincides with the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement of the upward movement from the $117 swing low to the $127 high. A breach below the $120 level might trigger a decline toward the $112 support zone, and a close below this level could lead to further losses, potentially reaching the $105 support in the near term.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining momentum within the bearish zone, suggesting increasing selling pressure.
- **Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: The RSI for SOL/USD is currently below the 50 level, indicating a bearish trend.

### Major Support and Resistance Levels

- **Support Levels**: $122, $120
- **Resistance Levels**: $125, $128
