## Overview

TIX is working on a decentralized finance (DeFi) solution designed to enhance the ticketing system for live events. The initiative focuses on utilizing onchain tickets to facilitate venue financing and streamline payout processes. This approach could potentially address shortcomings in traditional ticketing systems, particularly those associated with established platforms.

## What Happened

TIX is in the process of developing a settlement layer that leverages DeFi principles for live events. The core of this innovation lies in the use of onchain tickets. By transitioning ticket sales to a blockchain-based system, TIX aims to create a more transparent and efficient marketplace for live events. 

The introduction of onchain tickets has the potential to unlock new financing opportunities for venues. This is particularly significant in an industry where upfront costs can be substantial. By using blockchain technology, TIX aims to provide a reliable mechanism for financing that can benefit both event organizers and venue operators.

Additionally, the DeFi-based settlement layer is designed to simplify the payout process for artists and event organizers. Traditional ticketing platforms often involve complex arrangements for profit sharing and payouts, which can lead to delays and disputes. The use of onchain tickets could streamline these processes, ensuring that funds are distributed more efficiently and transparently.

This development is noteworthy as it represents a shift towards integrating blockchain technology into sectors that have historically been dominated by a few major players. The traditional ticketing industry has faced criticism for high fees, lack of transparency, and issues related to fraud. By offering a decentralized alternative, TIX could provide a solution that addresses these common pain points.

## From author

The emergence of TIX's DeFi-based ticketing system illustrates a growing trend in the integration of blockchain technology into various industries. As consumer preferences shift towards more transparent and efficient solutions, the potential for onchain tickets to disrupt the traditional ticketing landscape becomes increasingly relevant. This innovation not only presents a new way to handle ticket sales but also raises questions about the future of event financing and artist compensation in a rapidly evolving digital ecosystem.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The development of onchain ticketing systems could drive increased adoption of blockchain technology in the entertainment sector.
- A successful implementation of TIX's model may encourage other industries to explore DeFi solutions for their operational challenges.
- The shift towards onchain tickets could lead to greater transparency and efficiency in ticket sales, potentially reducing fraud and increasing consumer trust.
- This innovation may attract investment into DeFi projects focused on real-world applications, enhancing the overall growth of the crypto market.
- The potential for improved financing options for venues might stimulate more live events, contributing to a vibrant entertainment industry.
- If TIX's system proves effective, it could prompt regulatory discussions surrounding the use of blockchain technology in traditional industries.
