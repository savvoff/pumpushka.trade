## Overview

Tools for Humanity has made significant strides in enhancing its World app, introducing several new features aimed at creating a super-app model. This expansion includes the rollout of World Chat, which offers end-to-end encryption, alongside new functionalities such as DeFi-powered yield through Morpho and QR-code payments accepted by over one million merchants in Argentina.

## New Features in the World App

The latest update to the World app from Tools for Humanity brings forth notable advancements, particularly with the introduction of World Chat. This feature is designed to provide users with a secure messaging platform, utilizing end-to-end encryption to ensure that conversations remain private and protected. The focus on privacy through encryption underscores a growing trend in digital communication, where users are increasingly prioritizing security.

In addition to World Chat, the app now incorporates DeFi-powered yield capabilities via Morpho. This integration allows users to earn yield on their assets through decentralized finance mechanisms, enhancing the app's appeal to those interested in maximizing their financial opportunities. This feature represents a significant step toward bridging traditional finance with decentralized finance, making it easier for users to engage with both sectors.

Moreover, the World app has expanded its payment functionalities by enabling QR-code payments. This development is particularly impactful in Argentina, where over one million merchants are now set up to accept payments through the app. The ability to make quick and convenient payments via QR codes aligns with the growing trend of digital payments and mobile wallets, making financial transactions more accessible for users.
