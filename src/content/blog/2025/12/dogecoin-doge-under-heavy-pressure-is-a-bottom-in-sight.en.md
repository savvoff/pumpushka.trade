## Overview

Dogecoin has recently experienced a significant decline, falling below critical support levels against the US Dollar. This movement is accompanied by bearish signs, prompting concerns about the cryptocurrency's future performance and potential recovery.

## Recent Price Movements

Dogecoin's price began to decline after it closed below a pivotal level. Following this, it dropped beneath the $0.1320 mark, which has been identified as a key threshold. The price is currently trading below $0.1300 and is under the 100-hourly simple moving average. A bearish trend line is forming, indicating resistance at $0.1340 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair, which suggests that the cryptocurrency may face challenges if it attempts to recover.

The decline was marked by Dogecoin falling below the $0.1350 and $0.1340 support levels, eventually reaching a low near $0.1266. This downward movement has left the price consolidating below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of its previous decline from a swing high to the low. 

If Dogecoin experiences a recovery, immediate resistance is anticipated around the $0.1325 level, with further significant resistance near $0.1340. The next major resistance point is noted at around $0.1400, which corresponds to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the earlier downward move. A close above this level could potentially lead to further upward movement towards the $0.1450 and $0.1500 levels. 

## Potential for Further Declines

Should Dogecoin fail to surpass the $0.1350 threshold, it risks extending its downward trajectory. Initial support on the downside is identified near the $0.1280 level, with subsequent significant support at $0.1250. The primary support level is situated at $0.120. A breach of this main support could trigger further declines, possibly leading Dogecoin towards the $0.1050 level or even down to $0.10 in the near term.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for DOGE/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone, indicating a strengthening downward trend.
- **Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: The RSI for DOGE/USD is currently above the 50 level, suggesting some underlying strength despite the overall bearish sentiment.

## From author

The current state of Dogecoin reflects broader market trends, as it has fallen in tandem with other cryptocurrencies. The consolidation below key support levels raises questions about the potential for recovery. Observing how the price interacts with these critical levels will be essential for understanding the future direction of Dogecoin.

## Impact on the crypto market
