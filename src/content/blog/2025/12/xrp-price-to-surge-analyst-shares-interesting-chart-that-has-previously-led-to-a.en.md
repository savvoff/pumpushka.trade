## Overview

Crypto analyst Steph has pointed to a notable chart indicating a potential upside for XRP prices. This analysis suggests that XRP may be forming a bottom, which could lead to a significant price rally. The insights shared by Steph highlight key technical indicators and the current market dynamics surrounding XRP.

## Analysis of the Chart

In a recent post on X, Steph emphasized the significance of the 3-week XRP price chart. He noted that the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached a level of 0.00, a rare occurrence that has only been seen once before during the 2022 bear market bottom. This observation is crucial as it signifies that the selling pressure on XRP has been fully exhausted, which is viewed positively for its future price movement.

Steph elaborated that such a low RSI on a high timeframe indicates that momentum to the downside has diminished. However, he cautioned that this does not guarantee an immediate price reversal. The last time the RSI reached this level, XRP entered a prolonged accumulation phase before experiencing a significant upward movement. This pattern suggests that the downside risk for XRP is limited, with long-term holders absorbing supply rather than selling off their holdings.

Additionally, the inflow of capital into XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has been a positive factor for the price of XRP. These funds have seen continuous daily inflows since the launch of the Canary’s fund on November 13, accumulating over $1.1 billion in net assets. This trend indicates a strong demand for XRP, particularly among institutional investors.

## Current Market Conditions

Despite the positive signals from the RSI and ETF inflows, XRP currently remains below critical price levels. Analyst CryptoXLarge pointed out that on the weekly chart, XRP is trading beneath a descending trendline in the 8 to 21 exponential moving average (EMA) range. This week, the price is attempting to break below a key support zone around $1.95, which corresponds with the Fibonacci 0.5 level and the 89-week EMA, a support level that has been resilient throughout the year.

A weekly close below $1.95 could heighten the likelihood of a decline toward the $1.60 support level, which aligns with the Fibonacci 0.618 level. Conversely, a weekly close above $1.95 may enhance buying interest, potentially leading to a relief rally towards higher price targets.

Other analysts, such as Crypto King, have echoed similar sentiments, highlighting that reclaiming the $1.98 level could propel XRP towards higher price levels, although no specific price targets are provided.

## From author

The current analysis of XRP's market conditions and technical indicators reveals a complex landscape. While there are signals suggesting a potential bottom formation and reduced selling pressure, the ongoing price action indicates that XRP is still navigating critical support and resistance levels. The interplay between institutional demand and technical indicators will be crucial in determining the next phase for XRP.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The identification of a potential bottom in XRP could bolster investor confidence, leading to increased buying activity.
- Continued inflows into XRP ETFs may signal strong institutional interest, which can positively influence market sentiment.
- The price action around key support levels will be closely watched, as it may set the tone for future market movements.
- Analysts' observations regarding the RSI may lead to increased scrutiny of other cryptocurrencies, potentially affecting their price dynamics.
- Overall, the developments surrounding XRP could have ripple effects throughout the broader crypto market, influencing trading strategies and investor behavior.
