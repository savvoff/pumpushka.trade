## Overview

XRP is currently experiencing a recovery wave, trading above $2.150 and showing positive signs of potential upward movement. The price may surge further if it manages to clear the $2.250 pivot level, indicating a significant moment for the cryptocurrency.

## Current Price Action

XRP price has initiated a recovery above the $2.120 zone and is now trading above $2.150, surpassing the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $2.20 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price has shown support above $2.00, similar to movements seen in other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The price has successfully climbed above $2.050 and $2.10, entering a positive zone. Additionally, XRP has moved above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of its previous downward movement from a swing high to a low. However, it is currently facing resistance near the $2.220 mark, with the potential for further gains if it can settle above $2.250.

## Resistance and Support Levels

As XRP continues to consolidate near the 76.4% Fib retracement level, the first significant resistance is positioned at approximately $2.220. A close above this level could propel the price towards $2.250, with additional hurdles at $2.350 and $2.40. Should XRP manage to surpass the $2.350 resistance, it could aim for the next major hurdle around $2.50.

On the downside, if XRP fails to breach the $2.250 resistance, it may initiate a decline. Initial support is noted near $2.180, followed by $2.150. Should the price drop below the $2.150 level, it might continue to decline towards the $2.10 mark, with further support at $2.050 and $2.00.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for XRP/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.
- **Hourly RSI**: The RSI for XRP/USD is currently above the 50 level, indicating positive momentum.

## Impact on the crypto market

- XRP's recovery above key levels may influence bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market.
- A successful breakout above the $2.250 resistance could lead to increased trading activity and interest in XRP.
- The formation of a contracting triangle may suggest volatility ahead, which could attract traders looking for price movements.
- Resistance and support levels identified may guide traders' strategies in the short term, impacting overall market dynamics.
