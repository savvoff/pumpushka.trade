## Overview

Bitcoin's recent attempts to recover have faltered, leading to a complete erasure of its gains. Currently, the cryptocurrency is facing challenges in maintaining its value above certain critical support levels, which could signal further downside risks.

## Recent Price Movements

Bitcoin's price initially showed promise with a recovery wave that saw it rise above $88,500 and reach a high of $90,298. However, this upward momentum was short-lived as it encountered resistance near the $90,000 mark, prompting a swift reaction from sellers. Following this, Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline, dropping below $89,000 and eventually falling to a low of $86,700.

As of now, Bitcoin is consolidating losses and trading below $88,000, which is also beneath the 100 hourly Simple Moving Average. This price action indicates that Bitcoin may struggle to reclaim its previous highs, particularly with the formation of a declining channel that has established resistance at approximately $87,500.

### Current Technical Levels

The price of Bitcoin is currently situated below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward move from its recent swing high of $90,298 to the low of $86,700. For Bitcoin to initiate a new recovery wave, it must maintain stability above the $86,500 mark. Immediate resistance is identified near the $87,500 level, with additional resistance points at $88,000 and $88,500. If Bitcoin manages to close above the $88,500 resistance, it could pave the way for a potential rise toward the $89,200 level and beyond, potentially testing the $90,000 resistance again.

Conversely, if Bitcoin fails to break through the $88,500 resistance zone, it may be poised for another decline. The immediate support level is around $86,500, with further significant support identified at $86,000 and $85,500. Should the price continue to drop, the next major support could be at $85,000, while the main support level sits at $83,500.

## From author

The current situation for Bitcoin highlights the volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets. The failure to maintain upward momentum after approaching the $90,000 level raises concerns about investor sentiment and market dynamics. Traders closely monitor these price levels, as breaches of support could trigger further selling pressure.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Bitcoin's failure to hold above $90,000 may influence broader market sentiment, leading to increased caution among investors.
- The current consolidation below significant moving averages could deter new investment and contribute to bearish momentum.
- Resistance levels at $87,500, $88,000, and $88,500 will be critical in determining the short-term direction of Bitcoin's price.
- A decline below $86,500 could trigger further sell-offs, impacting other cryptocurrencies in the market.
- The ongoing technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, which may lead to increased volatility in the coming trading sessions.
