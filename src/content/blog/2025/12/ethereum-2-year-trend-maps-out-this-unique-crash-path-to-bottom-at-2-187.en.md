## Overview

Ethereum has experienced a significant decline in its price, dropping below $3,000 and losing approximately 6.8% in value within the last 24 hours. This recent downturn is part of a larger trend that has been observed over the past two years, suggesting a potential bottom at $2,187.

## Recent Price Action

Over the past day, Ethereum's price has weakened, indicating a troubling trend for investors. The cryptocurrency fell below the $3,000 mark, a critical point of support, and has shown a tendency to reclaim this level. However, a more extensive technical analysis reveals that this decline is part of a broader price framework that has been developing over the last two years.

According to a macro analysis provided by a crypto analyst, Ethereum has predominantly traded within a wide horizontal range, punctuated by two notable fakeouts. These occurred—one below resistance earlier in 2025 and another above resistance later in the same year, which led to a peak price of $4,946 in August. Throughout this period, Ethereum's price has consistently respected an upper boundary between $4,000 and $4,100 while also demonstrating regular demand near the lower support level just above $2,100.

This ongoing price behavior has led to the formation of a structure resembling an inverse head and shoulders pattern on a macro scale. However, rather than signaling an immediate upward movement, this pattern illustrates that the price has oscillated between defined trendlines. Mid-range reactions often dictate whether Ethereum will surge toward resistance or slip back toward support.

Currently, Ethereum is trading within the mid-range of this two-year framework. The recent bearish movement can be interpreted as a rotation toward the lower trendline rather than a complete breakdown of the structure.

## Critical Downside Target

The analysis highlights the lower boundary of the range at approximately $2,187, identifying it as a critical downside target. This level has historically acted as a bounce floor during previous downtrends in 2024 and again in July 2025. If Ethereum continues to trade below the mid-range support around $3,000, it could follow a familiar path that leads toward this lower boundary.

At present, Ethereum is trading at $2,928, which places it about 25% away from the identified target of $2,187. Although such a decline would be disappointing for bullish traders, it would not necessarily undermine the overall price structure. Instead, it would complete another cycle within the established range, akin to earlier declines that ultimately transitioned into rally phases.

The outlook from the analyst also suggests that market activity may remain subdued in the near term. With liquidity expected to thin as the year draws to a close, taking directional positions may prove less attractive. This context indicates that the next significant movement in Ethereum's price is likely to occur in January 2026.

## From author

The ongoing analysis of Ethereum's price movements underscores the importance of understanding broader market trends and historical price behavior. The two-year range indicates that while short-term fluctuations can create uncertainty, they are often part of a larger narrative that shapes long-term trajectories. Investors should remain vigilant and grounded in the technical structures that guide these movements.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Ethereum's recent price drop below $3,000 may influence investor sentiment and trading strategies.
- The identified target of $2,187 could act as a psychological level for traders, impacting market dynamics.
- The historical bounce at $2,187 suggests that this level might provide critical support in future downturns.
- The expectation of subdued market activity could lead to decreased volatility in the near term.
- The potential for a significant price movement in January 2026 may affect trading decisions as investors look ahead.
