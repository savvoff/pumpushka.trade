## Overview

Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison following his guilty plea. A federal judge took into account the testimonies from several victims of Terraform Labs before arriving at the decision. This sentencing marks a significant development in the ongoing scrutiny of cryptocurrency projects and their leaders.

## Details of the Sentencing
