## Overview

Solana (SOL) is currently experiencing a critical phase, retesting a key support area that could influence its price trajectory in the coming months. Analysts have expressed concerns about potential bearish patterns emerging in Solana's chart, indicating a possible major correction ahead.

## Current Market Situation

After reaching a three-week high, Solana faced a notable correction, dropping approximately 6.1% to the $122 area. This decline followed a breach below its macro support around the $120 zone, with the cryptocurrency hitting an eight-month low of $116 in mid-December. Since then, Solana has been fluctuating between the $120 and $126 range, making multiple attempts to overcome local resistance but facing rejections after each effort.

During a broader market bounce, SOL's price surged approximately 5.6%, aiming to establish a base below crucial resistance levels. However, the early correction following this bounce has temporarily pushed SOL below the upper boundary of a six-week falling wedge pattern. Market observer Crypto Jobs noted that this breakout could target the $144-$146 area, contingent on momentum and a confirmed retest of the breakout.

Another analyst, Man of Bitcoin, pointed out that Solana had breached a one-month downtrend line, suggesting a potential move towards the $129-$130 area. However, he emphasized the importance of maintaining momentum above this trendline. Should SOL remain below $146, the possibility of a further decline towards the $100-$105 horizontal support remains plausible. Following the rejection on Monday, he indicated that a decisive break below the trendline could confirm a bearish scenario.

## Higher Timeframe Analysis

Market watcher Elite Crypto has raised concerns regarding Solana's performance on higher timeframes, suggesting the emergence of a multi-year bearish pattern. Specifically, the cryptocurrency appears to be forming a Head and Shoulders pattern with the neckline positioned around the $105 area on a weekly basis. The left shoulder formed during a rally in Q1 2024, while the head and right shoulder developed during the rallies to its latest all-time high in Q1 and Q3 2025, respectively.

If Solana loses the critical $105 support, it could lead to a price decline towards the range of $75 to $51, with this bearish phase potentially extending until mid-2026. Following this period, there may be a shift towards a bullish trend, setting the stage for future gains.

Additionally, another analyst, Henry from Lord of Alts, proposed that Solana has formed a double top formation, with the neckline around current levels. He warned that if Solana fails to hold the current support, it could retrace to the $60 mark, and there is also a risk of a drop to the $35 area in the upcoming months, as there remains a significant gap below that the market has yet to address.
