This growth marks a notable shift towards on-chain finance, as these tokenized instruments are becoming a key component in the institutional investment landscape, reaching a market valuation of $7 billion.

## The Surge of Tokenized US Treasurys

Tokenized US Treasurys have transitioned from being a niche experiment to a substantial market force, now valued at $7 billion. This transformation reflects the increasing acceptance and integration of on-chain finance within institutional investment strategies.
