## Overview

Coinbase has announced a series of significant updates to its platform, enhancing its offerings in trading, borrowing, and institutional services. These developments reflect Coinbase's commitment to expanding its ecosystem and providing users with more robust tools for trading both cryptocurrencies and traditional equities.

## New Features and Services

Coinbase has introduced commission-free trading of stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. This feature allows users to trade equities alongside cryptocurrencies using either USD or USDC, providing a more integrated trading experience.

In addition, Coinbase has launched prediction markets through a partnership with Kalshi. This feature enables users to trade on real-world outcomes, including elections, sports, and economic data, thereby diversifying the types of trades available on the platform.

The platform is also expanding its derivatives access with equity futures and perpetuals trading, which will be available directly within the main Coinbase app. This development is significant as it allows users to engage in more complex trading strategies without needing to navigate multiple platforms.

Another notable addition is the Solana decentralized exchange (DEX) trading via Jupiter. This feature facilitates the swapping of Solana tokens directly on Coinbase, further integrating Solana’s ecosystem into the Coinbase platform.

Coinbase has also introduced new borrowing functionalities, allowing users to borrow against their Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) holdings. This feature empowers users to leverage their cryptocurrency assets without needing to sell them.

Furthermore, Coinbase is launching a token sales feature, enabling initial coin offerings (ICOs) and offering early-stage token support. This change will allow new projects to raise funds and gain visibility within the Coinbase ecosystem.

The Coinbase Tokenize platform is an institutional service designed to support tokenized assets, including tokenized stocks over time. This addition emphasizes Coinbase's focus on institutional clients and the growing trend of tokenization in finance.

The Base app has been globally launched, making Coinbase’s on-chain “everything app” accessible in more than 140 countries. This launch is expected to broaden Coinbase's user base and enhance its global presence.

Coinbase Business has also been made generally available, providing companies with tools for payments, invoicing, and USDC-based solutions. This service aims to streamline business operations in the crypto space.

Additionally, Coinbase has expanded its stablecoin and payments APIs, offering embedded wallets and custom-branded stablecoins for developers. This flexibility allows businesses to create tailored solutions that meet their specific needs.

Lastly, Coinbase has introduced Coinbase Advisor, an AI-powered assistant designed to help users navigate their portfolios and the various products offered by Coinbase. This feature aims to enhance user experience by providing personalized support.
