## Overview

XRP investment products have defied the trend seen in the broader cryptocurrency market by attracting significant inflows, marking a notable performance amidst widespread outflows from other crypto-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). The XRP ETFs recorded a 25-day streak of positive net flows, highlighting strong investor interest in this asset class.

## XRP ETFs' Performance

While many leading crypto ETFs faced substantial outflows last week, XRP investment products managed to stand out, ending the week with over $80 million in inflows. This performance is particularly noteworthy given that the overall crypto investment market experienced nearly a billion dollars in outflows, as reported by CoinShares. The overall digital asset-based funds saw outflows totaling $952 million, marking their fourth-worst weekly performance of the year.

The negative sentiment in the market was largely attributed to delays in the US crypto market structure bill, which had been anticipated to pass before the year's end. According to CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill, this delay has contributed to ongoing regulatory uncertainty for the cryptocurrency asset class. Additionally, concerns over continued selling by whale investors have further exacerbated the negative sentiment. 

The outflows were predominantly observed in the US market, which recorded $990 million in outflows last week. Ethereum funds were the hardest hit, suffering $555 million in outflows, while Bitcoin products experienced $460 million in negative net flows. In stark contrast, XRP ETFs not only avoided outflows but also maintained positive net flows throughout the week, closing with a total of $82.04 million in inflows. This marks a six-week streak of positive performance for XRP.

## XRP's Price Recovery

Amid this influx of investment, XRP's price showed signs of recovery after a recent market correction that had driven its value to a two-month low. Market observers noted that XRP appeared to have completed its downtrend and was stabilizing at a historically significant demand zone. Analysts suggested that selling pressure was diminishing, and structural flattening in price action indicated a potential repositioning by investors.

One trader remarked on the possibility that XRP's corrective phase might be over, highlighting the formation of a double bottom pattern and suggesting that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) had reached a bottom. Another analyst pointed out a bullish divergence in XRP's chart, indicating that price action was adhering to a lower low trendline while forming higher lows on the RSI.

Despite the challenges faced by the broader market, XRP's performance has drawn attention, with various analysts positing that if certain resistance levels are breached, the cryptocurrency could experience significant upward movement.

## From author

The contrasting performance of XRP ETFs against the backdrop of a struggling crypto market underscores the unique dynamics at play within the cryptocurrency sector. While regulatory uncertainties and market corrections have negatively impacted many assets, XRP's resilience suggests that investor sentiment can sometimes diverge from broader market trends. Observing how XRP continues to navigate these challenges will be crucial for both investors and analysts alike.

## Impact on the crypto market

- XRP investment products have seen consistent inflows, attracting over $80 million while other crypto funds faced significant outflows.
- The overall digital asset market experienced nearly $1 billion in outflows, marking a notable shift in investor sentiment.
- The positive performance of XRP ETFs amidst widespread declines suggests a potential shift in investor focus toward specific assets.
