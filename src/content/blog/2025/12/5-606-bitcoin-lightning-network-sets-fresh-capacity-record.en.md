## Overview

This week, the Lightning Network achieved a new record in capacity, reaching approximately 5,606 BTC. Major cryptocurrency exchanges contributed to this growth by increasing their off-chain Bitcoin holdings, enhancing the overall liquidity of the network and altering the dynamics of Bitcoin transactions for users.

## Lightning Network Capacity Growth

The Lightning Network's public capacity saw a significant rise, with reports indicating a peak near 5,637 BTC. This increase reflects a notable improvement from previous levels and establishes the highest total capacity recorded to date. Major exchanges such as Binance and OKX have played a crucial role in this development by adding Bitcoin to Lightning channels. Additionally, other platforms like Kraken and Bitfinex are expanding their support for the network. The primary objective behind these deposits is to expedite the processes of deposits and withdrawals while simultaneously reducing fees for customers.

### Network Activity and Public Nodes

Despite the increase in capacity, there has not been a corresponding surge in the number of public nodes or channels on the Lightning Network. Currently, the public node count is approximately 14,940, while the number of public channels stands at around 48,678. This indicates that while more Bitcoin is accessible within the network, the number of entities facilitating traffic has not grown at the same pace. A portion of the additional liquidity is concentrated in larger, custodial channels operated by exchanges, which can manage significant sums without generating many new public routes. This concentration can complicate the interpretation of on-chain metrics.

Transaction counts and on-chain fee savings illustrate tangible benefits for users, even in the context of a stable node graph. An important metric to consider is the share of exchange traffic being routed through Lightning. Reports indicate that one exchange has successfully routed about 15% of its Bitcoin transactions via Lightning, highlighting meaningful operational shifts at major platforms.

## New Use Cases and Funding

The growth in capacity has also spurred interest in funding and protocol advancements. Tether led a funding round that raised approximately $8 million for a startup focused on facilitating payments over the Lightning Network, showcasing the growing interest in stablecoin transactions within the ecosystem. Furthermore, the announcement of Taproot Assets v0.7 includes features like reusable addresses, a fully auditable asset supply, and improvements for larger, more reliable transactions. These updates lay the groundwork for potential trillions of dollars in transactions on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network.

Protocol upgrades are being implemented to enhance the network's capability to support diverse payment types and token transactions. These advancements suggest that the Lightning Network is evolving beyond simple microtransactions, with applications being tested for remittances, merchant payments, and stablecoin transfers.

## From author

The recent surge in Lightning Network capacity signifies a pivotal moment for Bitcoin transactions, particularly as major exchanges contribute more liquidity. However, the disparity between increased capacity and stable node counts raises questions about the network's decentralization and the implications of relying on custodial channels. The advancements in protocol capabilities, alongside the growing interest in diverse use cases, suggest that the Lightning Network is on a transformative path.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased Lightning Network capacity may lead to more efficient Bitcoin transactions.
- Major exchanges' involvement could enhance user experience through reduced fees and faster transaction times.
- The rising share of exchange traffic routed through Lightning indicates a shift in operational practices among exchanges.
- New funding for startups focused on Lightning payments suggests growing institutional interest in this technology.
- Protocol upgrades may enable a broader range of applications, potentially expanding Bitcoin's use cases beyond simple transactions.
