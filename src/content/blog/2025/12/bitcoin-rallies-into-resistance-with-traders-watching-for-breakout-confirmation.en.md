## Overview

Bitcoin has initiated a fresh increase above the $90,000 mark, currently testing a significant resistance level at $93,000. This movement is crucial as it may determine the direction of Bitcoin's price in the near future.

## Recent Price Movements

Bitcoin's price has experienced a notable surge, starting from the $84,000 zone and moving above $90,000. The cryptocurrency is currently trading above $90,500 and the 100 hourly Simple Moving Average, indicating a bullish trend. A trend line is forming with support at $90,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair, suggesting that Bitcoin may continue its upward trajectory if it can settle above the $93,000 resistance level.

The price had previously reached a high of $92,912 and is now testing an important barrier. Furthermore, it remains above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the upward movement from the $83,870 swing low to the $92,912 high. 

Immediate resistance is noted near the $92,900 level, while the first key resistance is at $93,000. Should Bitcoin close above this level, it may continue to rise towards $93,500 and potentially higher levels, including $95,000 and $96,500. Additional resistance levels for the bulls are identified at $97,200 and $98,000.

## Potential Downward Movement

Conversely, if Bitcoin fails to break through the $93,000 resistance zone, it may face a decline. Immediate support is identified near the $90,800 level, along with the trend line. The first major support level is near $88,400, corresponding to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent upward move. The next support level is at $87,350, and further losses could lead the price towards the $86,000 support level. The main support is situated at $84,000, below which Bitcoin might experience accelerated downward movement.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD is currently gaining momentum in the bullish zone.
- **Hourly RSI**: The RSI for BTC/USD is above the 50 level, indicating bullish sentiment.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Bitcoin's ability to break through the $93,000 resistance may influence market sentiment positively.
- A sustained increase could attract more traders and investors, potentially leading to higher trading volumes.
- Conversely, failure to surpass this resistance could lead to increased selling pressure and a decline in market confidence.
- The support levels identified may serve as crucial indicators for traders looking to manage risk.
- Overall market volatility may increase as traders react to Bitcoin's price movements around these key levels.
