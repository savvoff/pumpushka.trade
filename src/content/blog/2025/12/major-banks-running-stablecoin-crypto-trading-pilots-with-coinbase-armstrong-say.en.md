## Overview

During the DealBook Summit, significant developments in the cryptocurrency space were highlighted. BlackRock's CEO recognized Bitcoin's utility, while Coinbase's CEO announced that the exchange is conducting pilot programs with major US banks focused on stablecoin and crypto trading.

## What Happened

At the recent DealBook Summit, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, acknowledged the utility of Bitcoin. This recognition from a prominent figure in finance underscores the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in traditional financial circles. Meanwhile, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, revealed that the exchange is actively running pilot programs in collaboration with major US banks. These pilots are specifically focused on stablecoin and cryptocurrency trading, indicating a potential shift towards integrating digital assets within established banking frameworks.

Simultaneously, Coinbase's collaboration with major banks signals a significant step forward in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world. This could pave the way for broader adoption of cryptocurrency services and products by banks, enhancing the overall ecosystem.
