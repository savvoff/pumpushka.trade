## Overview

The valuation of XRP, a digital asset designed to serve as a liquidity layer in the global financial system, is under scrutiny. Jesse of Apex Crypto has raised questions regarding the sustainability of XRP's market price, particularly its struggle to maintain a valuation above a few dollars, which he argues does not align with its intended purpose.

## The Liquidity Argument Behind XRP’s Valuation Debate

XRP's price history indicates a persistent challenge in overcoming a price ceiling, with the token failing to sustain levels above $4 since its inception. The peak recorded price has been around $3.65, reached in mid-July. More recently, XRP has been trading below $2 during a weak phase for the broader cryptocurrency market.

Despite the current price struggles, some analysts remain optimistic, speculating that XRP could revisit the $3 region. However, Jesse of Apex Crypto contends that even a $3 valuation fundamentally misrepresents XRP's designed role in global finance. He argues that if XRP were to become a primary liquidity source for cross-border settlements, a valuation around $3 would be inconsistent with that responsibility.

Jesse highlights the importance of understanding what XRP would be backed by or pegged to, noting its connection to substantial pools of global financial assets. These assets could include fiat currencies, potential central bank digital currencies, and commodities like gold or silver. He suggests that the total value represented by XRP tokens should correspond to the combined value of these underlying assets. In essence, if approximately 100 billion XRP were to support liquidity linked to trillions of dollars in global assets, a single-digit price per token would appear mathematically inconsistent.

## Institutional Adoption Versus Price Reality

The debate surrounding XRP's valuation becomes increasingly intricate when considering Ripple's expanding institutional presence. Ripple has forged partnerships with banks, payment providers, and financial institutions across various regions, reinforcing the notion that its technology is gaining traction within traditional finance.

Additionally, Ripple's valuation and funding activities indicate strong confidence from large investors, which Jesse believes should provide a valuation floor for XRP. However, despite this institutional momentum, XRP's market price has not reflected the growth in partnerships and investment interest. Even as XRP-related investment products gain traction and experience steady inflows, the price action remains limited, suggesting that XRP may continue to trade at lower valuations in the near term.

## From author

The ongoing debate regarding XRP's valuation highlights a significant disconnect between its perceived utility in the financial system and its current market price. As Ripple continues to establish itself within the institutional landscape, it raises questions about how market participants value digital assets that are designed to facilitate global liquidity. The future of XRP may hinge on its ability to align its market valuation with its intended function within the financial ecosystem.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The debate around XRP's valuation may influence investor sentiment and decision-making regarding similar digital assets.
- Institutional adoption of Ripple's technology could lead to increased scrutiny of other cryptocurrencies and their valuations.
- A persistent disconnect between XRP's market price and its intended utility may prompt discussions about the broader implications for the valuation of digital assets in general.
- The challenges faced by XRP could serve as a case study for the cryptocurrency market, highlighting the complexities of pricing assets tied to real-world financial systems.
- Continued low valuation of XRP may affect the overall market confidence and investment strategies within the cryptocurrency space.
