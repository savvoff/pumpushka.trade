## Overview

Prediction markets have recently gained significant traction, achieving a remarkable $2 billion in weekly trading volume. This surge in activity is attributed to a decrease in regulatory hostility, which has allowed mainstream organizations, including major entities like CNN and the NHL, to engage with this evolving financial landscape.

## What Happened

In recent times, prediction markets have experienced a notable increase in trading volume, reaching $2 billion weekly. This growth is largely linked to changing regulatory attitudes towards these markets. As regulatory concerns have lessened, more mainstream participants have entered the space, contributing to the rising volume.

Prominent organizations, such as CNN and the NHL, have recognized the potential of prediction markets, which has further propelled interest and participation. The engagement of such well-known entities signifies a shift in perception regarding prediction markets, transitioning them from niche platforms to more widely accepted forms of trading and speculation.

The involvement of mainstream players is particularly significant as it not only legitimizes prediction markets but also attracts a broader audience. This influx of participants can create a more dynamic market environment, potentially leading to increased liquidity and diverse trading strategies.
