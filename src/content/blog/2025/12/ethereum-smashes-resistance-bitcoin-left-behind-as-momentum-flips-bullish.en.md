## Overview

Ethereum has experienced a significant price increase, surpassing key resistance levels and showcasing a bullish momentum. As Ethereum consolidates its gains, the market watches closely to see if it can maintain this upward trajectory, especially in contrast to Bitcoin, which has not shown the same level of momentum.

## Price Movement and Technical Analysis

Ethereum's price began a fresh increase, moving above the $3,250 mark and establishing itself above the $3,200 level. This movement indicates a strengthening position for Ethereum, with the price currently trading above the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A bullish trend line has formed with support at $3,210 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

The price rally has been notable, with Ethereum managing to stay above $3,000 and even pushing above the $3,250 resistance level. The bulls were able to drive the price up to a high of $3,396, although the bears have been active below the $3,400 mark, indicating some resistance in that area. Following this high, Ethereum's price has entered a consolidation phase, demonstrating a minor drop below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the upward wave from the $3,094 swing low to the $3,396 high.

For Ethereum to continue its upward momentum, it needs to clear the $3,380 resistance level. Should this happen, the next significant resistance is positioned near $3,420, and a clear move above this region could suggest further gains ahead. In this scenario, Ethereum might aim for the $3,500 resistance zone or even reach as high as $3,550 in the near term.

However, if Ethereum fails to break through the $3,380 resistance, it could face a decline. Initial support is located near the $3,250 level, which coincides with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the upward wave. The first major support level is around $3,210, and a clear move below this could push the price toward $3,150 or even lower to the $3,050 region. The next significant support level sits at $3,000.

### Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone, indicating a potential continuation of the upward movement.
- **Hourly RSI**: The RSI for ETH/USD is currently above the 50 zone, further supporting the bullish outlook.
