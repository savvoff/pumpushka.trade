## Overview

BlackRock executives have indicated that tokenization, which was previously associated with the crypto frenzy, is now progressing towards a significant transformation of global market infrastructure. This shift could have wide-ranging implications for how markets operate.

## The Shift Towards Tokenization

According to BlackRock executives, the concept of tokenization is evolving and is poised to reshape the fundamental workings of global markets. Historically, tokenization was often viewed through the lens of the crypto boom, but it is now being recognized for its potential to enhance market efficiency and transparency. The executives believe that this transformation could lead to a complete overhaul of existing market plumbing, which refers to the underlying systems and processes that facilitate trading and settlement.

## Importance of the Transformation

The transition towards tokenization signifies a critical moment in the evolution of financial markets. By leveraging digital assets and blockchain technology, tokenization could streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve access to financial markets for a broader range of participants. This development highlights the growing recognition of the utility of tokenized assets beyond speculative trading, indicating a maturation of the market.

## Impact on the Crypto Market
