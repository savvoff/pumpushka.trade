## Overview

France's second-largest banking group, BPCE, has initiated a service that allows customers to trade cryptocurrencies through its mobile apps. This service is currently available to selected users of Banque Populaire and Caisse d’Épargne, marking a significant step in integrating traditional banking with the growing crypto market.

## What Happened

On a recent Monday, BPCE launched a cryptocurrency trading feature for approximately 2 million customers across four regional banks, specifically targeting users in the Provence-Alpes-Côte-d’Azur branch of Caisse d’Épargne and the Île-de-France division of Banque Populaire. Customers can now buy and sell popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and USDC, directly through the banking apps.

This rollout is being approached cautiously. BPCE plans to monitor the initial usage closely to identify and resolve any technical issues, ensuring a smooth user experience before expanding the service. If the initial phase proves successful, BPCE aims to extend this feature to its remaining 25 regional entities, potentially reaching a retail client base of around 12 million by 2026.

To facilitate this service, BPCE has established a dedicated unit named Hexarq, which will manage customer crypto accounts. Each user will have a specific in-app digital asset account, keeping all transactions within the bank’s ecosystem instead of relying on external exchanges or third-party wallets. This arrangement allows for enhanced custody and security of users' digital assets.

However, the service comes with a monthly fee of €2.99 and a trading commission of 1.5% on transactions. Despite these fees being higher than many crypto-first platforms, BPCE believes that the convenience of integrating cryptocurrency trading with traditional banking services may appeal to customers, particularly those who prioritize trust and convenience over lower costs.

## From Author

BPCE's decision to offer cryptocurrency trading represents a significant shift in the banking sector, particularly in response to the increasing competition from fintech companies that have already established their presence in the crypto market. The integration of crypto services within traditional banking could redefine customer expectations and compel other banks to adapt to this evolving landscape.

The move reflects a broader trend where traditional banks are recognizing the necessity of providing innovative financial solutions to retain younger customers who are increasingly inclined towards digital finance options. By creating a controlled environment for crypto trading, BPCE is taking a proactive stance in a rapidly changing financial ecosystem.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- The introduction of crypto trading by a major banking group like BPCE could enhance the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies in the eyes of traditional investors.
- Increased access to cryptocurrency trading through established banks may lead to higher adoption rates among retail customers.
- The service may influence competitive dynamics in the banking sector, prompting other traditional banks to offer similar features to attract and retain customers.
- Higher fees associated with BPCE’s crypto services could lead to discussions about the value of convenience versus cost in financial transactions.
- The cautious rollout strategy of BPCE may set a precedent for other banks to adopt a measured approach when entering the crypto space, focusing on user experience and security.
