## Overview

Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has put forth a new prediction regarding the price trajectory of XRP, suggesting that it could reach $27. He has detailed a technical formation that could lead to a significant price surge for the altcoin, outlining several key price levels based on long-term analysis.

## XRP Price Predictions

In a recent post, Egrag Crypto identified three pivotal price targets for XRP, which are $3.4, $10, and $27. These targets are derived from a long-term Logarithmic Linear Regression Channel, which serves as a basis for his analysis. Each target reflects different phases of market behavior for XRP, emphasizing the importance of these levels in understanding potential future movements.

### The $3.40 Target

Egrag Crypto described the $3.40 target as a mean reversion point. He emphasized that a retest and subsequent rejection from this level would signify a strong bearish technical analysis (TA) signal for XRP. This target, according to the analyst, is determined purely by chart structure rather than any underlying fundamental factors. Conversely, a close above this level would indicate that XRP is re-entering a macro bullish phase.

### The $10 Target

The next significant price level mentioned is the $10 target, which Egrag Crypto refers to as the upper midline of the regression channel. At this level, he suggests that full bull expansion typically accelerates. Importantly, this target is dynamic, as it increases over time due to the logarithmic nature of the channel.

### The $27 Target

Finally, Egrag Crypto highlighted the $27 target as the upper boundary of the channel. He noted that various long-term confluences suggest this level could be achievable for XRP. This optimistic prediction coincides with several favorable developments for XRP, including Ripple's conditional approval for a national trust bank charter, which could enhance XRP's adoption. Additionally, the introduction of a wrapped XRP token for DeFi on the Solana network by Hex Trust signifies further expansion. Moreover, AMINA Bank's integration of Ripple payments that utilize XRP is another positive development for the altcoin.

## Market Levels to Monitor

CasiTrades, another crypto analyst, has pointed out that the major price levels for XRP remain unchanged. The macro support levels are identified at $2.03 and $1.64, while the macro resistance is set at $2.41. A breakthrough above this resistance would confirm a bullish outlook for XRP. If this occurs, the next targets could potentially be around $2.75 and $2.90. Conversely, if XRP falls below the support level of $2.03, it may decline further towards $1.97 and the major support at $1.64. CasiTrades has noted that, at this point, there is no definitive indication of XRP's next price movement.

Additionally, YoungHoon Kim, recognized as the world's largest IQ holder, has mentioned that there is a strong possibility for XRP to reach a new all-time high (ATH) by the end of the year.
