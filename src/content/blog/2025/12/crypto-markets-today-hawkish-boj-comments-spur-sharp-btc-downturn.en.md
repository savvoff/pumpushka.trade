## Overview

A significant downturn in the crypto markets was observed following the opening of CME bitcoin futures. This sell-off was exacerbated by hawkish signals from the Bank of Japan, leading to a notable decline in the CoinDesk 20 index.

## What Happened?

On Monday, the crypto markets experienced a sharp sell-off that coincided with the opening of CME bitcoin futures. This downturn was largely influenced by hawkish comments from the Bank of Japan, which contributed to a negative sentiment in the market. As a result, the CoinDesk 20 index saw a decline of nearly 6%. 

## Impact on the crypto market

- The CoinDesk 20 index fell significantly, indicating a broad market decline.
- The sell-off suggests increased volatility in the crypto markets following traditional market signals.
- The hawkish stance from the Bank of Japan may influence investor sentiment and trading strategies in the crypto space. 
- The opening of CME bitcoin futures appears to correlate with market downturns, raising questions about its impact on price movements.
- Overall market confidence may be affected by macroeconomic indicators from major financial institutions.
