## Overview

Young Hoon Kim, a social media figure who claims to hold the record for the highest IQ, has made a notable announcement regarding XRP, stating, "I buy XRP from now on." This statement comes after a period of promoting Bitcoin, creating significant buzz within the cryptocurrency community. The timing of his endorsement coincides with recent developments involving XRP's integration into the Solana ecosystem, potentially influencing market sentiment.

## Kim's Endorsement of XRP

On December 12, 2025, Young Hoon Kim shared his intention to purchase XRP via a post on X, marking a shift from his recent focus on Bitcoin. His announcement resonated with the XRP community, often referred to as the "XRP Army," which celebrated the endorsement as a significant event. The excitement was further fueled by another user who highlighted that XRP is now available on the Solana blockchain, suggesting this could herald the beginning of an XRP rally.

The Solana official account confirmed the integration, stating that XRP would be introduced through a wrapped-asset structure, enabling it to be traded and utilized within Solana's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Hex Trust, the issuer and custodian for the wrapped token (wXRP), has indicated that this token will be fully backed and redeemable for native XRP, utilizing LayerZero’s OFT standard and initially launching on Solana before expanding to other chains.

This endorsement from Kim comes at a crucial time for XRP holders who have witnessed Solana's growing popularity and liquidity in the memecoin market. The narrative of "XRP, but DeFi-ready" is appealing, especially for those looking to leverage the advantages of DeFi protocols.

## Kim's Recent Focus on Bitcoin

Prior to this announcement, Kim had been vocal about his bullish stance on Bitcoin, making multiple posts that suggested he anticipated a price surge. He characterized Bitcoin's recent price fluctuations as temporary and attributed them to market manipulation. His posts indicated a belief that Bitcoin might be on the verge of entering a new supercycle, with predictions of significant price increases in the near future.

Despite his recent pivot to XRP, Kim's earlier posts had positioned him firmly as a Bitcoin maximalist, leading to curiosity about his sudden endorsement of XRP. His controversial persona, along with claims regarding his IQ, has drawn mixed responses online, and his credibility has been a topic of discussion.
