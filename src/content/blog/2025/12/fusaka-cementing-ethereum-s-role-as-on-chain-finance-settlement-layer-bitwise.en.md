## Overview

Fusaka is set to enhance Ethereum's capabilities as a settlement layer for on-chain finance. This upgrade aims to improve transaction throughput, maintain validator efficiency, and reinforce the value capture of the Ethereum network.

## What Happened

The upcoming upgrade, Fusaka, is designed to address several critical aspects of the Ethereum network. By increasing throughput, the upgrade will allow for more transactions to be processed simultaneously, which is essential for scaling the network to meet growing demand. Additionally, it focuses on maintaining the efficiency of validators, who play a crucial role in securing the network and processing transactions.

One of the most significant features of the Fusaka upgrade is its ability to strengthen Ethereum's value capture mechanism. This is achieved by implementing measures that establish a minimum threshold for blob fees, which are fees associated with certain types of transactions on the network. By putting a floor under these fees, the upgrade aims to enhance the overall economic stability of the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The upgrade is expected to increase Ethereum's transaction processing capacity.
- Improved validator efficiency may lead to a more secure and reliable network.
- Establishing a minimum for blob fees could enhance the economic stability of Ethereum.
- The upgrade may attract more users and developers to the Ethereum platform.
- A stronger Ethereum network could influence the broader on-chain finance landscape.
