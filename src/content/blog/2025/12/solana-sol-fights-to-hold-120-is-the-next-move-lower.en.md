## Overview

Solana's price has faced significant challenges recently, failing to maintain stability above a key threshold. The cryptocurrency has experienced a notable decline, raising concerns about its potential to drop further in value.

## Solana's Recent Price Movement

Solana's price encountered difficulties after failing to settle above $132, leading to a sharp decline. The price has now been consolidating losses below $130 and is at risk of further declines, potentially dipping below $120. The recent movement began with a fresh decline that saw Solana trading below both the $130 and $128 support levels.

As the price lost momentum, it dropped below $126, forming a low at $121. Following this, there was a slight recovery, which allowed the price to test the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward move from the $134 swing high to the $121 low. Currently, Solana is trading below $128 and the 100-hourly simple moving average, indicating a bearish trend.

On the upside, immediate resistance is observed near the $125 level, with subsequent resistance at the $128 level or the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward movement. A key bearish trend line has also formed, with resistance at $131 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. For Solana to initiate any recovery, it will need to defend the support levels at $122 or $120.

If the price fails to break above the $128 resistance, it may continue its downward trajectory. The initial support level is near $122, with the first major support identified at $120. A breach of the $120 level could lead the price to the $112 support zone. In the event of a close below this critical support, further declines toward the $105 support could occur.

## From author

The situation for Solana highlights the volatility and unpredictability inherent in the cryptocurrency market. The failure to maintain key support levels suggests a growing bearish sentiment among traders. Monitoring the price movements and critical support and resistance levels will be essential for anyone looking to understand the future trajectory of Solana.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Solana's struggle to hold above key support levels may reflect broader trends in the cryptocurrency market.
- A potential decline below $120 could signal increased bearish sentiment among investors, impacting related cryptocurrencies.
- The formation of bearish trend lines and resistance levels suggests that traders should remain cautious.
- The price movements may lead to increased volatility in the market, attracting both short-term traders and long-term investors.
- Overall market sentiment could shift if Solana fails to recover, potentially influencing other altcoins and the performance of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
