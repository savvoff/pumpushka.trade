## Overview

ETHZilla has made a significant move by acquiring 20% of the AI lending platform Karus in a deal valued at $10 million. This partnership aims to tokenize auto loans, with the initial portfolios projected to be released by early 2026.

In a strategic investment, ETHZilla has purchased a minority stake in Karus, an AI-driven lending platform. The focus of this collaboration is to innovate the auto loan sector through tokenization. This approach is expected to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of auto loans by leveraging blockchain technology.

- The timeline for portfolio availability may influence market sentiment and expectations around future tokenization initiatives.
