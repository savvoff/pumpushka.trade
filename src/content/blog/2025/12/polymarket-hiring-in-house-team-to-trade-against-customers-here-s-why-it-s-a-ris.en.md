## Overview

Polymarket, a notable player in the prediction market space, is transitioning to an in-house team for market making. This decision has raised concerns among experts regarding potential conflicts of interest and the platform's impartiality.

## What Happened

Polymarket's decision to hire an internal team for trading against customers signifies a shift in its operational strategy. This move is viewed by some experts as a potential blurring of lines between prediction markets and traditional sportsbooks. The concern stems from the idea that an internal trading team might prioritize profitability over fairness, thus undermining the platform's neutrality.

## Why It Matters

The implications of this change are significant. By employing an in-house team to engage in market making, Polymarket risks altering the fundamental principles that underpin its platform. Stakeholders are worried that this could lead to a perception of bias, where the interests of the platform could conflict with those of its users.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Concerns over neutrality may affect user trust in Polymarket.
- Potential shift in user behavior as participants reassess their engagement with the platform.
- Increased scrutiny from experts and analysts regarding the integrity of prediction markets.
- Possible implications for regulatory discussions surrounding prediction markets and their operational frameworks.
- The move could influence other platforms considering similar internal trading strategies.
