## Overview

Polkadot experienced a significant decline, dropping to $2.02 amid a broader market selloff. This movement was marked by a notable technical breakdown that occurred on substantial trading volume.

## What Happened

Polkadot's price fell sharply to $2.02, breaking below the critical support level of $2.05. This decline was characterized by heightened trading activity, which intensified the downward momentum. As a result, the price movement has brought attention to the psychological support level of $2.00, which may play a crucial role in upcoming trading sessions.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The drop in Polkadot's price reflects a broader trend of selling pressure in the cryptocurrency market.
- The breach of the $2.05 support level could signal further volatility for Polkadot and similar assets.
- The focus on the $2.00 psychological level may influence trader sentiment and strategies moving forward.
- Increased trading volume during the decline suggests heightened interest and potential for rapid price movements.
- The situation may prompt market participants to reassess their positions in Polkadot and other cryptocurrencies.
