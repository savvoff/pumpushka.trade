## Overview

Ethereum has recently experienced a fresh increase, surpassing the $3,000 mark and showing signs of potential further gains. Currently, the price is consolidating, with key resistance levels identified that could influence the next movements in the market.

## Recent Price Movements

Ethereum's price began an upward trajectory, breaking through the $3,000 and $3,020 resistance levels. As of now, it is trading above $3,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, indicating a bullish trend. However, a key bearish trend line has formed, presenting resistance at the $3,140 mark on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

Despite a recent setback from the $3,240 zone, where the price witnessed a correction, Ethereum has managed to maintain a position above $2,920. The bulls have remained active in this vicinity, allowing the price to stabilize above the critical thresholds. Should Ethereum manage to settle above the $3,150 zone, it could pave the way for further upward movement.

## Resistance and Support Levels

The current technical analysis indicates that if Ethereum continues its upward trajectory, it may encounter resistance near the $3,140 level due to the established bearish trend line. Following this, the next significant resistance levels are positioned at $3,200 and $3,250. A decisive move above the $3,250 resistance could potentially lead to a surge toward the $3,320 region.

Conversely, should Ethereum fail to breach the $3,140 resistance, it may initiate a decline. Initial support is noted at the $3,050 level, with the first major support situated near the $3,000 zone. A clear drop below this threshold could direct the price toward the $2,950 support area, with further losses potentially leading to the $2,920 region and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the upward wave that began at $2,718 and peaked at $3,240.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD:** The MACD for ETH/USD is currently gaining momentum within the bullish zone, indicating a positive outlook.
- **Hourly RSI:** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for ETH/USD has risen above the 50 mark, further supporting the bullish sentiment.

## From author

The current situation surrounding Ethereum's price movement highlights a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency. As the market consolidates, traders and investors are closely monitoring the resistance and support levels that could dictate Ethereum's trajectory in the near term. The outcome of this consolidation phase will be pivotal in determining whether Ethereum can sustain its recent gains or if it will face downward pressure.
