## Overview

XRP Spot ETFs have achieved a significant milestone by nearing $1 billion in assets under management (AUM). This rapid growth has been noted as one of the fastest ramps since the introduction of Ethereum ETFs, highlighting a strong demand for regulated crypto products in the market.

## XRP ETFs Near $1 Billion AUM

According to disclosures, the four XRP ETF products collectively hold approximately $1.23 billion in total net assets, which translates to around 597 million XRP at a reported price of $2.06. Notably, a recent inflow of $30 million was reported on December 8, contributing to a cumulative net inflow of nearly $935 million into these products. Ripple's CEO emphasized that the collective AUM reached the $1 billion milestone in under four weeks following the market entry of the first fund.

### Performance of Individual Funds

Among the four ETF products, Canary Capital’s XRPC has garnered considerable attention, achieving roughly $245 million in net flows on its debut day on November 13. Currently, this fund holds about 335.889 million XRP, which is valued at approximately $691 million, representing 56% of the total assets across all four funds. Other managers have smaller shares, with Grayscale’s product holding 104.381 million XRP, Bitwise carrying 93.827 million XRP, and Franklin Templeton managing 62.99 million XRP.

## Broader Market Context

This development is part of a larger trend in the cryptocurrency market, characterized by a wave of approved spot and futures crypto ETFs since the introduction of US spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Following suit, Ethereum spot products launched in July 2024, with Solana listings appearing in October 2025. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has approved more than 40 crypto-related ETF products this year, which has provided familiar investment options for mainstream investors.

Vanguard’s recent decision to allow crypto access within standard retirement and brokerage accounts represents a significant shift, enabling many Americans to engage with cryptocurrency without requiring extensive knowledge of the market.

## From Author

The rapid accumulation of assets in XRP ETFs underscores the growing interest in regulated cryptocurrency investment vehicles. The entry of major asset managers into this space has created more accessible options for investors, particularly those looking to incorporate crypto into traditional investment strategies. However, the concentration of assets in a single fund raises concerns about liquidity and potential shifts in investor flows. Observations on trading volumes and fresh inflows will be crucial in determining whether the current momentum can sustain itself across multiple products.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- XRP ETFs approaching $1 billion in AUM indicates a robust demand for regulated crypto products.
- The concentration of assets in a single fund could pose risks to liquidity and fund dynamics if flows change.
- The approval of over 40 crypto-related ETF products this year reflects a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency in mainstream finance.
- Vanguard's decision to include crypto in retirement and brokerage accounts may encourage broader participation from traditional investors.
- The rapid growth of XRP ETFs could influence other cryptocurrencies and their respective ETF products in the market.
