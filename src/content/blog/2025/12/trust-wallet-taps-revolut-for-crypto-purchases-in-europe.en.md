## Overview

Trust Wallet has announced a partnership with Revolut that allows users to make “zero-fee” crypto purchases in Europe. This development comes shortly after Revolut reached a significant milestone, achieving a $75 billion valuation in a private share sale.

## Trust Wallet and Revolut Partnership

In a move aimed at enhancing accessibility to cryptocurrency for European users, Trust Wallet is integrating services with Revolut. This collaboration allows users of Trust Wallet to purchase cryptocurrencies without incurring fees, a feature that could potentially attract a wider audience to digital assets. 

The partnership is particularly notable as it comes on the heels of Revolut's impressive valuation, which highlights the fintech company's growth and influence within the financial technology sector. This valuation indicates a robust investor confidence in Revolut's business model and its future in the crypto landscape. 

The zero-fee structure of crypto purchases through Trust Wallet is significant for a few reasons. Firstly, it lowers the barrier to entry for users who might be hesitant to engage in cryptocurrency transactions due to fees associated with buying and trading. Lowering these costs could lead to increased adoption of cryptocurrencies among users who are new to the market. 

Additionally, this partnership aligns with the broader trend of traditional financial institutions and fintech companies increasingly entering the cryptocurrency space. By facilitating easy and cost-effective access to digital currencies, Trust Wallet and Revolut are positioning themselves as key players in the evolving financial landscape.
