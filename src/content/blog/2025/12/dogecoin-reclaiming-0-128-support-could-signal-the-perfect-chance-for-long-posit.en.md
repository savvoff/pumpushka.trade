## Overview

Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading above a key support level of $0.128, which may determine whether its recent price decline will stabilize or worsen. Analysts are closely monitoring this critical threshold, as it could create favorable conditions for investors considering long positions.

## Analysis of Current Dogecoin Price Action

According to a crypto analyst, the support level at $0.128 is pivotal for Dogecoin's price trajectory. The analyst emphasizes that maintaining a position above this level could shift the outlook to a more bullish sentiment. Specifically, if Dogecoin can hold above $0.128, it may present an enticing opportunity for investors looking to enter long positions.

The recent trading behavior of Dogecoin indicates that it has been in a corrective phase, experiencing a notable decline in price over the past few months. This downturn has coincided with broader market trends and a general risk-off sentiment among investors. The analyst observed that Dogecoin had experienced a sharp sell-off but found temporary stability just above the $0.128 threshold. 

Additionally, Dogecoin's price is currently situated below a highlighted horizontal line on the analyst’s chart, which closely aligns with the support area. The chart projections suggest a potential period of sideways movement between $0.128 and $0.130, followed by a possible upward breakout. The analyst indicates a bullish target near $0.135, which reflects a modest increase from the current price level.

Another analyst, known as Cantonese Cat, has provided a weekly analysis that highlights a prolonged corrective phase in Dogecoin's market structure. This analyst notes that Dogecoin has undergone approximately 13 months of bearish price action, which may align with a potential Wave 2 correction. Such corrections are typically seen as precursors to more significant price movements, suggesting that a Wave 3 could lead to substantial gains for Dogecoin.

Cantonese Cat acknowledges that the current bearish trend may lead many traders to feel skeptical about a bullish outlook for Dogecoin. However, he argues that this skepticism could actually lend credence to the possibility of a substantial price increase. His analysis indicates that Dogecoin's price action is interacting with various Fibonacci retracement levels while also adhering to a long-term downward trendline.
