## Overview

Ethereum has recently experienced a significant upward move but has encountered resistance near the $3,050 mark. As the price struggles to maintain its position, there are indications that it may continue to decline, potentially dropping below the $2,900 level.

## Ethereum's Recent Price Action

Ethereum initiated a recovery wave, managing to rise above the $2,920 and $2,950 levels, similar to the movement observed in Bitcoin. The price briefly surpassed the $3,000 resistance, reaching a high of $3,053 before encountering selling pressure from bears. This resulted in a sharp decline, with the price falling below the key levels of $3,000 and $2,980, ultimately dropping beneath $2,950.

As the price continued to decline, a low was established at $2,907. Currently, Ethereum is trading below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward move from the $3,053 swing high to the $2,907 low. Although the price is now hovering above $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, it remains vulnerable to further losses.

A short-term contracting triangle has formed, presenting resistance at the $2,930 level on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The immediate resistance is noted near the $2,940 level, while the first key resistance is positioned around $2,955. A significant resistance level is also identified near $2,980, close to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward move from the recent high to the established low.

If Ethereum manages to break above the $2,950 resistance, it could lead to a potential rally towards the $3,000 resistance. A successful breach of the $3,000 region may open the door for further gains, possibly pushing Ether towards the $3,050 resistance zone or even higher.

## Potential for Further Decline

However, if Ethereum fails to overcome the $2,955 resistance, it risks entering a fresh decline. Initial support is observed around the $2,900 level, with a critical support zone near $2,880. A clear move below this support could trigger a decline towards the $2,840 level, with further losses potentially leading to a drop towards the $2,800 region. The next significant support level is identified at $2,720.

### Technical Indicators

- **Hourly RSI**: The RSI for ETH/USD is currently below the 50 mark.
