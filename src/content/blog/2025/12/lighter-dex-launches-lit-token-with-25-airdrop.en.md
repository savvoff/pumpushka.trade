## Overview

Lighter DEX has launched its LIT token, a significant development within the decentralized exchange space. The token's supply is divided evenly between the ecosystem and team/investors, with a notable portion allocated for an airdrop to early participants.

## LIT Token Launch Details

The introduction of the LIT token marks an important milestone for Lighter DEX as it aims to enhance its ecosystem and incentivize participation. The total supply of the LIT token is strategically allocated, with half of it designated for the ecosystem and the other half reserved for team members and investors. This balanced distribution is designed to ensure that both the platform's growth and its contributors are adequately supported.

A key feature of the LIT token launch is the airdrop, which allows early participants to receive a portion of the token supply. This initiative serves multiple purposes: it rewards early adopters, encourages user engagement, and aims to foster a sense of community within the Lighter DEX platform. By distributing tokens to those who have shown interest in the platform from its early stages, Lighter DEX is not only incentivizing participation but also promoting loyalty among its users.

The decision to implement a 25% airdrop signifies the platform's commitment to building a user-centric ecosystem. Airdrops have become a common strategy in the crypto space to enhance visibility and attract users, and Lighter DEX's approach aligns with this trend. By providing early users with tokens, Lighter DEX hopes to create a robust and active community that will contribute to the platform's ongoing development and success.
