## Overview

US Representative Maxine Waters has formally requested an oversight hearing with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins. She aims to discuss recent SEC decisions that she believes undermine the enforcement of securities laws, particularly in the context of high-profile crypto cases.

## SEC Oversight Hearing Request

In her letter to House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill, Waters expressed concern about the SEC's termination or delay of several significant crypto enforcement actions. These actions reportedly involve notable companies and individuals, including Coinbase, Binance, Justin Sun, Kraken, and Ripple. The request highlights nine specific areas of concern regarding the SEC's recent conduct, questioning whether enforcement choices were influenced by legal judgment or external pressures.

Waters emphasized the importance of transparency, stating that the public deserves clarity about changes in the SEC's enforcement strategy and how investor protections will be maintained. As the ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, she is advocating for accountability from the SEC regarding its recent decisions.

## Concerns About Politicization and Investor Protections

Waters raised alarms about the SEC's handling of cases since the administration of a previous US President, suggesting a marked difference in enforcement patterns compared to earlier periods. She argued that these changes could signify a deterioration of investor protections within the crypto space. This perspective has been echoed by industry observers and various media outlets, which have noted the significant shifts in crypto policy and regulatory frameworks occurring over the past year.

The timing of Waters' letter, sent late in December, suggests increasing pressure from Democrats who may seek to regain more committee influence. This context underscores the political dimensions of the regulatory landscape as lawmakers prepare for potential oversight.

## What Waters Expects from the SEC

Waters is seeking specific answers from the SEC regarding the rationale behind the dropping or delaying of certain cases. Her inquiries include requests for information on the internal analyses that informed these decisions, the impact of staff reductions or policy shifts on enforcement actions, and a public appearance by Chairman Atkins before the committee for questioning.

## Committee Role and Next Steps

Reports indicate that Waters delivered her letter to Chairman Hill on December 29, 2025, urging him to schedule an oversight hearing without delay. Such a hearing could provide a platform for examining documents and obtaining testimony from SEC officials, allowing committee members to scrutinize how decisions related to major crypto matters were made. The timeline for this hearing will depend on the committee's scheduling and whether Hill agrees to convene a formal public session.

## From author

The call for an oversight hearing by Representative Waters highlights the growing scrutiny of the SEC's actions in the crypto space. As the regulatory environment evolves, the implications of these enforcement decisions could have far-reaching effects on how cryptocurrencies are governed and how investors are protected. The dynamics between lawmakers and regulatory agencies will likely shape the future of crypto oversight in the United States.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased scrutiny on SEC enforcement actions may lead to greater transparency in regulatory processes.
- Potential changes in enforcement strategies could affect investor confidence in the crypto market.
- The hearing may prompt lawmakers to propose new legislation affecting crypto regulations.
- Industry stakeholders will closely monitor the outcomes of the hearing for insights into future SEC actions.
- The political landscape surrounding crypto regulation may shift as oversight efforts gain momentum.
