## Overview

In 2025, several prominent blockchains experienced significant declines in on-chain activity. This downturn followed a series of viral moments that, while initially driving excitement, ultimately did not result in sustained growth for these platforms. Among the most affected were Ronin and ZKsync, which saw the steepest declines in their respective on-chain metrics.

## Decline in On-chain Activity

The blockchain ecosystem is often influenced by spikes in activity due to viral events, but these moments can lead to temporary surges rather than long-term engagement. In the case of Ronin and ZKsync, the viral moments that initially captivated users failed to translate into ongoing participation or investment in their networks.

Ronin, known for its connection to the Axie Infinity game, experienced a notable drop in user engagement. ZKsync, recognized for its layer-2 scaling solution, similarly faced a decline in on-chain metrics. This trend highlights a critical issue within the blockchain space: the challenge of converting short-term spikes in interest into lasting user activity.

The decline in on-chain metrics for these blockchains raises questions about the sustainability of growth in the crypto ecosystem. It underscores the importance of building robust, engaging platforms that encourage users to remain active beyond initial excitement. As the market matures, the ability to maintain user interest and activity will be crucial for the longevity of blockchain projects.

## From author

The observed declines in on-chain metrics for Ronin and ZKsync signal a broader trend within the blockchain industry. While viral moments can serve as catalysts for engagement, they are not sufficient for ensuring sustained growth. This phenomenon suggests that blockchain projects must prioritize long-term strategies that foster user retention and continuous interaction.

Moreover, the downturn in activity on these platforms may have implications for overall market confidence and investment. Stakeholders may begin to scrutinize the viability of projects that rely heavily on transient spikes of interest rather than establishing a solid foundation for ongoing engagement.

In analyzing the situation, it becomes evident that the blockchain sector must adapt to evolving user expectations. Projects that can innovate and create compelling experiences for users will likely be better positioned to thrive in a competitive landscape.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The decline in on-chain metrics for Ronin and ZKsync may lead to decreased investor confidence in similar projects.
- A trend of short-lived spikes in user activity could deter new users from engaging with blockchain platforms.
- The situation emphasizes the need for projects to focus on sustainable growth strategies.
- A potential shift in user behavior may result in increased demand for platforms that prioritize long-term engagement.
- The overall crypto market may see adjustments as investors reassess the viability of projects based on their ability to maintain user interest.
