## Overview

Ethereum has faced significant downward pressure throughout December, culminating in a decline below the $3,000 mark. This drop has had a pronounced impact on investor positioning, with on-chain data indicating a marked decline in profitability among Ethereum holders.

## Ethereum's Profitability Decline

The recent downturn in Ethereum's price has led to a notable decrease in the share of ETH supply that is currently in profit. As reported, this percentage has fallen below 60%, a significant indicator of investor distress. Earlier in December, the percentage of ETH supply in profit was above 70%. Following a brief recovery that saw Ethereum reclaim the $3,000 level on December 22, the positive momentum was short-lived, as prices quickly fell back below this threshold. This decline reflects broader market trends and suggests that losses are not confined to recent purchasers; even those who acquired Ethereum earlier in the month are now experiencing unrealized losses.

## Institutional Demand Weakens

In addition to the deteriorating on-chain profitability, institutional interest in Ethereum appears to be waning. Data from Glassnode indicates that the 30-day moving average of net flows into US Spot Ethereum ETFs has been negative since early November. This sustained trend of outflows highlights a period of reduced engagement from institutional traders, which is critical given that ETF demand has historically provided substantial buying pressure for Ethereum. The fading inflows, which previously supported Ethereum's price increases, have been replaced by continuous outflows throughout November and December. This shift is essential to understanding the current price dynamics, as the diminished institutional demand has made it more challenging for Ethereum to withstand sell-side pressure.

## Whale Activity and Market Sentiment

Further complicating the situation, various on-chain analytics have revealed that certain whale addresses are decreasing their exposure to Ethereum. Notably, a wallet associated with Erik Voorhees reportedly swapped a significant amount of ETH into Bitcoin Cash after a prolonged period of inactivity. However, Voorhees clarified that the wallet in question does not belong to him. Additionally, Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, has reportedly sold a considerable amount of ETH recently, further contributing to the selling pressure in the market.

## From author

The current landscape for Ethereum investors is marked by increasing losses and declining institutional interest. The combination of falling prices and reduced profitability among holders suggests a challenging environment for Ethereum moving forward. Investors must navigate these dynamics carefully, as the interplay between institutional demand and retail sentiment continues to shape the market.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Ethereum's decline below $3,000 reflects broader market trends, impacting investor sentiment and positioning.
- The drop in the share of ETH supply in profit indicates increasing unrealized losses among investors.
- Weakness in institutional demand, evidenced by negative ETF net flows, suggests reduced buying pressure in the market.
- Whale activity and selling pressure from notable figures may further exacerbate the challenges facing Ethereum.
- The overall environment could lead to increased volatility and uncertainty for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market.
