## Overview

According to a recent statement from Bitwise researcher Ryan Rasmussen, the landscape of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) is poised for significant growth, with expectations for a rapid increase in their availability and adoption by the year 2026. This anticipated surge is being described as entering a "cheesecake factory" era, indicating a diverse and abundant selection of products.

## Expected Growth of Crypto ETPs

Ryan Rasmussen, a researcher at Bitwise, has projected that the number of crypto ETPs will experience substantial acceleration in the coming years, particularly in 2026. This statement underscores a belief that the market for these financial instruments will evolve dramatically, offering a wide array of options for investors.

The term “cheesecake factory” suggests a metaphorical comparison to a well-known restaurant chain, which is famous for its extensive menu and variety of offerings. In this context, it implies that the crypto ETP market will not only grow in size but also in diversity, catering to a wide range of investor preferences and needs. 

The importance of this growth cannot be overstated. ETPs provide a way for investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without the need to directly purchase and manage digital assets. They offer a more traditional investment vehicle, which can appeal to a broader audience, including those who may be hesitant to engage with the complexities of the crypto market directly.

## From author

The insights shared by Ryan Rasmussen reflect a growing trend in the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrency-related investment products. As regulatory frameworks evolve and financial markets adapt to incorporate digital assets, the potential for a diverse array of ETPs could serve to normalize cryptocurrency investments. This transformation may attract new investors who prefer the traditional structure and perceived stability of ETPs over direct cryptocurrency holdings.

The predicted expansion of crypto ETPs could also indicate an increasing confidence in the cryptocurrency market as a whole. As more products become available, it suggests that both providers and investors see a viable and sustainable future for cryptocurrencies in the financial ecosystem. The metaphor of a "cheesecake factory" could also imply that investors will have the luxury of choice, allowing them to tailor their portfolios according to individual preferences and risk profiles.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The anticipated growth in crypto ETPs could lead to increased mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.
- A wider variety of products may attract a broader range of investors, enhancing market liquidity.
- The expansion of ETPs may provide a more stable investment vehicle for those wary of direct cryptocurrency investment.
- Increased competition among ETP providers could lead to lower fees and better offerings for investors.
- The development of more sophisticated and diverse ETPs might encourage innovation within the cryptocurrency space.
