## Overview

The Base network is experiencing significant pushback from its builders due to concerns over favoritism related to its close alignment with Zora. The builders argue that this focus on the creator-coin narrative is overshadowing established projects, raising questions about equity and support within the ecosystem.

## The Situation

Builders on the Base network have voiced their concerns regarding the platform's apparent preferential treatment toward Zora, a project that emphasizes creator coins. This alignment has sparked a backlash among developers and creators who feel that the existing projects are being sidelined in favor of newer initiatives. The crux of the issue lies in the perception that the creator-coin narrative, which promotes the idea of individual creators having their own coins, may not adequately support or recognize the contributions and innovations of established projects within the Base ecosystem.

The situation is significant as it highlights a growing tension between new narratives in the crypto space and the existing frameworks that have already been built. Builders are concerned that focusing too heavily on the creator-coin concept could lead to an imbalance in resource allocation, visibility, and overall support for projects that have been foundational to the network's development. This potential favoritism raises questions about the strategic direction of the Base network and its commitment to a diverse range of projects and innovations.

Furthermore, the pushback from builders signifies a broader concern within the crypto community about how networks are governed and how decisions are made regarding support and funding. The implications of this situation extend beyond Base, as it reflects ongoing discussions in the crypto space about inclusivity, equity, and the importance of recognizing the contributions of all participants, regardless of their stage of development.

## From author

This situation on Base serves as a reminder of the complexities involved in managing a vibrant ecosystem where new ideas compete for attention alongside established projects. The concerns raised by builders reflect a crucial dialogue about the need for equitable support structures within decentralized networks. It is essential for platforms like Base to consider the feedback from their builder community to foster an environment that encourages innovation while also valuing the foundational work that has already been accomplished.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The backlash highlights potential governance issues within blockchain networks, raising concerns over how projects are prioritized.
- It underscores the importance of inclusivity in crypto ecosystems, which could influence how new projects are developed and supported moving forward.
- The situation may prompt other networks to reassess their support strategies to avoid similar tensions and foster a more balanced growth environment.
- Increased scrutiny on favoritism could lead to greater transparency and accountability in how projects are aligned and supported within ecosystems.
- The discourse surrounding creator coins versus established projects may shape future funding and development strategies across various blockchain platforms.
