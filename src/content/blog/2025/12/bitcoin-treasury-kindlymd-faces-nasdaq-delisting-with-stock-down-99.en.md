## Overview

KindlyMD, a company that operates a Bitcoin treasury, has received a warning regarding a potential delisting from Nasdaq. This warning comes as the company's shares have experienced a significant decline, dropping below the $1 threshold. The firm has until June 2026 to address this compliance issue and avoid being removed from the exchange.

## What Happened

The company's shares falling below the $1 mark is a critical threshold that exchanges monitor closely to ensure companies maintain a minimum share price for continued listing. This situation places KindlyMD in a precarious position, as the company must now focus on strategies to restore its stock price above the required level.

This warning is significant not only for KindlyMD but also for its investors and stakeholders. A delisting from Nasdaq could lead to reduced liquidity for the company’s shares, making it more challenging for investors to buy and sell their stakes. The potential loss of credibility associated with a delisting may also affect the company’s future fundraising efforts, partnerships, and overall market perception.
