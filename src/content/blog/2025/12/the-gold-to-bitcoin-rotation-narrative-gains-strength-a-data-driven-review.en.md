## Overview

Bitcoin is currently striving to reclaim the $90,000 threshold, yet it remains constrained below this significant psychological level. Analysts are expressing concerns over the market's overall structure, suggesting a potential transition into a bear market phase, particularly as volatility continues and upward momentum stalls.

## Current Market Situation

Despite several brief relief rallies, Bitcoin's price action has failed to maintain momentum, raising alarms among market participants. The sentiment in both derivatives and spot markets has taken a cautious turn, indicating a diminishing appetite for risk. This evolving atmosphere has prompted discussions about the possibility of Bitcoin entering a bear market.

In this context, a recent report by Darkfost revisits the narrative of capital rotation from gold into Bitcoin. With gold recently achieving a new all-time high, the idea that investors might pivot toward Bitcoin has resurfaced. Historically, this narrative has gained traction during periods when traditional safe-haven assets, like gold, outperform, leading to speculation that Bitcoin could serve as an alternative store of value.

However, Darkfost provides a critical perspective, asserting that the assumption of capital rotation from gold to Bitcoin is not firmly established. Although this narrative has been frequently mentioned during the current cycle, the empirical evidence supporting a direct correlation between gold's performance and sustained inflows into Bitcoin is weak. Instead of signaling an imminent bullish trend, the current market situation suggests that Bitcoin may remain vulnerable, caught between macroeconomic narratives and a declining internal market structure.

### Testing the Gold-to-Bitcoin Rotation Thesis

Darkfost emphasizes that the prevalent narrative of capital rotation from gold to Bitcoin lacks direct and verifiable evidence. To investigate this further, he created a comparative framework aimed at identifying potential periods of such rotations without presuming a causal relationship. One of the core challenges he identifies is the inability of on-chain and market data to definitively demonstrate that capital leaving gold is re-entering Bitcoin.

To approximate potential rotation phases, Darkfost implemented a structured signal methodology. A positive signal is indicated when Bitcoin trades above its 180-day moving average while gold trades below its own 180-day moving average, suggesting relative strength shifting toward Bitcoin. Conversely, a negative signal occurs when both assets trade below their respective moving averages, indicating a broader risk-off environment rather than a simple rotation.

This methodology enables historical comparisons across different market cycles, revealing instances of diverging relative performance. However, the findings call into question the simplicity of the rotation narrative. The signals generated do not consistently produce reliable outcomes, with some rotation periods failing to yield sustained upside for Bitcoin, while at other times, Bitcoin has rallied independently of gold's performance. 

The conclusion drawn is that capital rotation between gold and Bitcoin is not a straightforward or automatic process. Instead, market behavior is influenced by more complex factors, including macroeconomic conditions, liquidity dynamics, and investor positioning.

### Price Struggles Below Key Moving Averages

Currently, Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize following a sharp corrective phase. However, its price action remains structurally fragile. As Bitcoin trades just below the $90,000 level, this area has shifted from support to near-term resistance after a recent breakdown. Despite showing short-term buying interest, the broader bearish structure established after the October highs remains intact.

From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin is currently trading below the 50-3D moving average, which has begun to slope downward, signaling weakening momentum. The inability to reclaim this level indicates that recent upward movements are corrective rather than indicative of a trend reversal. Below the current price, the 100-3D moving average has acted as interim support during recent rebounds, but a sustained loss of this area could expose Bitcoin to a deeper retracement.
