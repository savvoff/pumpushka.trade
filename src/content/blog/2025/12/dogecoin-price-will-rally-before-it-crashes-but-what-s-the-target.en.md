## Overview

The Dogecoin price is currently facing significant challenges as it continues to struggle under bearish pressure in the crypto market. After an initial drop, attempts to recover have faltered, leading to further declines below critical support levels. A recent analysis suggests that while there may be a temporary rally, a more severe crash could be on the horizon.

## Current Price Situation

Dogecoin has recently experienced a downturn, falling to a price level that has raised concerns among investors. Initially, the price dropped to $0.2, prompting attempts from DOGE bulls to maintain support and initiate a rebound. However, these efforts have been unsuccessful, with the price now trading below the $0.15 support level. The bearish sentiment in the market has contributed to this decline, indicating a challenging environment for the cryptocurrency.

Analyst Weslad has highlighted a corrective structure that has emerged on Dogecoin’s price chart, identifying a bearish flag formation. This pattern has been interpreted as a precursor to further declines, leading to a negative sentiment surrounding Dogecoin's future price movements. The bearish flag has reportedly triggered a breakdown, resulting in the current downward trend.

## Potential Price Movements

Despite the troubling price performance, Weslad's analysis suggests that there may be a temporary relief rally for Dogecoin. He notes that the price remains well below its breakout zone, indicating a possibility for an initial increase. If this rally occurs, it is anticipated that the price may briefly decline below $0.12, establishing support above $0.118. Following this, a bounce could push the price back up to $0.2.

However, the outlook does not remain positive beyond this potential rally. Weslad warns that after reaching the $0.2 mark, Dogecoin could face an even steeper decline, potentially dropping by a significant margin toward $0.05. This scenario would represent a return to levels not seen in two years, further compounding the challenges faced by Dogecoin investors.

The immediate plan, as outlined by the analyst, involves monitoring for a pullback toward the bearish flag targets around the $0.12 region. This area is expected to serve as a supply zone on retests, which could trigger the next leg of the decline.
