## Overview

Solana (SOL) has recently experienced a decline, falling below significant price levels. The cryptocurrency is currently consolidating losses and shows signs of potential further declines if certain support levels are breached.

## Price Movement and Market Context

Solana's price has slipped below the $135 zone, marking a fresh decline. After failing to maintain stability above the $140 level, SOL's price fell below both the $135 and $130 support levels. Currently, it is trading under $130 and is below the 100-hourly simple moving average, indicating a bearish trend.

A low was established at $123, and while there was a minor recovery, the price remains below the critical resistance levels. The immediate resistance is near $128, with further resistance at $130. A bearish trend line is also forming, with resistance at $136 on the hourly chart. Should the price break above this level, it could signal an opportunity for a recovery.

If the price does not manage to rise above the $130 resistance, there is a risk of further declines. The initial support level is near $125, followed by major support at $122. A drop below $122 could lead to a decline toward the $120 support zone, and if this level is breached, the price could potentially fall to $112.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for SOL/USD is showing increased bearish momentum.
- **Hourly RSI**: The RSI for SOL/USD is currently below the 50 level, indicating weakness.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Solana's decline reflects broader market trends affecting major cryptocurrencies.
- The potential for further declines could create a more cautious sentiment among investors.
- The formation of key resistance levels may influence trading strategies and decisions.
- Market participants will be watching support levels closely to assess potential price movements.
- A failure to recover may lead to increased volatility in the SOL market.
