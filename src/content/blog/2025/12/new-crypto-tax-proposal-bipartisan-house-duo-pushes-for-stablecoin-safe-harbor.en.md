## Overview

A new bipartisan proposal has emerged from U.S. lawmakers aimed at reforming the tax framework for stablecoin transactions. Representatives Max Miller and Steven Horsford are working on a draft that seeks to align the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies with traditional securities, providing clarity and a potential safe harbor for certain transactions.

## Proposal Details

The proposed tax framework comes in response to the evolving landscape of crypto regulation, particularly following changes initiated by the White House administration. The draft legislation aims to exempt capital gains tax for transactions involving regulated stablecoins, specifically transactions that maintain a value between $0.99 and $1.01. This exemption is limited to transactions under a specified threshold, which remains subject to change based on further discussions among lawmakers.

In addition to stablecoin transactions, the proposal addresses the taxation of rewards from activities such as staking and mining. Staking involves the process of verifying blockchain transactions, and the current IRS guidance treats such rewards as taxable income upon receipt. This has raised concerns among Republican lawmakers who argue that taxing these assets before any realization of gain is unfair. Conversely, Democrats believe these rewards should be classified as compensation, thus necessitating immediate taxation.

To bridge this divide, Miller and Horsford's draft suggests allowing taxpayers to defer taxes on staking rewards for up to five years. After this deferral period, the rewards would then be taxed as income based on their fair market value at the time of taxation.

The proposal also seeks to bring digital assets under a tax regime similar to that of securities and commodities. It aims to extend capital gains tax exemptions to foreign investors trading securities through U.S.-based brokers or exchanges. Additionally, the draft allows cryptocurrency traders to adopt mark-to-market accounting, enabling them to account for unrealized gains and losses based on the fair market value at the end of each year.

Another important aspect of the proposed legislation is its focus on addressing wash trading practices in the cryptocurrency market. The draft seeks to impose restrictions on the deduction of losses from wash trades, aiming to close loopholes that allow for the deferral of tax liabilities while locking in gains.

## From author

This bipartisan initiative reflects a significant step towards creating a more structured and fair taxation system for digital assets. By providing exemptions and clarifications, the proposal aims to foster a more conducive environment for both taxpayers and the growing cryptocurrency market. The ongoing discussions among lawmakers highlight the complexities of integrating modern financial technologies into existing tax frameworks.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The proposal could enhance the attractiveness of stablecoins by providing tax exemptions, potentially increasing their usage in transactions.
- A clear tax framework may encourage more investors to engage with cryptocurrencies, knowing the tax implications are more favorable and predictable.
- The deferred taxation on staking rewards could lead to increased participation in blockchain projects, as it lowers the immediate tax burden on participants.
- Aligning digital assets with the securities tax regime could bring more legitimacy and regulatory clarity to the crypto market, attracting institutional investors.
- Addressing wash trading practices may lead to a more transparent and fair trading environment, fostering greater trust in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
