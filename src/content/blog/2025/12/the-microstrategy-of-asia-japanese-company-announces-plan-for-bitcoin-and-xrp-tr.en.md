## Overview

AltPlus, a publicly listed company in Japan, has announced its plan to integrate Bitcoin and XRP into its long-term treasury strategy. This significant corporate shift underscores the growing acceptance of digital assets in institutional finance and marks a notable step for crypto adoption in Japan.

## AltPlus' Treasury Strategy

In a recent shareholder filing, AltPlus revealed its intention to formally incorporate Bitcoin and XRP as foundational elements of its financial and operational framework. The company plans to establish a new division dedicated to the purchase and management of these cryptocurrencies. This initiative is part of a long-term capital strategy that emphasizes blockchain transparency, global regulatory clarity, and the increasing institutional acceptance of digital assets.

### Key Attributes of Bitcoin and XRP

AltPlus has highlighted several key attributes of Bitcoin and XRP that it believes will contribute to their long-term value growth and utility within financial markets. These attributes include:

- Scarcity
- Decentralization
- Predictability
- Fast and low-cost transactional capabilities

### Strengthening Financial Base

The treasury initiative aims to enhance the company's financial foundation by diversifying revenue streams and establishing a stable income source through staking. AltPlus views this approach as a structured method to improve capital efficiency and reinforce corporate value over time. By holding both Bitcoin and XRP, the company aligns its financial strategy with emerging trends in digital asset management.

### Risk Management Framework

To mitigate risks associated with the cryptocurrency market, AltPlus has outlined a comprehensive risk-management system. This system addresses various factors, including:

- Crypto-market volatility
- Liquidity risks
- Cybersecurity threats
- Regulatory changes
- Speculative trading patterns

The company plans to implement investment-scale limits and a controlled holding-ratio strategy, alongside a proprietary asset-management system to oversee acquisition, custody, tracking, and treasury integration.

## Expansion into Digital Assets and Web3

Beyond its treasury allocation, AltPlus is positioning Bitcoin and XRP as crucial components of its broader transition into digital asset operations and Web3 business development. The filing emphasizes that global financial institutions and listed companies are increasingly adopting crypto assets for holding, settlement, and capital management.

### Integration of Blockchain Infrastructure

AltPlus intends to integrate blockchain infrastructure into its Entertainment and Solutions business. This includes exploring Web3 functionalities and developing token-based engagement models within its gaming and intellectual property ecosystem. These initiatives aim to create new business models, enhance operational flexibility, and foster internal expertise in a digital-native market environment.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- AltPlus' move signifies increasing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies in Japan.
- The integration of Bitcoin and XRP into corporate treasury strategies may influence other companies to adopt similar practices.
- The emphasis on risk management could encourage more businesses to explore crypto assets while ensuring compliance and governance.
- AltPlus' focus on Web3 and digital assets may drive innovation within the gaming and entertainment sectors.
- The incorporation of XRP alongside Bitcoin highlights a growing recognition of diverse digital assets within corporate strategies.
