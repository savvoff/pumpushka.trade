## Overview

BlackRock, the largest asset manager globally, has officially filed for a staked Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This significant move comes amid a bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, where Ethereum's price is trying to break free from a two-month resistance level.

## BlackRock Files for Staked Ethereum ETF

The filing, submitted in the form of an S-1 document, seeks approval for the iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ETHB). The fund aims to reflect the performance of Ethereum's price while also generating rewards from staking a portion of the Trust’s ether. The proposal outlines that if approved, the fund plans to stake between 70% to 90% of its Ethereum holdings, with staking rewards distributed to stakeholders at least quarterly.

In terms of custodianship, Coinbase Custody Trust will manage the Trust's ETH holdings, while Anchorage Digital Bank will serve as an alternative custodian. The Bank of New York Mellon will oversee the Trust's cash holdings and administer the Trust itself. Notably, the ETHB will operate independently from BlackRock's existing spot ETH fund, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), which currently stands as the largest fund in its category, boasting $11 billion in assets under management.

Speculation regarding BlackRock's staked Ethereum fund began after the asset manager registered the fund's name in Delaware last month. A report from 10x Research suggested that the introduction of such a fund would likely lead to increased scrutiny of Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), particularly regarding their embedded costs, which can exceed management fees associated with traditional asset managers like BlackRock.

## Ethereum Nears Key Downtrend Line

As the week commenced, Ethereum's price made an attempt to reclaim a critical area, managing to hold the $3,000 level as support despite recent market volatility. The cryptocurrency experienced a surge of nearly 3%, reaching $3,180 before experiencing a retracement. Analysts have noted that Ethereum is approaching a crucial level that could catalyze a price increase.

Ethereum briefly broke above its two-month downtrend line, which has acted as resistance since early October. However, it faced rejection during this attempt. Analysts suggest that if Ethereum can reclaim the $3,120-$3,130 levels and convert the downtrend into support, it may create a foundation for retesting higher price levels between $3,200 and $3,300.

Additionally, Ethereum Dominance (ETHDOM) is reportedly maintaining its position within a macro consolidation range, holding support at the 11.67% level. Analysts have noted that maintaining above the 10.05% level could position ETHDOM for future growth in market dominance.
