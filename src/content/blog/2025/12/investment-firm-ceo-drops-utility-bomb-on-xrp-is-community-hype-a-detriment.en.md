## Overview

In a recent discussion, Galaxy Digital's leadership highlighted the critical relationship between community loyalty and real-world utility in the cryptocurrency market. CEO Mike Novogratz and Head of Research Alex Thorn specifically addressed XRP and Cardano, questioning the sustainability of their communities amidst a landscape with numerous viable alternatives.

## Community Versus Utility

During the YouTube discussion focused on expectations for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, Novogratz emphasized the importance of utility in capital allocation. He posed a significant question regarding how investors decide among various options, stating that if capital can flow into ventures like SpaceX, cryptocurrencies must compete on similar terms.

Both XRP and Cardano are recognized for having dedicated communities. However, Novogratz raised concerns about whether this loyalty can endure if tangible utility is not evident within these ecosystems. He queried, “Can Ripple hold it together? Can Cardano hold it together?” 

In his analysis, Novogratz referenced Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, noting his ability to maintain community engagement over time, despite the platform not being widely utilized. He expressed similar sentiments regarding XRP, pointing out the strength of its community while questioning its sustainability in an evolving market with increasing options.

The current dynamics of the crypto market have led to a more selective capital flow. Developers and teams behind various blockchain ecosystems are acutely aware of this trend, which has prompted a rush to showcase usage, revenue models, and clear value propositions tied directly to their respective tokens. Novogratz indicated that establishing such utility is not an immediate process, suggesting it typically requires a year rather than just a few months.

## Cardano and XRP's Initiatives 

The timing of these discussions is notable, as both Cardano and XRP are actively working to enhance their utility narratives. Cardano is pursuing this objective through initiatives like the Midnight sidechain, which is designed to support confidential smart contracts and selective data disclosure. This privacy-focused network aims to attract enterprise and institutional use cases that necessitate compliance-friendly solutions, an area where public blockchains have historically faced challenges.

Conversely, XRP is enhancing its utility through efforts by Ripple to expand the functionality of the XRP Ledger. This includes the promotion of Ripple USD (RLUSD), a US dollar-backed stablecoin, with broader deployment planned across multiple Layer-2 networks. Additionally, Ripple has engaged in a series of partnerships aimed at solidifying the utility of the XRP ecosystem. Notably, the company has committed substantial resources, reportedly around $4 billion, to major acquisitions in 2025. Ripple has also recently partnered with Doppler Finance to explore collaborative efforts in developing XRP-based yield infrastructure and tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) on the XRP Ledger.

## From author

The ongoing dialogue regarding the intersection of community loyalty and utility in the cryptocurrency space underscores the challenges that established projects like XRP and Cardano face. As the market matures, the necessity for demonstrable utility becomes increasingly critical. The initiatives being undertaken by these projects reflect an awareness of this reality and a commitment to adapting to the evolving landscape.

## Impact on the crypto market
