## Overview

Bitcoin's recent bounce has diminished as the weekly close nears, leading traders to express concerns over multiple risk-off metrics indicating a significant risk of correction for the cryptocurrency. Despite this, some traders perceive Bitcoin priced below $100,000 as a discount.

## Current Situation

As the weekly close for Bitcoin approaches, the cryptocurrency has experienced a loss of momentum, with its recent bounce fading. Traders have identified several risk-off metrics that suggest a heightened risk of a correction in Bitcoin's price. This situation raises questions about the future trajectory of Bitcoin, including speculation about the possibility of reaching $100,000 by the end of 2025.
