## Overview

CoinShares has reported a significant increase in the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), highlighting a 229% surge in 2025, primarily driven by US Treasurys. The firm anticipates that the demand for dollar-yield assets will continue to propel on-chain growth into 2026.

## Tokenization of Real-World Assets

The report from CoinShares indicates a remarkable rise in the tokenization of RWAs, with a specific focus on US Treasurys. This substantial growth in 2025 is attributed to the increasing interest among investors in tokenized assets that provide yield in a familiar and stable currency, the US dollar. The trend reflects a broader movement within the financial sector to integrate traditional assets with blockchain technology, allowing for greater liquidity and accessibility.

Tokenization of assets refers to the process of converting physical or traditional assets into digital tokens that can be traded on a blockchain. This method allows for fractional ownership, thereby enabling a wider array of investors to participate in markets that were previously inaccessible due to high entry barriers. US Treasurys, being one of the most secure and liquid assets, serve as an ideal candidate for this transition to a tokenized format.

The growth of tokenized RWAs is significant not only for investors seeking diversification and yield but also for the entire financial ecosystem. It represents a shift toward digital finance, where assets can be easily traded, managed, and utilized in various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. As more traditional financial instruments become tokenized, it is expected to lead to increased engagement from both institutional and retail investors.

## From author

The ongoing trend of tokenization in financial markets marks a critical evolution in how assets are perceived and managed. The reported increase of 229% in the tokenization of RWAs, particularly US Treasurys, underscores a growing acceptance and integration of blockchain technology within traditional finance. This shift not only enhances the liquidity of assets but also democratizes access, allowing a broader range of investors to participate in markets that were once limited to institutional players. 

The anticipated continued demand for dollar-yield assets into 2026 suggests that the momentum behind tokenization is not a fleeting trend but rather a foundational change in asset management strategies. As this market matures, it will be essential to observe how regulatory frameworks evolve to accommodate these innovations and protect investors.
