## Overview

Tether Holdings SA, a prominent stablecoin issuer, is currently seeking to raise up to $20 billion through a stock sale. In a strategic move, the company has intervened to prevent certain existing shareholders from selling their stakes, while also exploring methods to provide liquidity for investors.

## Tether's Strategic Moves
