## Overview

Solana has been recognized as the most popular blockchain ecosystem of 2025 for the second consecutive year, according to a report by CoinGecko. Despite this achievement, the ecosystem experienced a notable decline in global interest compared to the previous year, reflecting challenges in expanding its narrative beyond meme coin speculation.

## Solana's Popularity and Rankings

On Monday, CoinGecko announced that Solana secured its position as the leading blockchain ecosystem based on popularity for 2025. The report analyzed blockchain ecosystems through non-botted global web traffic from January 1 to December 14, 2025. It focused on ecosystems with actively listed coins and those that had a non-zero percentage share of traffic, including a total of 62 blockchain ecosystems in the study.

The findings revealed that the top 20 ecosystems accounted for 95.60% of global interest in chain-specific narratives. Solana captured 26.79% of this interest, retaining its title from the previous year. Following Solana, the Base ecosystem ranked second with 13.94% of global interest, although it experienced a decline of 2.9% from its 2024 figure of 16.81%. Ethereum maintained its third-place position, accounting for 13.43% of global interest.

In addition to Solana, Base, and Ethereum, the Sui and BNB Chain ecosystems showed significant growth, moving up the rankings to fourth and fifth place, respectively. The Sui ecosystem achieved the largest growth, increasing its mindshare by 6.9% year-over-year to reach 11.77% of global interest. Meanwhile, BNB Chain saw a 4.9% increase, reaching 9.05% in mindshare, largely attributed to the launch of Binance Alpha in May, which boosted its on-chain trading volumes.

## Declining Interest in Solana's Narratives

Despite leading the popularity rankings, Solana's overall mindshare decreased considerably from 38.79% in 2024 to 26.79% in 2025. The decline reflects Solana's struggle to diversify its narrative beyond its association with meme coin speculation. The report noted that Solana's price has remained stagnant, despite a broader institutional adoption marked by the launch of US ETFs.

This year, the Solana ecosystem fell out of the top narratives list, previously ranking within the top five for two years. The memecoin category emerged as the most popular crypto narrative in 2025, capturing 25.02% of global investor interest, although this was a decrease from 30.67% in 2024. Solana's memecoin sector similarly dropped out of the top five narratives due to a 3.08% decline in global interest.

CoinGecko's analysis suggests that the enthusiasm for purely speculative crypto assets may be waning. The Solana narrative's ability to regain traction in the coming year remains uncertain, as momentum from its past success appears to be diminishing.

## From author

The report underscores the dynamic nature of blockchain ecosystems and the shifting interests of investors. While Solana's popularity remains notable, the decline in its mindshare raises questions about its future trajectory. The blockchain space is continuously evolving, and the results indicate that ecosystems must adapt to maintain relevance and interest.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Solana retains its title as the most popular blockchain ecosystem, but faces challenges in maintaining interest.
- The decline in Solana's mindshare highlights a potential shift in investor focus away from meme coins.
- Base and Ethereum continue to hold strong positions, indicating a competitive landscape among top ecosystems.
- The rise of Sui and BNB Chain suggests emerging narratives that may influence investor interest in the future.
- The overall decline in the memecoin narrative points to a potential cooling off in speculative crypto investments.
