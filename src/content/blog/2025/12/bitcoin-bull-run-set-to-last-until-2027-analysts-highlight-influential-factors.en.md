## Overview

Recent discussions within the cryptocurrency community have suggested a shift in the understanding of Bitcoin's market cycles. Analysts from the Bull Theory propose that while the traditional four-year cycle may be diminishing in relevance, the ongoing Bitcoin bull run could persist until 2027. This perspective is grounded in various economic and liquidity factors impacting the market.

## The Evolving Market Cycle

The Bull Theory analysts assert that the idea of Bitcoin following a strict four-year cycle is losing traction. They argue that significant price fluctuations in the past decade were not solely the result of Halving events but were also heavily influenced by changes in global liquidity. Currently, the landscape of stablecoin liquidity remains elevated, even amid recent market downturns, suggesting that larger investors continue to monitor the market for favorable macroeconomic conditions.

### Treasury Policies and Market Liquidity

In the United States, Treasury policies are emerging as crucial elements affecting market dynamics. The analysts point out that while recent Treasury buybacks are noteworthy, the key factor is the balance of the Treasury General Account (TGA), which is substantially above its normal range. This surplus cash is expected to reintegrate into the financial system, improving financing conditions and increasing liquidity, which often gravitates toward risk assets such as Bitcoin.

### Global Economic Trends

The global economic landscape also presents optimistic trends. China has been actively injecting liquidity for several months, and Japan has announced a significant stimulus package, along with efforts to simplify cryptocurrency regulations. Additionally, Canada is moving towards easing its monetary policies, and the US Federal Reserve has paused its quantitative tightening measures, which historically precede liquidity expansion.

## Political and Monetary Factors

The alignment of political and monetary factors is creating a conducive environment for Bitcoin's growth. When major economies implement expansive monetary policies simultaneously, risk assets like Bitcoin tend to respond more swiftly than traditional stocks. The potential reintroduction of policy tools, such as the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption, could further enhance credit creation and liquidity in the market.

Political discussions also play a role, with proposals for tax reforms and the possibility of a new Federal Reserve chair who may favor liquidity assistance and a positive stance toward cryptocurrency. 

## Extended Bitcoin Uptrend

Historically, periods when the Institute for Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (ISM PMI) exceeds a certain threshold have been followed by altcoin season. The analysts believe that the likelihood of this trend occurring in the coming years is substantial. 

The convergence of rising stablecoin liquidity, Treasury cash injections, global quantitative easing, and potential easing of bank lending restrictions indicates a departure from the traditional four-year halving model. The analysts conclude that if liquidity expands concurrently across major economies, Bitcoin is unlikely to resist that trend, suggesting a prolonged bull run rather than a sharp rally followed by a bear market.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- The perception of Bitcoin's four-year cycle is shifting, potentially altering investment strategies.
- Increased stablecoin liquidity suggests continued interest from larger investors.
- U.S. Treasury policies could enhance market liquidity, supporting risk assets.
- Global monetary easing may create favorable conditions for cryptocurrency growth.
- Political developments may further bolster economic growth and support for cryptocurrencies.
- The likelihood of an extended Bitcoin uptrend could reshape market dynamics moving into 2026 and 2027.
