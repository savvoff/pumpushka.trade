Several industry figures echoed Arrington's mixed asset allocation. Notably, Tony Edward mentioned XRP in conjunction with Bitcoin and Ethereum when discussing key positions in the cryptocurrency market. The conversation surrounding Arrington's post was dynamic, with some users interpreting his investment choices as a sign of confidence in XRP, while others cautioned against overemphasizing the impact of one individual investor's preferences on the broader market.

Arrington's endorsement of XRP is linked to recent institutional activities. In October, Arrington Capital collaborated with Ripple and SBI Holdings to support an initiative by Evernorth. This initiative aims to establish a significant institutional treasury for XRP, which has been described as one of the largest of its kind. The project is designed to enhance institutional adoption of XRP and promote on-ledger activities, such as decentralized finance and lending.

This partnership underscores the growing interest in XRP among institutional investors and the efforts to integrate the token into broader financial frameworks.

A slight daily increase of about 1.2% brought the token to around $2.08, helping it recover from earlier weaknesses observed in December. Throughout the year, XRP experienced notable volatility, peaking at around $3.65 in July before experiencing a decline.

Moreover, interest in regulated derivatives has surged, with reports indicating that XRP futures on the CME reached a record open interest of approximately $3 billion in late October 2025. This figure is viewed as a reflection of the increasing institutional demand for regulated exposure to XRP.
