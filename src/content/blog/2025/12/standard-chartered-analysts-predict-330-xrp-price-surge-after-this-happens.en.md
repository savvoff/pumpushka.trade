## Overview

Standard Chartered analysts have made a bold prediction regarding the future price of XRP, suggesting a potential surge of around 330%. This forecast is contingent on several catalysts that could propel the price to a new all-time high, indicating a significant shift in the market dynamics surrounding the Ripple-linked token.

## Predicted Surge and Catalysts

According to Geoff Hendrick, the global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, the XRP price could rise to $8 by the end of 2026. This increase would represent a 330% growth from its previous all-time high of approximately $3.84. The analysts believe that the recent legal clarity following the settlement of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit is a primary factor that could facilitate this price surge.

Hendrick also pointed out that the regulatory environment for the U.S. crypto industry is improving, which is expected to encourage institutional adoption of XRP, particularly through XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The favorable regulatory landscape has made it easier for institutions to gain exposure to XRP, further enhancing its growth potential.

Ripple has been expanding its payment system, which utilizes XRP, in alignment with this regulatory-friendly environment. The XRP ETFs are reportedly experiencing significant demand, which analysts view as a bullish signal for the token's price trajectory.

Recent data indicates that these ETFs have not recorded a daily net outflow since the launch of the first spot fund, and they currently hold a net asset value of $1.27 billion, representing a small percentage of XRP's market capitalization. Additionally, a crypto pundit highlighted that the rapid absorption of supply by these ETFs could lead to a supply shock by early 2026, potentially driving the XRP price higher.

## Technical Analysis and Market Sentiment

In terms of technical analysis, the XRP price is approaching a critical level around $1.88, indicating a potential breakout. Analyst TARA has noted that XRP needs to maintain support at $1.87 while Bitcoin trends upward. If XRP can bounce from this level and test $1.88 again, a successful breakout could occur, which would be interpreted as a bullish sign for the asset.

Furthermore, TARA mentioned that XRP's Relative Strength Index (RSI) is attempting to break to the upside. If XRP closes above $1.88, it could trigger the next wave of momentum, potentially leading the price towards $2.30. Supporting this optimistic outlook, data from Glassnode shows that the amount of XRP on exchanges has decreased to a seven-year low, indicating reduced selling pressure.

## From author

The predictions and analyses provided by Standard Chartered and other analysts highlight the evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market, particularly for XRP. With regulatory clarity and institutional interest on the rise, the potential for significant price movements appears to be increasing. The interplay between market sentiment and technical indicators will be crucial in determining the next steps for XRP.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Increased regulatory clarity could foster greater institutional participation in the crypto market.
- The potential for XRP ETFs to absorb supply may lead to upward price pressure.
- The prediction of a price surge could attract speculative investment and shift market sentiment.
- A successful breakout above key resistance levels may signal a broader bullish trend for altcoins.
- The declining supply of XRP on exchanges may indicate strong buying interest, contributing to price stability or growth.
