## Overview

As the first crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) targeting Bitcoin and Ethereum approach their second anniversary in the United States, Galaxy Digital has released projections that suggest substantial growth in inflows. The firm anticipates that net inflows into US spot crypto ETFs will surpass $50 billion in 2026, reflecting increasing institutional adoption and a wave of new product launches.

## Projected Inflows for 2026

In its 2026 forecast report, Galaxy Digital emphasizes the potential for significant net inflows into US spot crypto ETFs, predicting that these inflows will exceed $50 billion. This projection follows a successful year in 2025, which saw net inflows reach $23 billion. The firm attributes this optimistic outlook to the anticipated acceleration of institutional adoption, driven by various factors including wirehouses lifting restrictions on advisor recommendations and Vanguard’s plans to introduce crypto funds.

The report highlights that Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds are expected to lead this growth, with inflows predicted to surpass those seen in 2025. Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Galaxy Digital notes an anticipated increase in new crypto ETFs, especially those focusing on spot altcoin products.

## Expansion of Crypto ETFs

Galaxy Digital forecasts that over 100 new crypto ETFs will enter the market, comprising more than 50 spot altcoin ETFs and another 50 that do not concentrate on single coins. The expectation for increased momentum in spot altcoin ETF launches is attributed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission's recent approval of generic listing standards. In 2025, the launch of over 15 spot crypto ETFs for various altcoins marked a significant development, featuring assets such as Solana, XRP, Hedera, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Chainlink.

The firm also anticipates that several notable assets that have yet to file for their spot ETFs will soon join the market. In addition to single-asset products, Galaxy Digital expects the introduction of multi-asset ETFs and leveraged crypto ETFs, further diversifying the offerings available to investors.

## IPO Prospects for Crypto Companies

In addition to the growth of crypto ETFs, Galaxy Digital predicts that more than 15 cryptocurrency companies will seek initial public offerings (IPOs) or uplist in the United States. Over the past year, 10 crypto-related firms, including Galaxy Digital, have successfully gone public or uplisted. The firm notes that over 290 crypto and blockchain companies have completed significant private funding rounds since 2018, positioning them favorably for US listings as regulatory conditions improve.

Potential candidates for IPOs or uplisting in 2026 include firms such as CoinShares, BitGo, Chainalysis, and FalconX. The increasing number of companies seeking public listings reflects a growing confidence in the market and its regulatory landscape.

## From author

The predictions from Galaxy Digital underscore a pivotal moment in the crypto market as institutional adoption continues to rise. The anticipated influx of capital into crypto ETFs and the potential for more companies to go public signify an evolving landscape that could reshape the investment paradigm within the digital asset space. 

## Impact on the crypto market

- Anticipated inflows of over $50 billion into US spot crypto ETFs could significantly enhance market liquidity.
- The introduction of new crypto ETFs, especially for altcoins, may broaden investor access and diversify investment portfolios.
- Increased institutional interest may lead to greater stability and acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance.
- The potential for over 15 cryptocurrency companies to pursue IPOs could attract additional investment and enhance the credibility of the crypto sector.
- The regulatory environment appears to be improving, fostering a more conducive atmosphere for crypto-related financial products and services.
