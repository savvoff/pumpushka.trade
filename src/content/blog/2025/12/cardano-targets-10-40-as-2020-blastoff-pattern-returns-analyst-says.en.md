## Overview

Cardano (ADA) is experiencing a renewed sense of optimism as technical analyst Quantum Ascend suggests that the cryptocurrency is mirroring a pattern reminiscent of its substantial price increase in 2020. In a recent analysis, he outlines potential price targets and the structural analysis behind them, indicating a bullish outlook for ADA's future.

## Analysis of the Current Situation

Quantum Ascend, a technical analyst active on X, recently shared insights regarding Cardano's price trajectory, suggesting that the asset is entering a phase similar to its "2020 blastoff." He notes that his analysis is based on a longer-term weekly count and believes that the market is nearing the conclusion of a prolonged corrective phase. His analysis proposes a conservative target range between two price levels and a more ambitious target for a potential future bull run.

The analyst describes the current market structure not as a straightforward five-wave impulse but rather as a complex, time-based macro correction. He identifies a developing triangle structure on the weekly chart, which he believes is indicative of the next phase in ADA's price movement. Quantum Ascend emphasizes the importance of confluence in his analysis, highlighting price zones where various technical indicators converge.

One of the key references in his analysis is a previous A-to-B drawdown range, which he believes has not yet fully "closed out." He identifies a significant level around a specific price point that aligns with his bullish perspective. Furthermore, he discusses an upper trendline from a C-to-D drawdown that intersects with a Fibonacci extension, adding further weight to his bullish targets.

Quantum Ascend also makes a relative-performance comparison between Cardano and Ethereum Classic, suggesting that if ADA follows a similar trajectory, it could reach a substantial price point. Despite the ambitious targets, he maintains a focus on a near-term target that he considers "safe," reiterating the importance of the $5 region as a significant level of confluence.

Throughout his analysis, he draws parallels between the current price action and previous movements in ADA's history, suggesting that these similarities indicate a potential upcoming breakout. Additionally, he offers a broader macro perspective, expressing a belief that corrections across various markets are nearing their conclusion, which could set the stage for a final push in both crypto and stock markets.

## From author

The insights provided by Quantum Ascend highlight the complexities involved in technical analysis, particularly in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. His focus on confluence and structural patterns underscores the importance of understanding market dynamics rather than relying solely on numerical predictions. The comparison to past price movements in Cardano's history serves as a reminder of the cyclical nature of markets and the potential for significant price movements based on historical patterns.
