## Overview

At Binance Blockchain Week, Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy, highlighted a significant shift in the stance of major U.S. banks towards Bitcoin. He observed that the skepticism surrounding cryptocurrency within these financial institutions is diminishing more rapidly than previously anticipated.

## Banking Giants Reverse Course

Saylor noted that over the past year, prominent banks such as Citibank, BNY, Bank of America, PNC, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Vanguard have transitioned from a position of hostility to one that is increasingly accommodating toward cryptocurrency. This change is particularly significant given the historical reluctance of these institutions to engage with digital assets. For instance, Vanguard has begun allowing clients to trade exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares linked to both XRP and Bitcoin, signaling a more integrated approach to crypto within traditional finance.

Additionally, Saylor mentioned that several banks are actively working on plans to introduce custody services and credit lines that are tied to cryptocurrency holdings. This move represents a notable evolution in the banking sector's approach to digital assets, as it reflects a willingness to accommodate the growing demand for crypto-related financial services.

## Loans Backed By Bitcoin

In a further demonstration of this shift, Saylor indicated that Charles Schwab is preparing to offer Bitcoin custody services and plans to extend credit against Bitcoin as collateral in the near future. Citibank is reportedly pursuing a similar strategy. Saylor reflected on the previous challenges he faced when trying to secure bank loans using Bitcoin as collateral, noting that lenders have rapidly changed their stance within a mere six months. According to his observations, eight of the top ten banks in the United States are now issuing loans backed by Bitcoin, underscoring the swift transformation in attitudes within the banking industry.

## Political Climate Could Be Speeding Things Up

Saylor attributed some of this rapid change to the shifting political landscape under U.S. President Donald Trump, which has reportedly fostered an environment more conducive to banking engagement with cryptocurrencies. While many banks had begun experimenting with blockchain technology years prior—Goldman Sachs, for instance, issued one of the first Bitcoin-backed loans in 2022—the more favorable regulatory climate has spurred banks to accelerate their planning and product development in the crypto space. However, Saylor cautioned that these banks still face significant legal, operational, and risk-related challenges before they can offer these services to a broad retail audience.

## Markets Watching Fed Announcement

In the backdrop of these developments, traders and analysts are closely monitoring the Federal Open Market Committee's announcements. The Fed is anticipated to cut interest rates, a move that often positively influences risk assets such as Bitcoin. This potential change could lead to increased market volatility, with some players warning that initial rallies may reverse quickly depending on the Fed's forward guidance.

## From author

The recent dialogue surrounding the evolving relationship between major banks and Bitcoin reveals a pivotal moment in the financial landscape. The rapid acceptance of Bitcoin-backed loans and custody services indicates that traditional finance is beginning to recognize the legitimacy and potential of cryptocurrencies. This transformation, driven by both market demand and a more favorable regulatory environment, could reshape the way banking operates in relation to digital assets.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Major U.S. banks are increasingly adopting Bitcoin-backed loan services, which could enhance liquidity in the crypto market.
- The shift in attitude from skepticism to acceptance among banks may attract more institutional investment into cryptocurrencies.
- Regulatory changes under the current administration are promoting innovation and product development in the crypto sector.
- Potential interest rate cuts by the Fed could lead to increased investment in risk assets, including Bitcoin.
- The introduction of custody services and credit lines by banks may facilitate broader retail participation in cryptocurrency markets.
