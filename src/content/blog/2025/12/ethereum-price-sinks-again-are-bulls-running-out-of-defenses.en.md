## Overview

Ethereum's price has faced significant downward pressure, failing to maintain levels above $2,950 and entering a bearish zone. The cryptocurrency is currently consolidating its losses, and its future movements depend on whether it can break through key resistance levels.

## Recent Price Movement

Ethereum's price recently attempted to increase but encountered difficulties above the $2,950 mark. This struggle led to a decline below the $2,920 and $2,900 thresholds, ultimately entering a bearish zone. The price dipped further, reaching a low of $2,775. Currently, Ethereum is consolidating near this low level, which is close to the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the decline from a previous swing high of $2,993 to the low of $2,775.

At present, Ethereum is trading below $2,870 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, indicating a lack of bullish momentum. There is also a bearish trend line forming, with resistance noted at $2,925 on the hourly chart for ETH/USD. If Ethereum can manage another upward move, it may face resistance near $2,850, followed by further resistance at the $2,880 level, which coincides with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward movement.

Should Ethereum clear the $2,925 resistance, the price could potentially rise towards the $3,000 resistance level. A breakthrough above the $3,000 region may signal further gains in the days ahead, with speculative targets suggesting a rise towards the $3,080 or even $3,120 resistance zones.

## Potential Downside Risks

On the other hand, if Ethereum fails to breach the $2,850 resistance, it may initiate a new decline. Initial support is identified near the $2,800 level, with major support at the $2,775 zone. A significant drop below this support level could push the price down towards $2,720. Continued bearish momentum might lead Ethereum to test the $2,640 region, with the next key support level sitting at $2,620.

### Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for ETH/USD is currently losing momentum within the bearish zone, suggesting a weakening bearish trend.
  
- **Hourly RSI**: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for ETH/USD is below the 50 level, reinforcing the bearish sentiment.

- **Major Support Level**: $2,775

- **Major Resistance Level**: $2,880

Ethereum's current price action highlights the ongoing challenges faced by the cryptocurrency in maintaining upward momentum. With bears exerting pressure, the critical resistance and support levels will play a significant role in determining the direction of ETH's price in the near term. Traders and investors will closely monitor these levels for potential signals of recovery or further declines.
