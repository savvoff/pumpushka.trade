## Overview

The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn, with major cryptocurrencies reversing last week's gains. This decline was marked by over $650 million in liquidations, particularly affecting long positions as Bitcoin dipped below a critical threshold. Additionally, China's central bank reaffirmed its stance on the illegality of cryptocurrency, contributing to market volatility.

## Market Movements

Cryptocurrency majors experienced a sharp decline, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling by 6% to $85,800 and Ethereum (ETH) also down 6% to $2,820. Binance Coin (BNB) saw a 7% decrease, landing at $822, while Solana (SOL) dropped 7% to $127. Among the few tokens that showed positive movement, MYX led with a 15% increase, followed by JST with a 4% rise.

The market faced significant liquidations, totaling over $650 million within a single day. This included around $580 million in long positions that were liquidated as Bitcoin's price fell below $86,000. Zcash (ZEC) suffered the most substantial loss among major tokens, plummeting 20% to $355, marking a 35% decrease over the week.

In the context of regulatory news, China's central bank reiterated that cryptocurrency remains illegal, indicating a forthcoming crackdown on crypto activities in the country. This announcement added to the existing uncertainty in the market.

## Industry Developments

In other significant industry news, Tether's founder addressed ongoing concerns regarding the company's financial stability, emphasizing that Tether is not at risk of insolvency. Furthermore, Robinhood announced a partnership with Susquehanna to establish a new CFTC-licensed exchange, which aims to expand into prediction markets. Pavel Durov also introduced Cocoon, a decentralized confidential compute network designed to reward GPU operators with TON tokens.

Additionally, JPMorgan made headlines with the introduction of a new structured product linked to Bitcoin. This product offers investors a minimum yield of 16%, potentially increasing up to 50% based on Bitcoin's performance, while providing downside protection of up to 30%.
