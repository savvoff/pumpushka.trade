This influx of capital suggests a shift in investor sentiment, as bearish bets appear to be declining. Meanwhile, interest in XRP funds remains robust, indicating a dynamic environment within the cryptocurrency market.

## Bitcoin ETFs See Significant Inflow

In a notable development, Bitcoin ETFs have captured $352 million. This influx of investment is particularly significant as it coincides with a retreat of bearish bets in the market.

This trend is significant as it highlights the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investments, with ETFs providing a more accessible avenue for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin.

The ongoing popularity of XRP indicates that there is a segment of the market that remains enthusiastic about alternative cryptocurrencies, despite the fluctuations in the broader market. This sustained interest in XRP funds showcases the diversity of investor strategies within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
