## Overview

StableChain has officially launched its mainnet, introducing a network that utilizes USDT for transaction gas fees and features a dedicated governance token. The launch has garnered support from various stakeholders, including Bitfinex, Hack VC, Tether executives, and several other investors, following a successful seed funding round amounting to $28 million.

## What Happened

StableChain's mainnet launch marks a significant development in the blockchain ecosystem, particularly for users and developers looking for stablecoin solutions. The decision to use USDT as the currency for gas fees highlights the increasing integration of stablecoins within blockchain networks. This strategic choice allows for stabilized transaction costs, which can be especially appealing in the often volatile cryptocurrency market.

The backing from prominent players such as Bitfinex and Tether executives signals strong confidence in the project. Their involvement not only adds credibility to StableChain but also suggests that there may be substantial resources and expertise available to support its growth and adoption. The inclusion of Hack VC and other investors further emphasizes the project's potential to attract interest and investment from various sectors within the crypto industry.

The dedicated governance token introduced alongside the mainnet is designed to empower users in decision-making processes related to the network. Governance tokens have become a crucial element in decentralized finance (DeFi), allowing holders to vote on proposals and changes within the ecosystem. This aspect is particularly important for fostering community engagement and ensuring that the network evolves in a manner that aligns with user interests.

The $28 million seed round indicates a robust initial financial backing, which can be pivotal for the project's development and operational sustainability. Such funding can facilitate the enhancement of network features, security measures, and user acquisition strategies, all of which are vital for a successful launch and long-term viability.
