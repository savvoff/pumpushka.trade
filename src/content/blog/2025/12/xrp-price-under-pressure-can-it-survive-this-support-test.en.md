## Overview

XRP has entered a phase of decline, breaking below critical support levels and struggling to regain upward momentum. The cryptocurrency is now facing significant resistance, which poses challenges for any potential recovery.

## Recent Price Movements

XRP's price has recently fallen below $2.10, marking the start of a new downward trend. The cryptocurrency is currently grappling with resistance at the $2.050 pivot level. Following this decline, XRP's price has dipped below the $2.040 zone and is trading under $2.020, as well as below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A bearish trend line has formed, indicating resistance at $2.050 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.

The situation worsened when XRP attempted to rally above $2.120 but could not maintain its upward trajectory, similar to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This inability to sustain gains led to a further decline, and XRP has now settled below the $2.00 support level. A low was recorded at $1.993, with the price consolidating losses beneath the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, which reflects the downward movement from the $2.177 swing high to the $1.993 low.

Currently, XRP is trading below the resistance levels of $2.050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If an upward movement occurs, resistance is anticipated near the $2.0350 level, with the primary resistance still at $2.050. A close above this level could potentially lead XRP toward $2.085 and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the earlier decline. However, the next significant hurdle for upward movement is identified at the $2.10 mark.

If XRP fails to overcome the $2.050 resistance, it may initiate a new decline. The initial support level on the downside is positioned around $2.00, with a subsequent major support near $1.9850. A breakdown and close below this latter level could lead to further declines, potentially targeting $1.920 and lower levels, including $1.880 and $1.820.

## Technical Analysis

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD indicator for XRP/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone, suggesting a continued downward trend.
