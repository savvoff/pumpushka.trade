## Overview

Ethereum has activated the Fusaka upgrade, which introduces a significant improvement in the way data is processed within its network. This upgrade is designed to reduce the costs associated with node operations and enhance the speed of layer-2 settlements.

## Details of the Fusaka Upgrade

The key feature of the Fusaka upgrade is the implementation of PeerDAS. This innovative system allows validators to check smaller portions of data instead of having to process entire "blobs." By doing so, it aims to decrease both the costs incurred by validators and the computational load placed on them. This change is particularly relevant for layer-2 networks, which rely on efficient data handling to function optimally.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The Fusaka upgrade is expected to lower operational costs for validators, potentially attracting more participants to the Ethereum network.
- Enhanced efficiency in data processing may lead to faster transactions and settlements on layer-2 solutions.
- The introduction of PeerDAS could influence the development of future upgrades and improvements within the Ethereum ecosystem.
- Improved performance and reduced costs may strengthen Ethereum's position in the competitive landscape of blockchain networks.
- This upgrade could also enhance user experience by promoting quicker and more cost-effective transactions on the Ethereum platform.
