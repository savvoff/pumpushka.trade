## Overview

Bitcoin has recently dipped below its 'fair value' for the first time in two years. This situation has prompted discussions regarding potential future gains based on historical trends.

## What Happened

Bitcoin experienced a significant price movement, falling below what is considered its 'fair value.' This marks a notable event as it is the first occurrence of this kind in a two-year span. Following this dip, a network reset was completed, which included the flushing of leverage and accumulation by long-term holders. Subsequently, the price of Bitcoin has rebounded and is now back above its fair value.

## Why It Matters

The implications of Bitcoin's dip below fair value are significant for the cryptocurrency market. A network reset often indicates a shift in market dynamics, and the accumulation by long-term holders suggests confidence in Bitcoin's future performance. The recovery back above fair value indicates a stabilization phase, which could influence investor sentiment and market strategies moving forward.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The dip below fair value may attract attention from investors looking for potential buying opportunities.
- The flushing of leverage could lead to a healthier market environment, reducing volatility.
- Long-term holder accumulation suggests a strong belief in Bitcoin's long-term value.
- The recovery above fair value could signal renewed confidence in the market.
- Historical trends indicate that such price movements may lead to significant gains in the following months.
