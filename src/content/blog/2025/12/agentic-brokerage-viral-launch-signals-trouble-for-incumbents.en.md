## Overview

The recent announcement by Public regarding its agentic brokerage has led to a significant influx of customers from established financial institutions like Schwab and Fidelity. This shift highlights the changing landscape of the brokerage industry, where traditional switching costs are diminishing due to advancements in artificial intelligence.

## What Happened

Public's introduction of its agentic brokerage service has resonated with consumers, prompting a noticeable migration of clients from long-standing players such as Schwab and Fidelity. Traditionally, customers faced considerable barriers when considering a switch from one brokerage to another, including complex processes, fees, and a general reluctance to change financial institutions. However, the emergence of AI technologies is rapidly breaking down these barriers.

The AI-driven features of Public's brokerage platform appear to be particularly appealing to customers, offering enhanced services and streamlined experiences that challenge the status quo. This technological advancement not only provides a competitive edge for Public but also signifies a broader trend in the financial services sector. As consumers become more accustomed to digital innovations, their expectations for brokerage services have evolved, leading them to seek out firms that leverage technology effectively.

This shift is particularly significant as it underscores a potential vulnerability for traditional brokerage firms. The established players may find it increasingly difficult to retain their client base if they are unable to adapt to the changing demands of consumers. The erosion of switching costs, facilitated by AI advancements, means that customers can more easily explore alternative options that better meet their needs.

## From author

The implications of Public's agentic brokerage announcement extend beyond just client acquisition. It raises questions about the future viability of traditional brokerage models in an increasingly competitive and tech-driven landscape. As firms like Public capitalize on innovations, it prompts a reevaluation of how incumbents must respond to remain relevant.

Furthermore, the rapid adaptation to AI technologies among newer firms could set a precedent for how financial services evolve. The focus on user experience, efficiency, and personalized services is becoming paramount, and those who fail to recognize this shift may find themselves struggling to keep pace. The brokerage industry is entering a new era where customer loyalty is no longer guaranteed and is contingent upon the ability to innovate.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The influx of customers to Public may indicate a growing preference for tech-savvy platforms in financial services, including crypto trading.
- As traditional brokerage firms face increased competition, they might be compelled to enhance their offerings in crypto services to retain clients.
- The trend towards AI-driven platforms could lead to more innovative solutions in the crypto space, potentially attracting a broader audience.
- A shift in customer allegiance from established firms to newer entrants may influence market dynamics and trading volumes in the crypto sector.
- The erosion of switching costs could encourage more investors to explore crypto markets, impacting liquidity and market behavior.
