## Overview

Cascade has launched a new trading platform, introducing a 24/7 neo-brokerage offering that enables retail traders to engage in perpetual trading across cryptocurrencies and U.S. stocks. This development is significant as it allows users to utilize a single margin account for continuous trading, presenting a more accessible and streamlined approach to market participation.

## What Happened

Cascade's innovative platform is designed to provide retail traders with the ability to trade in perpetual markets around the clock. This means that traders can engage with both cryptocurrency and U.S. stock markets at any time, enhancing their trading flexibility. By allowing the use of one margin account, Cascade aims to simplify the trading process and reduce the complexity often associated with managing multiple accounts across different assets.

Perpetual contracts are a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the price movements of an asset without an expiration date. This characteristic is particularly appealing in the volatile cryptocurrency market, where prices can fluctuate significantly within short periods. The introduction of this neo-brokerage model by Cascade represents a shift in how retail traders can approach their investments, potentially leading to increased market participation.

The decision to include both cryptocurrencies and U.S. stocks in this offering reflects a growing trend in the financial markets, where traditional assets and digital currencies are increasingly being integrated. This convergence could attract a wider range of investors, from those who are more familiar with traditional stock trading to those who are more inclined towards cryptocurrencies.

## From author

The launch of Cascade's 24/7 neo-brokerage offering marks a notable advancement in the accessibility of trading for retail investors. By combining perpetual trading of cryptocurrencies and U.S. stocks into a single platform, Cascade is addressing a critical need for flexibility and ease of use in trading. The ability to operate through one margin account simplifies the trading process and may encourage more individuals to enter the market.

This initiative could also have implications for the competitive landscape of trading platforms. As more companies explore similar offerings, it will be interesting to observe how this affects user engagement and market dynamics. The integration of traditional and digital assets in a single trading environment could potentially reshape the way investors approach their portfolios.
