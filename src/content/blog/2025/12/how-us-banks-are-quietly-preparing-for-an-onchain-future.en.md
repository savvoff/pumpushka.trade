## Overview

US banks are undergoing significant changes to their core financial infrastructure, focusing on the integration of on-chain capabilities. This effort aims to enable the movement of cash, custody, and funds in a regulated environment, highlighting the banking sector's adaptation to the evolving landscape of digital finance.

## What Happened

Recent developments indicate that US banks are actively working to enhance their financial systems to accommodate on-chain transactions. This initiative involves a comprehensive overhaul of existing infrastructure, allowing for a seamless transition of traditional banking operations into the digital realm. The banks are strategically positioning themselves to facilitate transactions that utilize blockchain technology, which is increasingly becoming a pivotal aspect of financial services.

The primary motivation behind this transformation is the growing recognition of the potential benefits that on-chain operations can offer. By enabling cash, custody, and funds to move on-chain, banks are not only improving efficiency but also meeting the demands of a market that is shifting towards more transparent and secure transaction methods.

Moreover, this move is taking place under the umbrella of regulatory oversight, ensuring that the banks remain compliant with existing financial regulations. This is crucial, as regulatory frameworks continue to evolve in response to the rise of digital assets and blockchain technology. By proactively adapting their infrastructure, US banks aim to maintain their relevance and competitive edge in a rapidly changing financial landscape.
