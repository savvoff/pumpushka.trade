## Overview

Securitize has announced its plans to introduce a pioneering platform for fully on-chain trading of real public stocks, set to launch in early 2026. This innovative approach aims to revolutionize the way shares are issued and traded, emphasizing legal ownership and shareholder rights.

## What Happened

Securitize's forthcoming platform will enable shares to be issued and recorded on-chain, ensuring that all transactions are transparent and verifiable. This development marks a significant step forward in the integration of blockchain technology within traditional finance, as it provides a new method for investors to engage with public stocks.

The platform is designed to offer full legal ownership of shares, which means that investors will have documented proof of their ownership rights directly linked to the blockchain. This feature is essential, as it not only enhances the security of ownership but also simplifies the process of transferring shares among investors. The implementation of self-custody further empowers shareholders, allowing them to maintain control over their assets without relying on third-party custodians.

The introduction of this platform is particularly noteworthy because it combines the benefits of blockchain technology with the established framework of public stock trading. By leveraging the advantages of on-chain transactions, Securitize aims to increase efficiency in trading and reduce costs associated with traditional stock exchanges.

## From author

This move by Securitize is indicative of a broader trend within the financial sector, where traditional practices are increasingly being challenged and redefined by innovative technologies. The ability to trade public stocks on a blockchain platform could potentially reshape investor experiences and the overall market structure. By providing legal ownership and self-custody, Securitize addresses some of the long-standing concerns associated with stock ownership, such as transparency and security.

As more companies explore blockchain solutions, the implications for regulatory frameworks and investor protections will also need to be considered. The success of Securitize's platform could serve as a case study for future integrations of blockchain in traditional finance, potentially paving the way for more widespread adoption.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The introduction of on-chain trading for public stocks may attract a new demographic of investors, including those who are already familiar with cryptocurrency.
- Enhanced transparency and security could lead to increased trust in blockchain technologies within the financial sector.
- The model set by Securitize may inspire other companies to explore similar integrations of blockchain in their operations.
- The ability to self-custody shares could shift the dynamics of asset management and ownership, influencing how investors approach their portfolios.
- Regulatory responses may emerge as governments and financial authorities assess the implications of on-chain trading for public stocks.
