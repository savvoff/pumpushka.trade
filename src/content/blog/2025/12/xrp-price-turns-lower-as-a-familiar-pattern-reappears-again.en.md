## Overview

XRP's price has recently faced challenges as it struggled to maintain upward momentum after failing to surpass the $1.920 mark. This decline follows a series of bearish movements, leading to significant resistance levels and the potential for further declines. 

## Price Movement and Current Situation

XRP's price initially attempted to recover above the $1.90 threshold but could not sustain this upward trajectory. It subsequently fell below key support levels, including $1.880 and $1.850, marking a new weekly low at $1.7707. The price is now trading beneath the $1.850 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, indicating a bearish sentiment among traders.

A bearish trend line is currently forming, with resistance identified at $1.920 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. If the price settles below $1.780, it may continue to decline. The price is also showing bearish signs as it trades below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward move from the recent swing high to the low at $1.7707.

In the event of a potential recovery, resistance is anticipated near the $1.810 level. More significant resistance lies at $1.8520, which corresponds to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward move from the swing high to the recent low. If XRP manages to close above this resistance, it could potentially rise toward $1.880. 

However, the next major hurdle for the price is still at $1.920, where the bearish trend line also lies. A decisive move above this resistance could open the path toward $1.9650, and further gains might lead to a test of the $2.00 resistance. The bulls would need to overcome the $2.050 level to establish a stronger upward trend.

Conversely, if XRP fails to breach the $1.8520 resistance zone, it may begin a fresh decline. Initial support is observed near the $1.780 level, with a more significant support level at $1.7620. Should the price break below this level and close beneath it, further declines toward $1.720 and potentially $1.680 could occur.
