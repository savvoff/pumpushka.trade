## Overview

Hashdex has released its 2026 crypto investment outlook, emphasizing a shift in how investors should approach cryptocurrency. The firm advocates for treating crypto not as a speculative asset but as a legitimate allocation within investment portfolios. This perspective comes in light of changing macroeconomic conditions, highlighting the growing significance of cryptocurrencies in the broader financial landscape.

## Key Insights from Hashdex

Hashdex's Chief Investment Officer, Samir Kerbage, argues that most investors should consider allocating approximately 5–10% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies. This recommendation is a response to a complex macroeconomic environment characterized by persistent inflation risks and rising debt burdens. The traditional 60/40 portfolio model is increasingly seen as outdated, leading to a recognition that a minimal allocation to crypto is a conscious decision to underweight a growing asset class.

The firm's analysis indicates that the crypto market cap has surpassed $3 trillion, representing about 1% of the global investable market. Allocating less than 1% to this asset class is framed as a deliberate choice to ignore its potential benefits. A survey conducted by Charles Schwab revealed that 45% of financial advisors plan to increase their allocations to crypto ETFs within the next year, suggesting a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance.

Hashdex conducted a portfolio analysis demonstrating that adding crypto exposure, represented by the Nasdaq Crypto Index US, to a traditional 60/40 portfolio enhances risk-adjusted returns. While higher allocations may lead to larger drawdowns, the firm emphasizes the importance of position sizing rather than speculative investments.

The report outlines three key predictions for the cryptocurrency landscape in 2026, which serve as a roadmap for potential developments in the sector.

### Top 3 Crypto Predictions for 2026

1. **The Rise of the "Cryptodollar"**: Hashdex predicts stablecoins will play a significant role in reshaping financial dynamics. As some nations attempt to reduce reliance on the US dollar, stablecoins may facilitate a re-dollarization at the user and corporate levels. The firm anticipates stablecoin market capitalization could grow from approximately $295 billion to over $500 billion by 2026. This growth may influence Treasury demand, potentially shortening the average duration of US debt due to the preference for short-duration backing.

2. **Tokenization as a Driving Force**: The firm expects tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) to gain momentum, projecting a growth from about $36 billion at the end of 2025 to approximately $400 billion by the end of 2026. Notably, tokenized Treasury bills have already seen significant growth, increasing from over $700 million two years prior to more than $8 billion. Hashdex cites various real-world applications, such as BlackRock’s liquidity fund and Franklin Templeton’s on-chain government money fund, as evidence that tokenization is moving beyond theoretical discussions.

3. **Decentralized AI Networks**: Hashdex highlights the increasing investment in decentralized AI networks, which garnered nearly $1 billion in funding in 2025. The firm anticipates this segment, termed "AI Crypto," to expand from roughly $3 billion to $10 billion by 2026. This growth is seen as a response to the need for crypto-native infrastructure capable of verification and coordination without centralized control.

The overarching theme of Hashdex's predictions is the transition from exploratory interest in cryptocurrencies to a strategic approach as these elements become interlinked, enhancing the overall demand for crypto infrastructure.

Hashdex’s outlook underscores a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency sector. As traditional finance begins to recognize the benefits of digital assets, the firm’s predictions highlight potential shifts in how cryptocurrencies are integrated into investment strategies. The emphasis on stablecoins, tokenization, and decentralized AI networks suggests that the crypto landscape is evolving, with increasing relevance in the financial markets.
