## Overview

Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has outlined his strategy for Bitcoin accumulation amid expectations of a potential relief rally. Despite his plans to buy Bitcoin at a specific price level, he maintains a bearish outlook for the cryptocurrency in the long term, anticipating further declines.

## Analyst Reveals The Next Buy Level

In a post on X, Doctor Profit disclosed that he is looking to purchase Bitcoin around a price point of $86,000, anticipating a short-term relief bounce. He expressed the belief that Bitcoin may revisit the price range of $97,000 to $107,000 before experiencing another significant decline. This potential movement is viewed as a 20% increase from current levels, which he considers a favorable risk-reward trade. He emphasized the importance of maintaining a tight stop loss to manage risk effectively.

Doctor Profit has gained recognition for accurately predicting the Bitcoin price peak when it was trading near $126,000. Despite his current buying strategy, he remains pessimistic about Bitcoin's long-term prospects, forecasting additional declines in the future. As part of his risk management approach, he plans to place a stop loss at his entry point once he achieves a solid profit, while also maintaining short positions from a previous trading range of $115,000 to $125,000.

## Bitcoin's Current Market Conditions

Doctor Profit has characterized the current state of Bitcoin as "extremely unstable and bearish" in the mid-term. He cautioned that a strong continuation of the downside could occur at any moment, potentially even before Bitcoin reaches the projected range of $97,000 to $107,000. The analyst highlighted the possibility of a deeper and more rapid sell-off, advising those considering purchases to proceed with extreme caution.

He reiterated that his short positions remain active, viewing any upward movement in Bitcoin's price as an opportunity for distribution and liquidity for the next downward leg. Doctor Profit has identified the $70,000 region as a significant target for future price action. Should Bitcoin manage to reach the anticipated $97,000 to $107,000 range, he indicated that he would fully realize profits from his position and reinvest those gains into his short positions.

In a related note, analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted the necessity for Bitcoin to maintain stability above the $87,000 mark, warning that failure to do so could result in a drop to as low as $70,000. This outlook is particularly relevant as Bitcoin's price hovers around $86,600, reflecting a slight increase over the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap data.
