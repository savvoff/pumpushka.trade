## Overview

XRP is currently experiencing significant selling pressure, resulting in a decline to around $1.80. Despite the bearish price action, on-chain data indicates a notable decrease in XRP reserves on Binance, suggesting a potential shift in market dynamics. This situation raises questions about future demand and the overall health of the market.

## Current Market Conditions

XRP's price has struggled to regain bullish momentum, facing persistent selling pressure that has led to a weak price performance. Recent attempts at recovery have not attracted sufficient demand, causing market sentiment to turn defensive among investors. Analysts have expressed concerns that if the current conditions persist, XRP may encounter further downside in the weeks ahead.

A critical data point to consider is the decline in XRP reserves on Binance, which have reached approximately 2.64 billion XRP. This figure represents the lowest level since 2024, indicating that a substantial amount of XRP has been withdrawn from the exchange. The reduction in reserves means there is less XRP available for immediate sale, which could influence market dynamics.

On-chain analysis typically interprets falling exchange reserves as a sign that holders are opting for self-custody of their assets rather than preparing to sell. This divergence between the declining price of XRP and the decrease in exchange reserves complicates the overall market outlook. While there is evident pressure on the market, the lack of rising reserves suggests that the recent price decline is not primarily driven by large-scale selling on exchanges. Instead, it points toward weak demand among buyers.

## Selling Pressure Easing

According to a recent report from CryptoQuant, there has been a significant outflow of XRP from Binance, which is consistent with the observed decline in reserves. Fewer tokens are available for immediate sale, indicating a potential easing of sell-side pressure. Investors appear to be moving XRP into private wallets, suggesting a preference for holding rather than trading actively.

XRP’s price has notably fallen to around $1.80 after failing to maintain levels above $3, which had previously marked a bullish peak. Crucially, this decline in price has occurred without an increase in exchange reserves, a contrast to past market cycles where rising reserves frequently signaled aggressive selling. The current scenario suggests that the weakness in XRP's price is largely due to diminishing demand rather than heavy distribution.

As XRP reserves reach their lowest level since 2024, there may be a potential for the market to establish a more supportive base. Should buying momentum return, the reduced supply on exchanges could lead to more pronounced price movements compared to periods characterized by high reserves.

## Technical Analysis

XRP's price continues to trade within a weakened structure, reflecting a prolonged corrective phase following a significant rejection from the $3.60–$3.70 range. After peaking in late summer, XRP entered a steady downtrend marked by lower highs and persistent selling pressure, eventually breaking below the $2.00 psychological level. This shift in market structure has favored bearish sentiment.

From a technical perspective, XRP is currently below its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which have become dynamic resistance levels. The 200-day moving average, situated near the $1.75–$1.80 region, has emerged as a critical level for traders to monitor. The price is hovering just above this long-term support, indicating that while selling pressure may be slowing, it has not fully dissipated.

## From Author

The current situation surrounding XRP presents a complex scenario for traders and investors. The interplay between declining reserves and weak price action suggests a cautious market environment. While the data points to a potential easing of selling pressure, the ongoing bearish market structure indicates that participants should remain vigilant regarding price movements and market sentiment.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- XRP's price decline to around $1.80 raises concerns about overall market sentiment and potential further downside.
- The decrease in Binance reserves indicates a shift in holder behavior, potentially favoring long-term holding over immediate trading.
- The absence of rising reserves during the price decline suggests that the market is not experiencing aggressive selling, but rather weak demand.
- Technical indicators highlight critical support levels, which could influence future price movements if breached.
- The current market dynamics may lead to increased volatility if buying momentum returns amid reduced supply on exchanges.
