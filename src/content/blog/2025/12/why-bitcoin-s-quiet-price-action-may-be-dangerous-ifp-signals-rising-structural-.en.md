## Overview

Bitcoin is currently facing challenges as it struggles to maintain levels below $90,000, with bulls attempting to defend existing demand zones. After experiencing a notable correction from recent highs, Bitcoin's price action has entered a period of consolidation, which may appear stable on the surface but carries underlying risks.

## Current Price Action and Its Implications

Bitcoin's price has struggled to reclaim higher levels, particularly the $90,000 mark. The market is currently in a consolidation phase following a sharp correction, which has led to a decrease in volatility and short-term price movements suggesting a pause rather than a definitive breakdown. However, this apparent calmness may be deceptive.

According to a report from XWIN Research Japan, on-chain data indicates a growing structural risk within the market. The Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP), a metric that tracks Bitcoin movements between exchanges and serves as a measure of internal market liquidity, has turned red. This color change signifies a concerning trend: in such environments, price movements tend to become sharper and less orderly once a direction is established.

The report highlights that reduced exchange balances can limit immediate selling pressure but also amplify the effects of sudden demand or forced liquidations. This trend suggests a slowdown in the circulation of capital across trading venues, indicating that liquidity conditions are worsening. 

### Understanding the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse

The Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP) serves as a proxy for capital circulation and market liquidity. When the IFP is elevated, capital rotates efficiently between exchanges, allowing for quick absorption of arbitrage opportunities and maintaining deep order books. This environment supports smoother price discovery and contained volatility.

Conversely, a declining IFP indicates weakened internal market liquidity. As capital becomes static and liquidity fragments, prices become increasingly sensitive to relatively small trades. This deterioration is occurring alongside historically low exchange balances, which can initially provide price support due to reduced sellable supply but ultimately lead to thinner order books. 

Once prices begin to move decisively in either direction, the potential for slippage increases, causing volatility to accelerate. With leverage still high across derivatives markets, the current instability is driven less by directional conviction and more by the magnitude of forced reactions. Historically, periods marked by a red IFP have led to abrupt corrections and sharp price swings rather than clean trends.

## From author

The current state of Bitcoin's market structure raises concerns about its vulnerability to sudden price movements. The combination of low liquidity, declining IFP, and high leverage presents a precarious situation for traders. Until there is an improvement in inter-exchange liquidity, Bitcoin may remain at risk of outsized moves, making leveraged positions particularly dangerous in the current market.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Bitcoin's struggle to maintain levels below $90,000 indicates potential instability in the market.
- The decline in the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse suggests growing structural risks and the likelihood of sharp price movements.
- Reduced liquidity conditions can result in heightened volatility, especially during sudden market shifts.
- The current market environment may discourage new investments due to perceived risks, potentially impacting overall market sentiment.
- Traders may face increased challenges in executing trades, as thinner order books can lead to slippage and unexpected price swings.
