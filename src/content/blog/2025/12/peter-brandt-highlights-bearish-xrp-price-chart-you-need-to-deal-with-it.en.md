## Overview

Veteran chartist Peter Brandt has directed attention towards the XRP community, sharing a technical analysis that suggests a bearish trend for the cryptocurrency. His findings indicate a potential double top formation on XRP's weekly chart, which may have significant implications for traders and market participants.

## Technical Analysis Highlights

Peter Brandt's analysis on the social media platform X raises concerns about the current market structure of XRP, which he describes as leaning towards bearish. He emphasizes that traders must acknowledge the implications of the chart rather than dismissing them. According to Brandt, the current setup presents downside risks that cannot be overlooked.

### Potential Double Top Formation

Brandt pointed out the possibility of a double top pattern emerging on XRP’s weekly chart. While he recognized that this pattern could potentially fail, he stressed the importance of the current bearish structure. This analysis is particularly relevant following XRP's recent price action, which has seen the cryptocurrency drop below the $2 price level after a period of consistent bearish movements.

Brandt's remarks target both the general market sentiment and the persistent optimism among XRP enthusiasts. He asserts that his perspective is based on classical chart principles rather than personal bias against the asset. He encourages market participants to confront the reality of the situation, stating, “Love it or not — you need to deal with it.”

### Support and Resistance Levels

The accompanying chart shared by Brandt illustrates XRP's decline below a previously established flag pattern support. This breakdown has brought XRP to the lower boundary of approximately $1.80 to $2.00, a key support area that has held firm twice earlier in the year. However, this level is currently under threat as XRP appears to be testing it for a third time.

Additionally, Brandt notes a flattening of the weekly moving averages on the chart, indicating a weakening of upside momentum compared to earlier phases of the cycle. This observation further reinforces the bearish sentiment surrounding XRP.

### Conditions for a Shift in Outlook

Despite the bearish tone, Brandt clarifies that the double top pattern is conditional and not absolute. He mentions that a sustained move back above the $2 support would delay any potential breakdown into the lower $1 range. Moreover, reclaiming higher levels around $2.2, $2.5, $2.7, and $3 would invalidate the double top pattern, necessitating a reassessment of the overall trend.

## From Author

Brandt's insights serve as a reminder for traders to remain vigilant and responsive to market signals, especially in volatile environments. The emphasis on chart behavior over sentiment underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making in the crypto market.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- Brandt's analysis points to a potential bearish trend, which could influence trader sentiment and behavior towards XRP.
