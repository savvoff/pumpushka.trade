## Overview

Metaplanet has announced the initiation of a sponsored level I American Depositary Receipt (ADR) program aimed at attracting over-the-counter (OTC) investors in the United States. This strategic move is designed to enhance accessibility for U.S. investors, improve settlement quality, and bolster the company's market credibility.

## Sponsored ADR Program

The sponsored level I ADR program allows foreign companies to offer their shares in the U.S. market through American Depositary Receipts. By engaging in this program, Metaplanet is taking significant steps to broaden its investor base in the U.S. The company has emphasized that this initiative is crucial for strengthening U.S. investor access to its offerings.

The sponsored ADR program is particularly important for companies looking to establish a presence in the U.S. financial landscape. Through this mechanism, shares of Metaplanet can be traded more easily, providing a streamlined process for American investors. The listing is expected to improve the settlement quality, which refers to the efficiency and reliability of the transactions involving the company's shares. 

Furthermore, the introduction of this ADR program is anticipated to enhance market credibility for Metaplanet. By complying with U.S. regulatory standards and providing a transparent avenue for investment, the company can build trust with potential investors. This credibility is essential for attracting interest from institutional and retail investors alike.
