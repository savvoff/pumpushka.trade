## Overview

Dogecoin is experiencing significant selling pressure amid a broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market. The memecoin has fallen below key technical levels, raising concerns about a potential deeper correction as market conditions weaken.

## Dogecoin's Struggles Amid Market Weakness

Dogecoin has recently slipped below crucial support areas, breaking a bullish trend line on the hourly chart and continuing a multi-day downtrend. Its price is now trading below the 100-hour simple moving average, with momentum indicators like the MACD showing strengthening bearish signals and the RSI remaining below the neutral level of 50. The coin has declined significantly over a 24-hour period, falling through multiple Fibonacci retracement zones and failing to regain footing above the 23.6% retracement level of its latest swing move. Analysts suggest that immediate resistance lies near the 50% retracement of the recent decline, indicating that a close above this threshold is necessary to alleviate short-term downside pressure.

The persistent inability to break above these resistance areas has tilted momentum toward sellers, with a retest of recent lows likely if the market does not stabilize.

## Weak Market Flows and Derivatives Contraction

The spot market is showing signs of persistent distribution, with recent data indicating a notable outflow. This $5.7 million outflow extends a multi-month trend of reduced accumulation among large holders. Earlier inflows that had previously supported price rallies toward higher levels have been replaced by steady declines, reflecting waning confidence among major players.

In the derivatives markets, the weakening structure is further reinforced by a drop in open interest, which has decreased as traders unwind positions instead of increasing exposure during market declines. While long-short ratios exhibit a mild long bias, the price action has consistently invalidated these positions, leading to frequent long-side liquidations whenever Dogecoin attempts to rise above short-term moving averages. This pattern has kept Dogecoin trapped below declining exponential moving averages, indicating a firmly bearish outlook.

## ETF Disappointment and Market Rotation

The recent launch of Dogecoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has not provided the expected support. Combined inflows from major issuers have only slightly exceeded $2 million, a stark contrast to the stronger debut inflows seen in Bitcoin or Ethereum funds. This lack of demand signals limited institutional interest in Dogecoin, contributing to an overall negative sentiment surrounding the asset.

Simultaneously, market rotation is shifting toward utility-focused assets and payment-driven networks. The declining volume and low activity from large holders suggest that traders may be moving away from meme assets in favor of projects that demonstrate faster adoption and real-world use cases.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- Dogecoin's recent price decline highlights the vulnerability of meme coins in a weakening market.
- The significant outflows from large holders reflect a trend of reduced confidence among major players in the crypto space.
- The disappointing performance of Dogecoin ETFs indicates limited institutional interest, which may affect future investment in similar assets.
- Ongoing market rotation toward utility-focused projects suggests a shift in trader preferences, potentially impacting the demand for meme coins.
- The bearish trend observed in Dogecoin could foreshadow broader market corrections if conditions do not stabilize.
