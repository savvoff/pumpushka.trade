## Overview

Tom Lee, the Chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies, has made a significant statement regarding Ethereum, indicating that he believes the cryptocurrency has reached its lowest point. In response to this belief, BitMine is actively purchasing Ethereum, signaling a bullish outlook from the firm.

## Ethereum's Status According to BitMine
