## Overview

Strategy Stock has faced a significant decline, leading to a major price target cut. This situation has raised concerns regarding the company's ability to issue equity at a premium, which is crucial for its long-term plans.

## Recent Developments

Analyst Brett Knoblauch noted that the lower adjusted net asset value multiple has impacted Strategy's position in the market. As a result, the company can no longer issue equity at a premium. This development poses a threat to Strategy's long-term strategy, specifically its goal of accumulating more bitcoin. The inability to raise capital effectively could hinder its operational capabilities and future growth prospects.

## Impact on the crypto market
