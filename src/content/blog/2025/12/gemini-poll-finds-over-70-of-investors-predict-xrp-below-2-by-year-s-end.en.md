## Overview

As 2025 approaches, XRP investors are increasingly adopting a bearish outlook, with many predicting that the altcoin will remain below the critical $2 mark. A recent poll conducted by cryptocurrency exchange Gemini highlights a significant shift in market sentiment regarding XRP's future performance.

## XRP Forecasts Dipped

Conducted between December 12 and December 23, the Gemini poll reveals that 73% of investors predict XRP will finish the year between $1.50 and $2.00. This marks a notable decline in optimism compared to earlier sentiments, where approximately 38% of traders were anticipating a rally to the $2.00 to $2.50 range by December 31. This figure has since dropped to 28%, indicating a significant reduction in confidence among investors.

The outlook for XRP reaching higher price levels has also shifted dramatically. Only about 4% of respondents believe that XRP will reach the $2.50 to $3.00 range, and a similar percentage predicts it could exceed $3.00. The consensus around the $1.50 to $2.00 range has increased from 63% earlier in the poll, suggesting a growing alignment among participants regarding this price point as the most likely scenario for year-end.

Additionally, the sentiment towards a potential drop below $1.50 has risen slightly to 7%, up from 6%. Most participants, however, do not foresee a sharp sell-off occurring, indicating a degree of stability in their expectations.

## Rising Supply From Early Investors

The prevailing bearish sentiment aligns with Futures data that indicates a prevalence of aggressive sell orders. Meanwhile, the slow accumulation of XRP in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at a pace of $30 to $50 million daily is unable to keep up with profit-taking and risk reduction activities in the market. On-chain data reveals that significant realized gains have been secured as XRP approached recent highs. 

For instance, a long-term holder who initially acquired the altcoin around $0.40 sold over 350 million tokens at approximately $2.00, achieving an estimated profit of $721 million. This cashing out by early investors at the $2 level has resulted in minimal support for dip-buying, which could otherwise help bolster the price. Consequently, XRP has remained in its current trading range of $1.7 to $1.8.

Experts suggest that the increase in supply from long-term holders, who originally invested at prices ranging from $0.40 to $0.60, creates a resistance ceiling that is challenging to breach without substantial new demand entering the market. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $1.830 and has recorded major losses across all time frames, reflecting a year-to-date decline of 15%, consistent with the overall performance of the broader market.

## From author

The bearish sentiment surrounding XRP reflects a cautious outlook among investors as they navigate a market characterized by uncertainty. The shift in forecasts indicates a consolidation of expectations that could influence trading strategies moving forward. As early investors realize profits and sell off their holdings, the market dynamics for XRP become more complex and challenging.

## Impact on the crypto market

- A significant majority of investors are now predicting a finish below $2 for XRP, indicating a bearish trend.
- The decline in confidence is mirrored by a drop in expected price ranges, suggesting a lack of bullish sentiment.
- Increased selling pressure from early investors could lead to further price resistance.
- The inability of ETFs to support price levels amidst profit-taking activities highlights the fragility of market demand.
- Overall, XRP's performance is reflective of broader market trends, with a year-to-date decline consistent with other cryptocurrencies.
