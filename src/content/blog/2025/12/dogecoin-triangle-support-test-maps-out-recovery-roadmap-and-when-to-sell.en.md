## Overview

Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently testing a critical support area within a long-term triangle pattern, which could significantly influence its future price direction. A recent technical analysis by a crypto analyst highlights key recovery levels and suggests potential points for selling and profit-taking.

## Dogecoin Triangle Pattern Signals Recovery Path

In a recent analysis shared on X, crypto analyst Jonathan Carter examined Dogecoin’s price action, indicating that a recovery may be on the horizon. Dogecoin is testing a vital support area around $0.135, situated within a long-standing descending triangle chart structure. This analysis is based on a 3-day timeframe, with the price remaining above the triangle's lower boundary. This specific zone has become a battleground for buyers and sellers, making it a crucial point of interest.

Carter's analysis points out that the current support area presents a favorable risk-reward profile for market participants. Buyers are actively attempting to prevent a breakdown below this level, which would compromise the broader recovery outlook. If Dogecoin can maintain its position above this support zone, it may uphold a bullish scenario.

The descending triangle pattern depicted in Carter's analysis illustrates a sequence of lower highs that are pressing against the stable support zone at $0.135. This compression often precedes a significant price movement once the price reacts decisively at the base. The current market structure suggests that Dogecoin is nearing a critical inflection point.

Additionally, the volume data at the bottom of Carter's chart has not shown strong expansion near this support area, indicating that trading activity has been relatively subdued. This muted activity suggests that the market may be awaiting further confirmation before committing to a substantial upward move.

Should Dogecoin successfully rebound from the $0.135 support zone, Carter's chart outlines several upside targets to monitor. Initial recovery levels are identified around $0.155 and $0.190, where previous price reactions have occurred. Surpassing these levels could indicate growing momentum and a potential end to Dogecoin's downtrend. Further upside extensions are projected at $0.250 and $0.310, which align with previous consolidation zones. A stronger continuation could pave the way toward $0.370 and the resistance zone near $0.470.

## Resistance Zone Reveals When To Sell DOGE

Carter's analysis also highlights the $0.47 resistance zone, where sellers are likely to become active once again. A rally that reaches this zone would probably encounter increased selling pressure based on historical price behavior. Consequently, this resistance area serves as a strategic level for profit-taking rather than as an entry point for new investments in Dogecoin.

Overall, Carter's analysis suggests that Dogecoin's price is at a pivotal technical level that could dictate its next significant move. Despite experiencing a decline of over 22% year-to-date, Carter maintains an optimistic outlook regarding Dogecoin's recovery path.
