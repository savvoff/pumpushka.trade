## Overview

Billionaire investor Ray Dalio has expressed heightened caution regarding Bitcoin's suitability as an official reserve asset. While he acknowledges Bitcoin's scarcity and money-like qualities, he emphasizes significant concerns that prevent central banks from adopting it in the same manner as gold.

## Dalio's Insights on Bitcoin

In recent interviews, Ray Dalio highlighted that Bitcoin possesses characteristics akin to traditional money due to its limited supply. However, he firmly stated that it is unlikely to be held significantly by central banks. The primary reason for this skepticism lies in the transparency of Bitcoin transactions, which Dalio believes poses risks for reserve managers. He noted that public transaction records can be traced and potentially interrupted, raising concerns about the security of national wealth.

Dalio contrasted Bitcoin's traceability with gold, arguing that once gold is removed from the formal financial system, it becomes more challenging for authorities to exert control over it. This distinction is crucial for institutions responsible for safeguarding national assets, as they must consider the vulnerabilities associated with holding an asset that is publicly traceable.

Moreover, Dalio expressed apprehensions regarding the security of Bitcoin itself. He warned that there is a possibility of Bitcoin being compromised or controlled in ways that could undermine its long-term viability as a store of value. These concerns contribute to his cautious stance on Bitcoin as a reserve asset.

## Stablecoins and Their Limitations

In addition to his views on Bitcoin, Dalio also commented on stablecoins, rating them poorly as long-term holdings. He pointed out that stablecoins are linked to fiat currencies and do not generally offer interest, making them suitable for quick transactions but ineffective for wealth preservation. While he maintains some personal exposure to Bitcoin, he places a higher value on gold when considering assets that can shield against state actions.
