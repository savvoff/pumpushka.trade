## Overview

Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade represents a significant shift in the network's approach to scaling. By opting for faster, targeted changes instead of large-scale hard forks, the upgrade aims to enhance the strategic development of the Ethereum network.

## What Happened

Bitwise Onchain Solutions has highlighted the core features of Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade. This upgrade is designed to improve scalability by implementing changes that are more focused and efficient. This targeted approach allows for adjustments to be made without the need for disruptive big-bang hard forks. Such a strategy enables the Ethereum network to evolve in a more controlled and strategic manner, ultimately benefiting its overall performance and usability.

## Impact on the crypto market

- The Fusaka upgrade enhances Ethereum's scalability, potentially attracting more developers and projects to the network.
- Targeted changes may lead to increased stability and reduced risks associated with large-scale updates.
- The strategic nature of the upgrade could position Ethereum as a more competitive platform in the evolving blockchain landscape.
- Improved scalability might enhance user experience and adoption rates within the Ethereum ecosystem.
- The upgrade reflects a shift in how blockchain networks can approach development, influencing future upgrades in other cryptocurrencies.
