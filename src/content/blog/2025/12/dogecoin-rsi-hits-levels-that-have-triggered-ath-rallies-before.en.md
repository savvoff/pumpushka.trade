## Overview

Dogecoin has recently experienced a notable event as its weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached a critical level that has historically indicated significant turning points for the cryptocurrency. After a period of decline, Dogecoin's RSI has dropped into a zone that has previously signaled opportunities for price recovery.

## Current Situation

According to technical analysis, Dogecoin’s weekly RSI has fallen into a narrow range around the 33 level. This condition has only occurred four times in the asset's approximately eleven-year trading history. Each of these previous instances has coincided with periods where selling pressure diminished, even though immediate price reversals were not observed. Instead, these phases were characterized by quiet accumulation, laying the groundwork for future price increases.

The historical instances of Dogecoin's RSI dipping into this lower band occurred in 2015, 2020, and 2022. In each case, after the RSI reached this level, the price established extended basing ranges, which eventually led to the next sustained price advance. As of late 2025, Dogecoin’s RSI is once again displaying this structural behavior, suggesting a potential bullish scenario for the cryptocurrency.

Short-term oversold readings are often seen as reversal indicators, but they can lead to false starts. However, the current RSI setup is on a weekly timeframe, which tends to be more reliable and typically emerges during broader market resets. During these resets, the RSI has historically stabilized and rebounded from the 30 to 33 range, indicating a transition from consolidation to a new uptrend.

As of mid-December 2025, Dogecoin is trading in the low-$0.13 to mid-$0.14 range, having recently slipped below the $0.14 mark that had served as a short-term support level. This trading range has witnessed volatility, with prices fluctuating between approximately $0.13 and $0.15. The market is currently experiencing a struggle between buyers and sellers, with sellers prevailing at this time, leading to a 5% decline in Dogecoin's price over the past 24 hours.

Despite the current downward trend, the weekly RSI at a historically significant level offers additional context for potential future price action. It suggests that Dogecoin may be nearing a price bottom, potentially allowing buyers to regain control in the coming weeks. However, given the nature of the weekly indicator, it is plausible that Dogecoin's price may continue to consolidate around this level for several weeks before any significant upward movement occurs.

## From author
