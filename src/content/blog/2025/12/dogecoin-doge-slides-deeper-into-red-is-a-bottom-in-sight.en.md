## Overview

Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced a significant decline, falling below the $0.1400 threshold against the US Dollar. This downward trend suggests ongoing challenges for the cryptocurrency, as it consolidates losses and faces potential resistance levels that could hinder any recovery attempts.

## Current Situation

The recent price movement of Dogecoin indicates a fresh decline that began after it closed below the $0.1420 mark, mirroring trends seen in other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. After dipping below the critical support levels of $0.1400 and $0.1380, the price even fell below $0.1350, establishing a low near $0.1326. Although there was a minor correction, the price remains below important thresholds, including the 100-hourly simple moving average and the $0.1400 level.

Currently, there is a key bearish trend line forming, with resistance identified at $0.1375 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. If the price continues to stay below the $0.1400 and $0.1420 levels, it could extend its losses. In the event of a recovery, immediate resistance is positioned near the $0.1380 mark, while the first significant resistance for bulls is close to $0.1400. Furthermore, the next major resistance level is around $0.1425, coinciding with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent downward movement.

Should the price manage to close above the $0.1425 resistance, it could potentially advance toward $0.1450, with further gains leading to targets near $0.1500 and eventually $0.1550. However, the outlook remains cautious, as a failure to rise above the $0.140 level may result in additional declines.

On the downside, initial support is near the $0.1340 level, followed by major support at $0.1325 and the main support level at $0.130. A breach below the $0.130 support could lead to further declines, potentially sliding toward levels like $0.1250 or even $0.1240 in the near term.

### Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for DOGE/USD is currently gaining momentum in the bearish zone, indicating an ongoing negative trend.
- **Hourly RSI**: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for DOGE/USD is above the 50 level, suggesting a mixed sentiment among traders.
