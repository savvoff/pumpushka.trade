## Overview

Rep. Keith Self has introduced an amendment aimed at banning central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in a defense bill, responding to Republican concerns over the failure to uphold commitments regarding CBDCs. This development comes ahead of a significant hearing, highlighting the ongoing debate surrounding digital currencies and their implications for the financial system.

## What Happened

Rep. Keith Self's amendment seeks to address Republican grievances about the lack of a firm commitment to prohibit central bank digital currencies within the context of a defense bill. The push for this amendment reflects a broader Republican outcry regarding the potential risks associated with CBDCs, particularly in relation to privacy, government control, and the integrity of the financial system.

The introduction of the amendment is a direct response to the frustrations expressed by some Republican lawmakers who believe that the inclusion of CBDCs in government policy could undermine individual financial freedoms. This sentiment has been echoed by various political figures who argue that CBDCs may lead to increased surveillance and control over personal transactions.

The timing of this amendment is critical, as it precedes a key hearing that could shape the future of CBDC discussions in Congress. By introducing this amendment now, Rep. Self aims to ensure that the issue of CBDCs is addressed before any further legislative action is taken. This move underscores the importance of the topic within the current political climate, especially as discussions around digital currencies continue to gain traction among lawmakers.
