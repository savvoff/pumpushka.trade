## Overview

A Singapore entrepreneur, Mark Koh, has suffered a significant loss of his entire cryptocurrency portfolio due to a malware incident. The malware was downloaded after he interacted with a fake game, demonstrating the potential risks associated with online gaming and cryptocurrency security.

## Incident Details

This malware had the capability to steal wallet credentials without the need for browser wallets to be open. 

The implications of this incident are profound, particularly for those who engage with online platforms that may not have robust security measures. The malware's ability to access sensitive information without requiring the user to actively engage with their wallets raises concerns about the vulnerabilities present in both software and user behavior.
