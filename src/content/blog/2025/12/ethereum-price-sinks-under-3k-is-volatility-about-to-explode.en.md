## Overview

Ethereum's price has experienced a significant decline, dipping below the $3,000 mark. This downward movement follows a failure to maintain higher levels, leading to a consolidation phase that may precede an attempt to recover above $2,980.

## Current Market Situation

Ethereum began its recent decline from the $3,175 zone, indicating a bearish trend that has pushed the price below critical support levels. As of now, the price is trading below $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, which adds to the bearish sentiment. A bearish trend line is forming, with resistance identified at $3,120 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

This decline mirrors trends observed in Bitcoin, as Ethereum's price fell below both $3,120 and $3,050, entering what is classified as a bearish zone. A low was established at $2,916, and the price is currently consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the previous high of $3,175 to the recent low of $2,916.

The current trading scenario indicates that if Ethereum can manage to move upward, it may face resistance near the $2,980 level. Further resistance levels are identified at $3,050 and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, which also corresponds to the downward movement from the $3,175 swing high to the $2,916 low. The immediate major resistance level is observed at $3,080, and a decisive move above this level could push prices toward $3,120, potentially facilitating further gains.

However, if Ethereum fails to surpass the $2,980 resistance, it may lead to additional declines. Initial support is noted near the $2,950 level, with the first major support located around $2,920. A clear breach below this support could drive the price down toward $2,880 and potentially lower to the $2,840 region, with a significant support level identified at $2,800.

## Technical Analysis

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum within the bearish zone, indicating a strengthening bearish trend.
- **Hourly RSI**: The RSI for ETH/USD is currently below the 50 mark, reflecting bearish momentum.
- **Major Support Level**: The first major support is at $2,920.
- **Major Resistance Level**: The first significant resistance is at $3,080.

## From author

The recent price movements in Ethereum indicate a period of volatility that traders should monitor closely. The interplay between resistance and support levels will be critical in determining the next direction for ETH. As the market awaits potential recovery signals, the current technical indicators suggest a cautious approach is warranted.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Ethereum's decline below $3,000 could influence investor sentiment, potentially leading to increased caution among traders.
- The formation of a bearish trend line highlights the ongoing challenges faced by ETH, which may affect its attractiveness relative to other cryptocurrencies.
- Support and resistance levels are crucial for traders, as they may dictate short-term trading strategies and risk management.
