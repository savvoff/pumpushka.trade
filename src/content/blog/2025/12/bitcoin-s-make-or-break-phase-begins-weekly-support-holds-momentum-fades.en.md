## Overview

Bitcoin is currently navigating a pivotal phase as it hovers around significant weekly support levels while experiencing waning momentum. The cryptocurrency has encountered multiple rejections at key resistance points, indicating that buyers are struggling to maintain control over price movements. This situation is critical, as the next steps could determine whether Bitcoin stabilizes or descends into a more profound correction.

## Current Situation

Bitcoin's price has recently faced a notable rejection at a key resistance level, as highlighted by crypto analyst Michael Van De Poppe. This rejection suggests that the ongoing short-term downtrend remains in effect, with selling pressure currently dominating over buying momentum. The analyst points out that a breakout above a specific level is necessary to change this bearish sentiment. If Bitcoin can successfully move above this resistance, it could signal the end of the current corrective phase and potentially initiate upward momentum.

However, should buyers fail to break through this resistance, the likelihood of Bitcoin targeting lower liquidity levels increases. Analysts have indicated that the price may seek liquidity below the current levels, particularly around a designated target. This scenario underscores the uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin's price trajectory in the near term.

Additionally, the broader economic context plays a significant role in Bitcoin's performance. With numerous macroeconomic events scheduled for the week, including meetings from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), there is potential for heightened volatility in the market. The outcome of these events may influence Bitcoin's price movements and liquidity tests.

## Weekly Support and Market Structure

Despite the recent rejection at a notable resistance level, Bitcoin's price action remains somewhat constructive as it holds above a crucial weekly support zone. This support area is reinforced by the 100-week moving average, making it an essential level for traders and investors to monitor. According to insights from Crypto Damus, while the weekly structure appears intact for now, the possibility of deeper downside movements cannot be ignored.

The broader market structure indicates that a full retracement toward a specific breakdown target is still a consideration. This potential move aligns with previous lows, suggesting that a corrective phase could unfold in a more significant manner. Such a scenario could present long-term opportunities for investors, particularly if Bitcoin revisits certain key price levels during a potential pullback.

## From author

The current state of Bitcoin reflects a delicate balance between support and resistance, with market participants closely watching for signs of either a reversal or further decline. The interplay between technical indicators and macroeconomic factors creates a complex environment, necessitating careful analysis for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency space. As Bitcoin navigates this critical phase, the implications of its price movements will be keenly felt across the broader market.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Bitcoin's ability to maintain its position above key support levels will influence trader sentiment and market stability.
- Continued rejections at resistance levels may lead to increased selling pressure, affecting overall market confidence.
- The outcome of macroeconomic events could introduce significant volatility, impacting not just Bitcoin but the broader cryptocurrency market.
- A deeper corrective phase could result in strategic buying opportunities for long-term investors.
- The interplay between technical analysis and macroeconomic conditions will be crucial in shaping future price movements.
