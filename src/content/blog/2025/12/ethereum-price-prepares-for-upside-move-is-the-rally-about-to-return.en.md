## Overview

Ethereum's price has recently begun to rise, moving above the $3,150 mark and showing signs of potential consolidation. As it aims for a breakout above the $3,350 resistance level, the developments in Ethereum's price movement are critical for traders and investors alike.

## Current Price Movement

Ethereum's price has started a fresh increase, surpassing the $3,150 threshold. Following a downside correction from the $3,450 zone, it is currently trading above $3,200 and is supported by the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A bullish trend line is forming with support established at $3,180 on the hourly chart for ETH/USD. 

This upward momentum is significant because it indicates the potential for further gains if Ethereum can maintain its position above critical support levels. Despite some fluctuations, including a move below $3,250 and a dip beneath the 50% Fib retracement level from a previous swing low, Ethereum has shown resilience by bouncing back above the $3,150 mark.

The price action has seen Ethereum gain strength, even overtaking Bitcoin in recent trading sessions. It has successfully broken through resistance levels at $3,300 and $3,320, with the bulls pushing the price above $3,400. However, selling pressure has emerged below the $3,450 threshold, leading to a correction where a high was recorded at $3,448.

### Resistance and Support Levels

As Ethereum continues to consolidate its gains, it faces key resistance levels approaching $3,290, $3,320, and $3,350. A decisive move above the $3,350 resistance could pave the way for further upward momentum, potentially targeting the $3,400 region and possibly beyond to the $3,450 or even $3,500 levels.

Conversely, if Ethereum fails to break above the $3,320 resistance, it may initiate a fresh decline. Initial support is observed near the $3,200 level, while major support resides around $3,150. A clear move below this support could lead to further declines, with the next key supports identified at $3,040 and $3,000.

## Technical Indicators

- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for ETH/USD is currently gaining momentum in the bullish zone, indicating positive price movement.
- **Hourly RSI**: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for ETH/USD is positioned above the 50 zone, suggesting bullish sentiment.

## From Author
