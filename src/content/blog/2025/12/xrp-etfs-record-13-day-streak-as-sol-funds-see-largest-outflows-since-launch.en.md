## Overview

The recent performance of XRP Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has marked a significant milestone, achieving a 13-day streak of positive net flows, totaling over $200 million. In contrast, Solana (SOL) ETFs have faced challenges, experiencing their largest outflows since their launch.

## XRP ETFs' Performance

XRP ETFs have demonstrated remarkable resilience amid growing institutional demand and a recovering crypto market. The funds recorded their thirteenth consecutive day of positive net flows, which included inflows of $50.27 million on December 3. This performance is largely attributed to the launch of Canary Capital’s XRPC, the first single-token XRP spot ETF, on November 13. 

Since then, XRP ETFs have emerged as the fastest-growing category among altcoin-based investment products. The initial launch of XRPC on Nasdaq attracted a total volume of $58 million and achieved approximately $357.54 million in positive net flows over the 13-day period. The second group of XRP funds debuted last week, marking the largest US ETF launches of 2025, each with over $60 million in net inflows on their first day.

During the first three days of December, XRP ETFs accumulated a total of $207.66 million in net inflows, surpassing the inflows of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs during the same timeframe. Overall, XRP ETFs have garnered $874.28 million in inflows in just 13 days, outpacing the $618.62 million total inflows recorded by SOL ETFs.

## Solana ETFs' Struggles

In contrast to the success of XRP ETFs, Solana ETFs have experienced a downturn in demand. This week, they recorded their largest outflows since their launch, with $32.9 million exiting on December 3. This marked the third day of negative net flows since the category debuted on October 28. 

Despite some positive inflows from products such as Bitwise’s BSOL, Fidelity’s FSOL, and Grayscale’s GSOL, these funds were unable to counterbalance the significant outflows from 21Shares’ TSOL, which saw $41.8 million in outflows. The negative trend continued for TSOL, marking its fourth negative day within the past week.

Although Solana ETFs had a strong performance in November, with $613 million in inflows during a 22-day positive streak, the momentum has waned. The streak ended a week ago when TSOL recorded negative net flows for the first time, and subsequent days have seen continued outflows, including $8.1 million and $13.5 million at the start of December.

## Impact on the Crypto Market

- XRP ETFs have shown a robust performance, indicating strong institutional interest in this altcoin.
- The success of XRP ETFs may influence the development of similar investment products for other cryptocurrencies.
- The contrasting performance of Solana ETFs highlights the volatility and unpredictability of altcoin investments.
- The outflows from Solana ETFs could signal a shift in investor sentiment, potentially affecting the broader market for altcoins.
- The data on both XRP and Solana ETFs provides insights into market trends and investor behavior in the evolving crypto landscape.
