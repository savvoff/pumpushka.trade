## Overview

Solana has experienced a fresh upward movement, surpassing key price levels and establishing a bullish trend. Currently, the price is consolidating above a critical support zone, indicating potential for further gains.

## Price Movement and Technical Analysis

Solana's price began to rise significantly after it settled above the $128 mark. The cryptocurrency surpassed the $135 level, entering a positive short-term zone. Following this increase, the price broke through the $140 resistance, with bullish momentum pushing it above $142. 

At present, Solana is trading above $140 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. A bullish trend line is forming with support at $143 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The price now faces a resistance level near $145, with significant resistance also identified at the $148 and $150 levels. A successful close above the $150 resistance could lead to a sustained upward trend, with the next key resistance at $162.

If Solana's price fails to break above the $145 resistance, it may experience a pullback. Initial downside support is located near the $143 zone and the trend line, while further support exists at the $135 level and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent upward move. A decline below the $135 level could lead the price toward the $128 support zone, with potential further declines toward $120 if the $128 support is breached.

## Impact on the crypto market

- Solana's upward movement reflects broader market trends, particularly the positive movements seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum.
- The consolidation above critical support levels indicates investor confidence and potential for further gains.
- Resistance levels identified may influence trading strategies and market sentiment.
- The potential for a pullback adds a layer of caution for traders, highlighting the importance of monitoring key support levels.
- Technical indicators, such as the MACD and RSI, suggest mixed signals, which may impact trading decisions in the short term.
