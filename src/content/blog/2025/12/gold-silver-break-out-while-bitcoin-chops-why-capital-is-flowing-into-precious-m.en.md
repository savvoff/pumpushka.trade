## Overview

Bitcoin is facing significant challenges as it struggles to reclaim the $90,000 level amid deteriorating market confidence. In contrast, gold and silver have shown resilience and continued to rise, indicating a shift in investor sentiment towards safer assets. This divergence raises questions about Bitcoin's role in the current macroeconomic landscape.

## Current Market Conditions

Bitcoin has been unable to regain momentum, with analysts increasingly predicting a prolonged bear market. The current sentiment is cautious, as investors reassess their risk exposure in anticipation of a challenging market environment. Despite several attempts to stabilize, Bitcoin's price action remains compressed, failing to provide signs of bullish momentum returning.

According to an analysis by XWIN Research Japan, the market phase for Bitcoin can be described as a range-bound consolidation following a significant correction. This analysis reveals that momentum is tilted to the downside. Over the past three months, Bitcoin has traded sideways, contrasting sharply with the upward trajectory of traditional safe-haven assets like gold and silver. The demand for these metals has risen due to persistent geopolitical tensions, policy uncertainties, and expectations of lower real interest rates.

This divergence underscores a structural challenge for Bitcoin in the prevailing macroeconomic context. Capital flows towards precious metals are facilitated by deep liquidity, established market infrastructure, and clear regulatory frameworks, making them more attractive to institutional investors. Silver, in particular, has seen increased interest, benefiting from tighter supply dynamics and heightened sensitivity to speculative flows.

### Bitcoin's Position as a Risk Asset

Bitcoin's status as a high-beta risk asset limits its potential upside in the current environment. In times of risk aversion, investors typically prioritize safety by moving capital into gold and government bonds before considering Bitcoin. This pattern indicates that Bitcoin is often a secondary choice, attracting capital flows only after overall market confidence improves.

The analysis suggests that Bitcoin's demand structure is more vulnerable to short-term positioning and marginal demand compared to gold, which has a more stable and long-term buyer base. Recent data from CryptoQuant shows that Bitcoin's demand has turned negative, indicating a lack of fresh demand even as prices remain relatively high. Additionally, the Short-Term Holder SOPR has been below 1 for an extended period, signaling that short-term participants are selling at a loss or near breakeven. This behavior adds selling pressure during price rebounds, as these holders may look to exit their positions when prices rise.

As long as capital continues to favor gold and silver, Bitcoin's internal demand structure remains a significant constraint. The prevailing outlook suggests continued support for precious metals, while Bitcoin's upside potential remains limited due to weak demand and pressure from short-term holders.

## Price Dynamics and Support Levels

Currently, Bitcoin is trading near the $87,000–$88,000 range following a sharp corrective move from recent highs above $110,000. The price has lost its short-term bullish structure and is now below the 50-day moving average, which is beginning to slope downward. This trend confirms a negative short-term momentum, with increasing overhead supply during potential rallies.

Bitcoin is also testing the 100-day moving average, which has acted as dynamic support throughout much of its current cycle. The market's response around this level is crucial; sustaining above the 100-day MA could allow for stabilization and base formation, while a decisive breakdown could expose the 200-day moving average, which is currently rising in the low $80,000s.

Volume dynamics further reinforce a cautious outlook, as the sell-off from the October peak was accompanied by elevated trading volume, indicating distribution rather than a minor pullback. Since then, volume has tapered off, suggesting a lack of aggressive dip-buying interest at current levels. Although Bitcoin remains in a broader uptrend while above the 200-day MA, the loss of the 50-day and weakening momentum indicate potential consolidation or further downside risk in the near term.

## From author

The contrasting performance of Bitcoin against gold and silver highlights a critical moment in the cryptocurrency market. As investors navigate uncertain economic conditions, the preference for traditional safe-haven assets could reshape Bitcoin's future demand. The ongoing analysis and market behavior will be essential in determining whether Bitcoin can regain its footing or if it will continue to lag behind its more stable counterparts.
