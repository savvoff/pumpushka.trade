## Overview

Sharplink co-CEO Joseph Chalom has made a bold prediction regarding Ethereum's total value locked (TVL), suggesting a potential tenfold increase by 2026, contingent on certain on-chain trends. This forecast is closely linked to the rising use of stablecoins, the growing tokenization of real-world assets, and increasing interest from major financial institutions.

## Ethereum's Total Value Locked (TVL) Forecast

Chalom's prediction highlights several key factors that could drive Ethereum's TVL growth. He notes that the total stablecoin market currently stands at approximately $308 billion and could reach around $500 billion by the end of the next year, representing a significant increase. Notably, over half of all stablecoin activity—approximately 54%—occurs on the Ethereum network. This high volume of stablecoin transactions can positively impact Ethereum's TVL, as these funds often remain in smart contracts for various purposes such as swaps, lending, and liquidity pools.

In addition, Sharplink Gaming, the company co-led by Chalom, currently holds a significant amount of Ether, indicating that some public treasuries are making substantial investments in the Ethereum network. The current holdings amount to 797,704 Ether, valued at around $2.30 billion.

## Growth of Tokenized Real-World Assets

Chalom also anticipates a rapid expansion of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), forecasting a market size of $300 billion for RWAs by 2026. He believes that tokenized assets will see a tenfold increase in assets under management (AUM) next year, as various financial instruments such as funds, stocks, and bonds become tokenized on the blockchain. 

Chalom points to the increasing interest from mainstream financial institutions, including notable firms like JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and BlackRock, as a driving force behind this trend. Reports suggest that sovereign wealth funds may significantly boost their exposure to Ethereum, potentially increasing their investments by five to ten times. This influx of capital could provide substantial support for tokenization projects and protocol deposits within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Ethereum Price Action

As of December 25, 2025, Ethereum was trading in the vicinity of $2,921, which corresponds to a market capitalization of about $352 billion. The trading volume for Ethereum over the prior 24 hours was approximately $11.47 billion. Throughout 2025, Ethereum experienced considerable price volatility, starting the year around $3,298, peaking at about $4,390 in August, and eventually declining to the $2,921 range by year-end. 

Technical indicators reflect a mixed momentum for Ethereum. The weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 41.7, placing Ethereum in a neutral-to-bearish territory, while the daily Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram shows a negative value. Additionally, Ethereum's price has been contained within a narrow range between $2,774 and $3,038. 

Recent futures data indicates a cautious market sentiment, with total open interest near $37 billion, reflecting a slight decrease. Furthermore, liquidation data reveals potential long liquidations clustered around the $2,880 to $2,910 range, which could act as a pressure point for price movements.

## From author

Chalom's optimistic outlook for Ethereum's TVL growth underscores the potential impact of stablecoins and tokenized assets in the blockchain ecosystem. However, the mixed technical indicators and market sentiment suggest that while the infrastructure for growth is being laid, actual price gains may not materialize as quickly as some might hope. The interplay between market conditions and the influx of institutional capital will be crucial to watch in the coming months.

## Impact on the crypto market

- A significant increase in stablecoin usage on Ethereum could enhance the network's liquidity and overall TVL.
- The anticipated growth of tokenized assets may lead to increased adoption of blockchain technology in traditional finance.
- Institutional interest from major financial firms could bring substantial capital into Ethereum, potentially stabilizing its market position.
- Ethereum's price volatility could be exacerbated by liquidation clusters, affecting trader sentiment and market dynamics.
- The interplay between Ethereum's performance and Bitcoin conditions will be critical in shaping future price trajectories.
